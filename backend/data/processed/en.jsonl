Nrityanchal has been one of the leading dance companies in Bangladesh for over a decade. To celebrate their success in the dance firmament, the troupe organised a three-day festival, Nrityanchal Utshab 2016, from April 27-29, which happens to be International Dance Day. The curtains were raised on the first night of the festival with a set 'Kathak Sandhya' at the National Theatre Hall Auditorium of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA), to a soulful guru vandana, presented by what seemed like an incalculable swarm of dancers adorned in serene blue and white costumes. The vandana was followed by a welcome speech presented by the directors of the festival and co-founders of Nrityanchal, Shibli Mohammad and Shameem Ara Nipa. They were joined on stage by the coordinator of Nrityanchal, Muhammad Jahangir, as well as the chief guest for the evening, Bharatanatyam virtuoso Leela Samson and special guest, artist Mustafa Manwar. Subsequently, the director duo paid homage to Gurumata Rahija Khanam Jhunu for her countless contributions to dance over the years. [gallery id=\"1216186\"][/gallery] The first performance of the Kathak Sandhya was a pure classical segment, presented by a group of eight senior students of Nrityanchal, covering tukra, tehai, paran, amad, gat nikas and lari amongst others on teentaal, accompanied by live musicians. Following this, a solo thumri was performed by Monira Parveen Happy, which personified Radha-Krishna's activities during a Holi festival. The show progressed with a number of pure classical pieces including a tarana and a gat bhao named \"Makhan Chor\". Next, the performers presented a rather unique routine combining several Bollywood dance items, which were originally Kathak choreographies, taken from movies ranging from \"Mughal-E-Azam\" to \"Bajirao Mastani\". The last performance, entitled \"Pathshala\", brought to stage 200 students of Nrityanchal performing fragments of Kathak, such as tukra and tehai, in subdivided groups. The evening concluded with the two directors joining the students on stage for a footwork finale. Kathak Sandhya was choreographed by Shibli Mohammad and dedicated to his guru, Kathak legend Pandit Birju Maharaj. On the second day of the festival, Srishti Cultural Center, in collaboration with Nrityanchal, staged their production \"Badi Bandar Roopkotha\", which is based on the story \"Alibaba O Chollish Chor\". The final set of the festival will be performed today by underprivileged children as well as children with special needs at the Nandan Mancha of BSA.

To celebrate the 55th anniversary of Asian Cultural Council (ACC), a gala night will take place today in New York. ACC will honour its 2017 JDR 3rd Award recipient, Shen Wei (Dance, 1995) and two of ACC's most steadfast advocates, David and Susan Rockefeller. The event, chaired by Wendy O'Neill and Mercedes Zobel, is as much recognition of ACC's longstanding commitment to promoting cultural exchange as it is a celebration of ACC's global community of alumni and friends. While ACC provides the resources, network, and programmatic planning that facilitates immersive cultural exchange, it is our fellows who live out ACC's mission of strengthening international dialogue, understanding, and respecting both during their fellowship and long into the future. Celebrating this amazing community, the night will feature performances by four ACC alumni--Susie Ibarra (Music), Kalidas Karmakar (Visual Art), Nina Kuo (Visual Art), and Yasuno Miyauchi (Music). Among them, Kalidas Karmakar will represent Bangladesh in New York. He is the representative of contemporary visual artists of South Asia as well. “New York is called the Mecca of Contemporary Art. It is my great honour and pride to represent Bangladesh in the city. I will participate in it with a 55-minute Action Paintings Performance to celebrate ACC's 55th year,” said an elated Kalidas Karmakar over phone to The Daily Star. “I love doing action paintings while listening to traditional music of Bangladesh. This time, there was no exception. The proceeds will go to a philanthropic cause.” Kalidas Karmakar is one of Bangladesh's most recognised contemporary artists. Trained at what was then the East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (currently University of Dhaka's Faculty of Fine Art) and at the Government College of Arts and Crafts in Calcutta, he began his artistic journey in the early 1970s. His diverse body of work features found objects, handmade paper, oil on canvas prints and many more. They have been widely exhibited throughout South Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the United States. In 2006, he received an ACC Fellowship to participate in a residency at the PointB Worklodge in Brooklyn.

{"title": "Addressing colourism with art | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The Indian subcontinent's obsession with lighter skin is not unknown. In a world where the word 'fair' is often associated with the word 'lovely', a young artist from Dhaka came up with a rather telling artwork titled Dark and Lovely . A lot of people, who have been victims of colourism, could relate to the artwork - which is why it went viral on the internet. Waseka Nahar is the artist behind the piece, for whom art is an everlasting passion. Dark and Lovely , which was a collaboration with a Canada-based Pakistani artist Zainab Anwar, is a rendition of Zainab's self-portrait. Both of them have been featured on NDTV India. Waseka did not expect the artwork to receive such a huge response. However, she is glad to have reached out to a large audience. She believes that dark skin is as beautiful as its counterpart, and hopes that people will start having conversations about this often neglected topic. Apart from Dark and Lovely , Waseka has created brilliant artworks in the past, which she promotes on her Facebook page named 'Triory'. \"I don't always like having the spotlight on me,\" says Waseka, \"So I wanted to have a pen name. Triory is a character I built, that was loosely based on myself.\" Waseka wants to keep on making art both for herself and the society. \"I aspire to do my best by addressing social issues in my art,” adds Waseka.

{"title": "Art as a path of happiness in a violent world | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. From a young age, Morshed Mishu was an avid fan of comic books, so much so that he grew a knack for drawing comic-book characters, with the guidance of his brother. Apart from comic books, one of his biggest sources of inspiration for becoming a professional cartoonist was the popular satire magazine,Unmad. He has worked in many newspapers in various capacities and is currently an assistant editor at Unmad. Mishu's artworks have been featured in a total of 15 to 16 group exhibitions so far, including one in Berlin and another in London. In July 2018, at the 40-year celebrations of Unmad, the cartoonist was honoured with an award for The Global Happiness Challenge, his project that turns heartbreaking photographs into happy art. Mishu conceived the idea for the drawing challenge after coming across gruesome photographs of tragedies and wars on his social media feeds. “I found those photographs so jarring that I started having sleepless nights, and as a result, I would just ignore them,” says Mishu. “Then, I decided that I do not want to look at excruciating suffering. I want to see a world without violence, where everyone is happy, and that is how I was compelled to initiate the drawing challenge.” At the beginning of this year, Mishu started out by transforming the photograph of a tearful son, in the arms of his helpless father in a warzone, to an illustration of the same father and son laughing together in a beautiful field, surrounded by flowers and sunshine. Anik Khan, the executive editor of Unmad, is Mishu's mentor in this endeavour. He came up with the tagline – Ami shudhu aakte jaani,koshto gulo dhaakte jaani (I only know how to draw, how to cover the gloomy sorrow), for the project. The Global Happiness Challenge has seen a tremendous reception from different corners of the world. So far, it has garnered recognition in the media of Afghanistan, Albania, Bangladesh, France, India, Indonesia, Iran, Kurdistan, Turkey, and Vietnam. Popular internet media and news companies such as AJ+, Bored Panda and Buzzfeed have also featured the project. “The greatest achievement for me is when people tell me that they find my illustrations for The Global Happiness Challenge touching and thought-provoking,” asserts Mishu. Currently, The Global Happiness Challenge consists of nine artworks and Mishu hopes to produce 25 to 30 more. As his way of making a difference, he further aspires to host a solo exhibition on this project by next year in Bangladesh, and then take it beyond, to both war-ridden and developed nations. “This drawing challenge is not categorised by any country, borders, class, race, or religion. My aim is to spread the message of peace, positivity and happiness across the globe,” says Mishu, before taking a phone call from the Syrian media for yet another chat about his project.

{"title": "Curtains down: 46 cinema halls in Tangail closed down in 15 years | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. There were 51 cinema halls in Tangail in the 1990s. But only five managed to survive while 46 could not due to lack of audience. The owners still think it is possible to keep the business alive if movies with engaging stories and good production value are made and digitized cinema halls can be built with government assistance. The cinema hall business in Tangail started with Raushan Talkies built at a secluded corner of the then small municipal town in 1950 by Lebu Chawdhury. Following his footsteps, other movie halls opened in 12 upazilas. The number stood at 51 in the 1990s. But within just 10 to 15 years, 46 cinema halls closed down due to various problems such as lack of audience, movies with poor production value, and losses. Despite these crises, the owners of the five cinema halls -- one hall named Malancha in Tangail town, two in Nagarpur Sadar upazila, one in Madhupur Sadar upazila and one at Balla in Kalihati upazila -- have kept the dwindling business alive in the district. But they do not know how long they can continue. Inspired by Lebu Chowdhury, Montu Miah of the town's Dighulia area established the most attractive cinema hall of the town on Main Road in 1964. He named the hall Rupobani, the second theatre in the district. In 1973, Lebu Chowdhury, lifetime president of the hall owners' platform in the district, built his second cinema hall (third in the district) named Ruposhi on his own land at Battala in Tangail town. Later, he built three more cinema halls in Delduar, Mirzapur and Dhanbari upazilas. In 1975, Chhana Miah of Adalatpara built the fourth cinema hall Malancha in the middle of Adalatpara and Thanapara while Afzal Chowdhury of the same area constructed a hall named Keya the next year. Later, 46 more cinema halls were established at different places one by one till 1990s. The business was profitable till 2000. The halls used to screen five shows daily from 10:00am to 1:00am. There were five sitting arrangements inside the halls -- Front Stall, Stall, Real Stall, DC and Box. Moreover, a separate sitting arrangement was there for female audiences. The prices of tickets depended on which seat the audience chose for enjoying the movie. Following the booming business, cinema hall workers' union was formed in the district. Currently, Malancha holds four shows -- at 10:00am, 1:30pm, 4:30pm and 7:30pm -- with almost zero audience. There are three sperate arrangements for the audience -- Real Stall, DC and Box -- and the prices of the tickets are Tk 50, Tk 60 and Tk 70 respectively. During a recent visit to Malancha Cinema Hall, this correspondent found that the hall was showing the movie 'Rangbaj Badsha', featuring two actors from Tangail district -- Manna and Amit Hasan. The film has been rented at Tk 6,000 for seven days. Some former cinema hall workers said 46 cinema halls in the district were closed between 2001 and 2015. Jahangir Hossain, a tea stall owner in the town, said he used to watch movies every week. \"The stories of the movies and the actors, actresses at that time were good. I also used to re-watch some movies.\" \"But as the quality of movies started dropping… I have stopped going to the movie halls,\" he said. \"But, in future, if movies with quality stories and good artistes come, I'll go back to the cinema hall and watch the movie,\" he added. Jahid Hasan of Sabalia in the town said he stopped going to halls after the death of his favourite actor Manna and the demolition of cinema halls. Ganesh Chandra Sarkar, then director of Keya Cinema Hall and general secretary of the district cinema hall workers' union, said audiences are not going to the halls as they can watch any movie on mobile phones now. Dulal Chowdhury, son of late Lebu Chowdhury and the then owner of Raushan Talkies and Ruposhi cinema halls, said, \"After the death of my father in 2002, we had to shut the business due to huge losses.\" Raushan Talkies had to be closed in 2006 due to cancellation of land leased from Coronation Dramatic Club at Nirala intersection in the town. Ruposhi Cinema Hall was shut down in 2011 due to loss, Dulal added. Jahidur Rahman, who is running Malancha -- renting it from its owner -- said the journey of the cinema hall started in 1974 with the film \"Jighangsha\". Business was good then. Jahid said he has to spend at least Tk 2000 per month from his pocket to keep the hall open. But he does not know how long he will be able to run the business. \"I am still unable to pay the hall rent, electricity bill and staff salaries,\" Jahid said. But still they think that the business will turn around if the cinema halls are upgraded with modern technologies as well as good facilities with government support and if the audiences get quality movies.

After his exhibition at the first Bangkok Art Biennial, the New York based Bangladeshi artist Firoz Mahmud is back in the country with his solo exhibition titled Reverberation (Ouponibeshik/ Porouponibeshik ) which will be inaugurated today at Abinta Gallery of Fine Arts. The exhibition will run until November 10. In a conversation with The Daily Star , Firoz Mahmud shared information about his upcoming exhibition. Born in Khulna, the artist has always been in a prolonged journey of exploration through history, narratives, myth, and belief with his art. His styles include stencil techniques, oil painting on asymmetrical shaped canvases and large-scale Layapa Stencil paintings on paper and drawings. Through his work he tends to reanimate Bengal's historical past. For the art enthusiasts, his works project a lyrical storytelling. The traditional fables come to life through the use of vivid colours and abstract geometric formations. The artworks resonate not only the history but also the present socio-political sphere on a flat surface. The repetitive use of idioms of back stories —such as old palace, spice trees, forts, tigers and owls add elements to unfold the historical triumphs. He also revived historical figures from the British Raj-era, 1905's Partition of Bengal, East Pakistan Era and an independent Bangladesh with his own signature style. Mamhud says that he takes inspiration from narrative stencil painting created on doorway of clay hut and Japanese Ukiyo-e (woodblock print). Green is a predominant colour in most of his art work. He says, “Green is symbol of ecology. The colour also reminds me of my country and keeps me close to it.” His artworks have been exhibited at a number of international art Biennale and Triennial exhibitions including 1st Bangkok Art Biennale, 1st Lahore Biennial, Dhaka Art Summit, Setouchi Triennial (BDP), 1st Aichi Triennial, Sharjah Biennale, Busan Biennale, Asian Art Biennale, Cairo Biennale and Echigo-Tsumari Triennial in Japan. He bagged awards like Queens Council on Arts and Asian Cultural Council in New York; Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art; Monbukagakusho Japan Government and Dutch government Scholarship; Royal Over-seas League, UK; Arts Networks Asia Singapore; Deelnashin Khanam Gold Medal of Dhaka University and many more.

A solo art exhibition titled, Vinima in Bangladesh, was inaugurated recently at Britto Arts Trust in Green Road, Dhaka. The exhibition is showcasing artifacts by Indian sculptor Vinima Gulati. Britto Arts Trust is a non-profit artist’s collective, which was initiated in 2002. It has simplified a number of national and international large and small scale projects, exhibitions, seminars, residencies, and workshops with practitioners from home and abroad. Britto is a part of the worldwide triangle network. Vinima Gulati is an Indian sculptor who recently came to Bangladesh. Her artifacts at the exhibition are made of wool. She made many female chests (breasts) from wool, in various shapes, sizes, and colours. “In South Asia, the practice of seclusion and veiling of women is known as purdah. Women veil and seclude themselves before men, particularly in Pakistan, Northern India and Bangladesh. Veiling and seclusion are customs shared by both Hindus and Muslims in these zones, but they are used in each community for different social purposes,” explained Vinima. “Purdah, which literally means curtain, refers to the physical segregation of the living space, as well as the covering of the body and face. In this body of work, I collaborated with a group of women from lower income groups of Delhi to produce crochet works, which were produced in public spaces. But such subjects have a lot of privacy attached to them and are often considered taboo.” Through her work, Vinima aims to show that that breasts are just a part of the female body.

Aamir Khan’s Taree Zameen Par, in which the actor played an art teacher of a dyslexic kid Ishaan Awasthi, played by Darsheel Safari, is slated to be remade in Chinese. Khan made his directorial debut with this film in 2007. Taare Zameen Par was among the nine Indian films to be screened with English subtitles in China to mark the 60th anniversary of Indo-China diplomatic ties in 2010. According to reports, the film has not been officially released in China despite being one of the highest rated foreign films on a popular Chinese film site, Douban. It is also among the most pirated films playing in China. Aamir Khan’s other films like PK, Dangal and Secret Superstar were loved by Chinese audiences. There was an attempt to release the film in China with Mandarin subtitles like the other films. But China does not permit release of foreign films that are older than two years and so that could not be done. Since Taare Zameen Par rides on universal emotions, the decision of remaking it with a Chinese star cast was taken recently. The remake will be produced by a local banner and will be directed by Ma Duo, who has previously worked as an assistant director on the Jiang Wen classic, Let The Bullets Fly.

The attack resulted in more than twenty people getting injured and hospitalised. Deepika, however, did not address the crowd. She stood by as former JNUSU president, Kanhaiya Kumar, raised slogans and left just as current President Aishe Ghosh, who too was injured in the attack, began to speak. “When you are in a powerful position, you should speak up,” commented Ghosh. “There are many people in Bollywood who do not put forth their views. They are considered role models. I appeal to them: Make inspiring films after something has happened, but when you are in that position, talk about the story that is currently happening.” Recently, Deepika told a news channel that she feels proud that people have come out and raised their voice without fear, in reference to the protests against the amended Citizenship Act, the National Register of Citizens and the violence in JNU. “I feel proud to see that people are coming out -- be it on the streets or wherever they are -- they are raising their voices and expressing themselves, as it is important. If we want to see changes in our lives and the society, it is important to put our points of view forward,” she said.

It is unfortunate that you remember the teachings of your parents when they are not in your life,” Shah Rukh said in a statement. “Personally, I do feel the same, the small things that my father and mother said actually define me now, and I realise it now and I didn’t realise it then,” he said. The 53-year-old actor said he generally does not look for moral lessons in a film, but believes the story of Disney’s The Lion King is important because it talks about the precious bond between a parent and child. Directed by Jon Favreau, the filmmaker behind movies such as Iron Man and The Jungle Book . The Lion King is scheduled to be released on July 19 in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu languages. Shah Rukh, who along with his son Aryan will be voicing for King Mufasa and his son Simba, in the Hindi version of The Lion King believes one remembers the teachings of one’s parents only when they are gone. “Somewhere down the line, the story reflects that it is nicer to listen to your parents and understand the deeper meaning of what they are saying to you. It does teach you that our parents always live within us and their teachings never go away.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/bollywood/news/shah-rukh-khan-talks-parenting-1769998", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 314}

Superstar Shakib Khan is always on the go, and currently, the actor has a wide range of films in the offing. He is slated to play the lead role in award-winning director Kazi Hayat’s Bir, produced by SK Films. In a recent conversation with The Daily Star, Shakib Khan talks about his passion for films and more. Tell us a little about your forthcoming film, ‘Bir’. We just finished filming Bir, and we still have a lot to do. It is a special project not only because it is produced under my own production house, SK Films, but also because it is Kazi Hayat’s 50th film. People will get to see me in a completely new look in this venture. We aim to reach a wide audience with Bir, and we are all working very hard for the film. At a time when actors are struggling to find roles, you continue to make successful movies each year. As an artiste, what keeps you going? I feel blessed and humbled to be a working actor every day. I am eternally grateful to my fans, who continue to come to the theatres to watch my films. Their love and support are what keeps me going. Year after year, cinema theatres are going out of fashion and the number of films being produced in Bangladesh are decreasing. What are your comments on that? As an artiste, it is incredibly disheartening to see the deteriorating state of films in my own country. We need to work together as a fraternity to bring about positive changes in the industry. We also need to be more cautious about the quality of projects that we take up. Recently, rumours about you settling down in the USA popped up on social media. Is there any truth to these reports? Absolutely not! These are completely baseless rumours. I have built my whole life here, and I have no reason to move elsewhere. I belong to films, and I still have a lot to contribute to the industry.

The district’s administration, in collaboration with Suchitra Sen Smrity Shangrakhhan Parishad, have organised various programmes, commemorating the diva’s life and works. Born on April, 6 in 1931, Suchitra Sen grew up Gopalpur, in a small district town and started her academic journey with Mahakali Pathshala. She later pursued education from Pabna Govt Girls High School, where she studied until class-IX. Her family shifted India long before the liberation. “Suchitra Sen had no touch with Pabna since her departure from the ancestral house till death. However, she still lives in our hearts,” says Dr Noresh Chandra Modhu, Secretary of Suchitra Sen Smrity Shangrakhhan Parishad, Pabna.

The four-day long art festival, from March 27 - 30, came to an end yesterday with the opening of the grand exhibition of artworks by both prominent and promising artists, on themes ranging from nature to urbanisation, contemporary to classical, festivity to celebration of life and culture. Renowned Bangladeshi artists gathered at the unique event, amidst students of the Bhawal Mirzapur Haji Jamir Uddin School and College, which has created much buzz in the festival venue and surrounding community. The entire area was packed with locals on all four days. Apart from the artworks on display, handicrafts from all over the country were also exhibited at the Folk Art and Craft Fair. The art camp created an opportunity for both school students and budding artists from all across Bangladesh. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity for the young ones to augment their vision by closely interacting with such acclaimed artists. The exchange was deemed mutual as several noted artists said they also learned plenty from their peers. The students' artworks were reflective of the dark side of urbanisation in images of brickfields surrounding their schools, depictions of the deforestation that took place in the Sal forest in the area and the polluted black water in the river. Keeping with the festival's theme 'Beautiful Environment, Artistic Life', 15 contemporary artists also showcased their concerns revolving around environmental issues through their installations and mixed media works. All four evenings during the festival were graced with cultural programmes, which brought a breeze of relaxation after the tiring, day-long art camp sessions. Members of the Cultural and Programme Committee along with students serenaded the audience with a variety of music, dance, poetry and puppet shows. Dr Md Abu Hena Mostafa Kamal, NDC, Secretary of Ministry of Cultural Affairs, graced the inaugural ceremony of the exhibition as chief guest. Khurshid Alam, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Bangladesh; Dilruba Haider, Programme Specialist, UN Women Bangladesh; Anisuzzaman Chowdhury, Programme Manager, JICA Bangladesh; and, Begum Shamsunnahar, SP Gazipur was also present as special guests. The ceremony was chaired by Md Mohsin, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief. The convener, Professor Mohammad Eunus and the curator of the festival, Harun-ar-Rashid Tutul also spoke at the event. In stark contrast to the city-based, gallery-oriented art practice, this festival stands out in many aspects including its ability of community engagement, decentralising and diffusing art, and creating a humane generation by exposing people to their own artistic spirit. The festival was supported by The Daily Star, Channel i, UNDP, UN WOMEN, JICA, Asrotex Group, Max Group and Berger.

The third piece, a jugalbandi offering by all the artistes, was followed by solo pieces where Dasarath Das enthralled the audience with his Bangla dhol. Bickram, who had been accompanying Pandit Ravi Shankar for 12 years, captivated the audience producing a five-beat rhythm that was evocative of a train approaching and leaving a station. He also played several experimental pieces including generating rhythms on his chest and cheeks, with his hands. The audience also responded to his sawal-jawab styled claps. The troupe wrapped up the jugalbandi styled recital performing Ravi Shankar's piece from the Concert for Bangladesh, which was held at the Madison Square Garden, in USA during the Liberation War of Bangladesh. The kirtan inspired recital was embellished with a flute piece by Md Moniruzzaman. The performance, weaving together folk and classical melodies, truly left an impression on music lovers from both Dhaka and Kolkata as Bickram Ghosh predicted prior to the performance. Popular band Chandrabindu set off their performance with the songs Bhindeshi Tara, Bondhu Chol and Bondhu Tomaye E Gaan Shonabo.

{"title": "Birthday felicitations to Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Today marks the 104th birth anniversary of Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin, the founding father of Bangladeshi art and art education. Born in Mymensingh, Abedin grew up in the serene landscape by the river Brahmaputra. In 1933, he enrolled at Calcutta Government Art School, and later taught at the institute. He was an influential member of the Calcutta Group of progressive artists. Abedin was involved in the Liberation War movement. He was in the forefront of the cultural movement to re-establish the Bengali identity. In 1975, he set up a folk museum at Sonargaon, and a permanent gallery in Mymensingh known as the Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala. A celebrated figure for his leadership qualities in organising artists and art movements, Abedin, who passed away in 1976 in Dhaka, was the founding principal of the Government Institute of Arts and Crafts (now Faculty of Fine Art) in 1948 at University of Dhaka (DU). This institute trained and nurtured an entire generation of artists whose works reflected the changing times. Patua Qamrul Hassan, Shilpaguru Safiuddin Ahmed, Shafiqul Amin, Anwarul Haq were contemporaries of Zainul Abedin. This was the generation that depicted the changing social reality in their art. Abedin, who became well-known through his Famine Series Paintings of 1943, made his own ink by burning charcoal, using it on cheap ordinary packaging paper, he depicted the starving people. In his sketches, the great famine of Bengal showed its sinister face through the skeletal figures of people. Abedin depicted this inhuman story with human emotions. These sketches helped him find his way in a realistic approach that focused on human sufferings, struggles and protests. The Rebel Crow marks a high point of that style. “Abedin Sir's contribution to art and education through establishing Dhaka Art College are immense. I have many fond memories with him. Once, he went to my home district in Chandpur where we painted together on a boat around the confluence of the rivers -- Meghna, Padma and Dakatia,” recalls internationally acclaimed artist Monirul Islam, who with Susan Collins (UK) is set to receive Zainul Sammanona this morning, conferred by Faculty of Fine Art (FFA), DU. The DU Vice Chancellor Professor Md Akhtaruzzaman will hand over awards to the recipients. This year, FFA's 70th anniversary programme has been merged with the annual arrangement of Zainul Utshab that FFA has been organising since 2009. An exhibition featuring award-winning works at the annual exhibitions by the students of all the departments of FFA ends today. The best student will also receive Zainul Gold Medal at the programme. “We must go down memory lane to have a close look at our respective artistic efforts and contributions to judge what Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin did single-handedly for fine art, art education, and overall culture of this part of the world,” said Professor Nisar Hossain, Dean of FFA, DU. “We have to think of art education and culture with a sacrificing mind beyond mere personal interests and pursuits.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/news/birthday-felicitations-shilpacharya-zainul-abedin-1680067", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 540}

So, how the investment in this sector will return has to be decided in advance,” renowned Bangladeshi filmmaker and producer Abu Shahed Emon commented at an interactive conference, titled ‘West Meets East’ at Dhaka Club, recently. With the participation of local and international filmmakers, the conference was held as part of the 18th Dhaka International Film Festival 2020. The daylong event was attended by internationally acclaimed filmmakers Rubaiyet Hossain, Prosun Azad, Meenakshi Shedde, South Asia delegate of Berlin Film Festival and Suli, programmer of Busan Film Festival, among others. At the beginning of the conference, Meenakshi Shedde discussed the techniques of the selection of films for the festivals. Then, Abu Shahed Emon and other directors discussed the filmmaking, investment and its challenges. According to the discussants, international film festivals may vary according to regions. For example, some aspects are significant for the Europe film festival, which may not significant for Asian festivals and the focus point of American film festivals are different. So, before making a film, the filmmakers or affiliates have to decide where they will screen the film or in which festival it will be participating. They also have to be careful about selecting festivals. For an example, Meenakshi said, “Only the best films of the Busan Film Festival in Asia are the focus of the Cannes Film Festival”. Rainbow Film Society, one of the most active film entities in the film society movement of Bangladesh, has organised 18th Dhaka International Film Festival’ with the motto ‘Better Film, Better Audience and Better Society’. 220 films from around 74 countries are being screened under different categories at the event, which concludes on January 19.

Her eventful life is the script.” Radwan Mujib Siddiq, grandson of Bangabandhu, made the comment during the rescreening of Hasina: A Daughter’s Tale in the capital’s Lit Festival recently. The stories of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, narrated in her voice, captivated the auditorium full of foreign poets and litterateurs. Reflecting on the journey spanning five years behind the documentary film, he said, “When she (Sheikh Hasina) asked for the script before the creation of this docudrama, I told her that there was no script. She is the story herself. Her eventful life was the script.” The visual, starring Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, tells the stories of her life of as the daughter of Bangabandhu, the man inspiring an entire nation to become sovereign, after one of the worst genocides of the world. “While most historical docudramas in our country are ‘officious’ in tone, Hasina: A Daughter’s Tale stands out in its narrative,” said Radwan. The film focuses on storytelling, bringing in engaging stories that would otherwise remain unheard of. “The director’s camera even made its way to her kitchen and library too,” he added. Talking effusively on the contribution of Bangabandhu and his family, Piplu Khan, director of the documentary film, said, “They are the inception. They are responsible for the air of freedom we breathe in, and their life is as dramatic as any movie.” We see through the eyes of the Prime Minister herself, how the occupation forces captured Bangabandhu, leaving the faintest hope if he would ever be able to return. When the scene depicting her getting a phone call from the other end of the world was shown, saying that her entire family was assassinated, the audience could feel chills. The night of August 15 in 1975 ushered in the darkest chapter of our history, when Bangabandhu, along with his entire family was killed at his residence in the capital’s Dhanmondi. Sheikh Hasina’s life, in all the twists and turns, snippets and vignettes, her journey as the daughter of the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, came alive on screen. It took five years of effort to get the visual narrative on screen. Down the memory lane, down the trail left by the Father of the Nation, and anywhere a story was waiting to be heard, the crew has pulled out all the stops to bring it on screen, and it is safe to say that the effort was fruitful.

Notre Dame University Bangladesh (NDUB) hosted Boishakhi Mela 1426 recently at their campus.

Members of the NDUB family then hoisted the national flag and sung the national anthem. Students began the cultural programme with the song Esho He Boishakh. Faculty members Sourav Palma and Tama Chowdhury Tuli accompanied them on the tabla and harmonium respectively. After a series of musical and dance performances by the students, a Loko Sangeet concert was arranged, where Eliza Putul entertained everyone with folk songs like Tak Dum Tak Dum Bajai Bangladesher Dhol, Tomai Hridmazar E Rakhbo, and Chere de Nouka Ami Jabo Madina. Chisty Baul also charmed the audience with his melodious voice. The students of the Department of English at NDUB staged William Shakespeare’s comedy A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the evening.

Nrityanchal has been one of the leading dance companies in Bangladesh for over a decade. To celebrate their success in the dance firmament, the troupe organised a three-day festival, Nrityanchal Utshab 2016, from April 27-29, which happens to be International Dance Day. The curtains were raised on the first night of the festival with a set 'Kathak Sandhya' at the National Theatre Hall Auditorium of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA), to a soulful guru vandana, presented by what seemed like an incalculable swarm of dancers adorned in serene blue and white costumes. The vandana was followed by a welcome speech presented by the directors of the festival and co-founders of Nrityanchal, Shibli Mohammad and Shameem Ara Nipa. They were joined on stage by the coordinator of Nrityanchal, Muhammad Jahangir, as well as the chief guest for the evening, Bharatanatyam virtuoso Leela Samson and special guest, artist Mustafa Manwar. Subsequently, the director duo paid homage to Gurumata Rahija Khanam Jhunu for her countless contributions to dance over the years. [gallery id=\"1216186\"][/gallery] The first performance of the Kathak Sandhya was a pure classical segment, presented by a group of eight senior students of Nrityanchal, covering tukra, tehai, paran, amad, gat nikas and lari amongst others on teentaal, accompanied by live musicians. Following this, a solo thumri was performed by Monira Parveen Happy, which personified Radha-Krishna's activities during a Holi festival. The show progressed with a number of pure classical pieces including a tarana and a gat bhao named \"Makhan Chor\". Next, the performers presented a rather unique routine combining several Bollywood dance items, which were originally Kathak choreographies, taken from movies ranging from \"Mughal-E-Azam\" to \"Bajirao Mastani\". The last performance, entitled \"Pathshala\", brought to stage 200 students of Nrityanchal performing fragments of Kathak, such as tukra and tehai, in subdivided groups. The evening concluded with the two directors joining the students on stage for a footwork finale. Kathak Sandhya was choreographed by Shibli Mohammad and dedicated to his guru, Kathak legend Pandit Birju Maharaj. On the second day of the festival, Srishti Cultural Center, in collaboration with Nrityanchal, staged their production \"Badi Bandar Roopkotha\", which is based on the story \"Alibaba O Chollish Chor\". The final set of the festival will be performed today by underprivileged children as well as children with special needs at the Nandan Mancha of BSA.

Pohela Boishakh, the largest festival in Bangladesh, is just around the corner. Mangal Shobhajatra, an integral part of the celebration, is also widely anticipated by all. Recognised as the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2016, the vibrant and colourful procession is graced by tens of thousands of people from all walks of life. The Faculty of Fine Art (FFA), popularly known as Charukala, University of Dhaka (DU), has kept the Mangal Shobhajatra free of commercial patronship. Instead, the teachers, students and the alumni of FFA raise funds by selling artworks, sora (items made with clay), masks and crafts which they create themselves. This year, the motto for the Mangal Shobhajatra is Mostok Tulite Dao Ananta Akashe, an excerpt from Tagore's poem Traan, which roughly translates to Rising Above. The rally will start at 9 am from FFA premises, according to Professor Nisar Hossain, Dean of FFA, DU. In 1989, the students organised a colourful procession titled “Mangal Shobhajatra” -- literally translating to wellbeing procession -- on Pohela Boishakh. Since then, the students and teachers of Charukala have held on to the tradition. Every year, the procession centres on a theme relevant to the country's culture and politics. “We always think of the country's cultural heritage along with the ongoing socio-political situation to determine the theme,” says Nisar Hossain. “As artists, we also uphold our artistic heritage identifying with Bangladesh – mainly the folk heritage.” Like every year, the Mangal Shobhajatra this year will feature various animal-shaped carnival floats, large colourful masks, replicas of birds, butterflies, traditional dolls and other motifs of Bangladesh. The 21st batch of FFA students are in charge of organising Mangal Shobhajatra this year.

A modern and hectic lifestyle leaves minimal scope for recuperating from several adverse effects. We do not get enough time for natural healing, and the consequences of pollution, stress, and sleep deprivation linger on. Looking for swift remedies, many of us end up using products that often expose us to potential harm and side effects. To solve the plight of beauty problems caused by a modern lifestyle, we need to rely on the basics of natural healing. 5000 years of wisdom from Ayurveda carries the knowledge of herbs and ingredients with natural healing components. Bearing that in mind, Unilever Bangladesh nationally launched Lever Ayush – a range of products made using the most potent ingredients that are highly beneficial to the skin, hair and teeth. These products are designed to solve issues like premature ageing, facial acne, hormonal spots and headaches, leading people to a stress-free life. To introduce the products, Unilever Bangladesh hosted a launch event, attended by Lever Ayush's brand ambassador actor Mehazabien Chowdhury, social media influencers, media representatives and others. The event was held at Four Points by Sheraton yesterday. The objectives of the event were to identify modern-day beauty problems and the need of natural remedies to cater to diverse beauty needs, convey the power of Ayurveda and natural ingredients along with their efficacy as a trustworthy solution to lifestyle problems and discuss the role of Ayurveda in people's mental and physical wellbeing. Mehazabien gave a keynote speech and unveiled Lever Ayush at the event.\"There are not many brands in Bangladesh that provide a range of cosmetics based on natural ingredients. But Lever Ayush is one such brand that I have personally used and only then decided to be a brand ambassador of,” said Mehazabein. A range of shampoos, tooth pastes, face creams, face washes and soaps were launched during the event. The audience was invited to the terrace to have a look at the natural ingredients used for the products, which were on display. Lever Ayush plans to introduce more products in the near future. The evening came to an end with a musical soiree.

This year, the festival ran from October 10-21 with visits from several renowned directors and famous Hollywood superstars. Now, in its 62nd year, LFF screened 225 feature length films from 75 different countries encompassing a variety of films from different genres and styles. LFF has several different strands for selecting films, which makes the festival very comprehensive. The festival often tends to foreshadow which films will do well in the upcoming award season as well. Most of the screenings take place at the British Film Institute (BFI) itself, or at state-of-the-art cinemas in West End. The biggest attraction among the venues, however, is undeniably the Embankment Garden Cinema. A minute's walk from Charing Cross and overlooking the Thames is Victoria Embankment Gardens. This tranquil lush green park, designed by the Duke of Buckingham in 1626, turns into one of the most picturesque venues of the festival. The park, for 12 days, flawlessly transforms into a stunning modern cinema with seating of 800, 4K projection and 7.1 Dolby Surround Sound. The experience was mind-boggling. One of the highlights at the festival was the UK premier of the Coen Brothers' new film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs . The film, produced by Netflix, is an anthology of 6 stories set in the Wild West. Although it does not live up to their previous films such as Fargo or No Country For Old Men, there were two chapters (All Gold Canyon and The Gal Who Got Rattled) which are worth mentioning. Each year, the LFF awards the best film of the official competition strand and this year the award went to Austrian film Joy. Directed by Sudabeh Mortezai, the story deals with two important topics in today's world – prostitution and sex trafficking. However, my personal three favourite films were not in official competition and they are (in no particular order) Roma, Dogman , and Three Faces . Although standing in queues for close to an hour for delegate tickets for each film can be a little taxing, it is also a very good opportunity to meet some of the other delegates who were attending the festival. LFF lures film lovers from all over the world, some of whom travel to London specifically for the festival. This is why certain films like Yorgos Lanthimos' The Favourite and, director Barry Jenkin's If Beale Street Could Talk was impossible to get into for most of the delegates, myself included. As the curtain went down at LFF, I could not help but feel a little empty. A rollicking 12 days of watching remarkable films and meeting people from all over the world came to an end. I was however saddened that no Bangladeshi film was selected this year as I would have looked forward to that the most. But with the quality of Bangladeshi films improving every year, there is enough reason to believe that one day Bangladesh can be regular participants at prestigious festivals such as this one.

Opening the final evening of performances at the Dhaka International Folk Fest 2018 was one of the up and coming Bangladeshi folk bands, Nakshikatha. The band started off by playing a pulsating beat coupled with a great bandana , eulogising the eminent mystic bards and the opulent cultural heritage of Bangladesh. They boastfully rendered the gems we have in our national treasure trove. A mellow folk guitar piece certainly embellished the band's second performance of a Bhawaiya song inspired by the allusion of eternal love between Radha and Krishna. The following song on their set list was an Abbasuddin classic, O Ki O Bondhu Kajol Bhromora Re – a song that depicts the everlasting appeal of a pining heart. We truly missed Shadhin Bangla Betar Kendra artiste Rathindranath Roy's rendition of the song while Nakshikatha performed the timeless classic on stage.

{"title": "Nandita Das gets candid about 'Manto' at DLF 2018 | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Actor-director Nandita Das's Manto, the film that took a bow in the Cannes' Un Certain Regard section this year, was screened in the AKSB auditorium on Thursday afternoon at the Dhaka Lit Fest (DLF) 2018. Inspired by the life and writings of the Indian-Pakistani writer of the 20th century, Saadat Hasan Manto, the film has been well-received at both festivals and theatres. It is the second feature film by Das, who is known for her well-sketched portrayals of politically conscious stories. Her first film as a director was Firaaq (2008), which was set one month after the 2002 violence in Gujarat, India. Manto portrays the four crucial years of the Muslim writer's life from 1946 to 1950. The timeline is also significant because it follows the Indian independence from the British rule and the Partition of India and Pakistan, which resulted in the killing of over a million in religious riots and displacement of about 14 million Hindus and Muslims of the country. Manto was heavily depressed and perplexed by the situation. Many of Manto's violent stories sprang from the horrors he witnessed during the Partition. The film also sets the background to his heart wrenching decision to leave his beloved Bombay and move to Pakistan. After the screening, in the director's cut session with Annie Zaidi, Das shared some insights of the film and her hopes. She used the term “Mantoiyat” which was coined by Manto himself in one of his essays. “Through the film I intend to spread Mantoiyat, which means to have the will to be more honest, courageous and free spirited,” she expressed. “It also gave me an opportunity to respond to what is happening around us.” She also spoke about the casting process for the film. Noted actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who plays Manto, resembled the writer astoundingly on screen. Das revealed that she chose Siddiqui because his eyes matches those of Manto. She also said that it was quite a challenge to cast the right person for the role of Manto's wife, Safia, before the team came across actor Rasika Dugal, who she feels gave a brilliant performance. The intertwining of the writer's biography and his creations along with Das's finesse as a director came through beautifully in the film. According to Das, it was important to add the stories of Manto in the film so as to bring out the man behind it. However, many fans of Manto have commented that the film is far from the gruesomeness portrayed in his writings. Dhaka is the first city to have a public screening of Manto.

Nrityanchal, one of the most renowned dance companies of the country, recently staged the dance drama, Meera, based on the life of Meera Bai, at the National Theatre Hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. As soon as the narration began in the background, dancers of Nrityanchal took their positions on the stage. The entire stage lit up the moment they began dancing, in wonderful syncronisation. A total of fifty artistes from Nrityanchal performed at the show. Their energy was quite contagious. Prominent dancer Shibli Mohammad played the role of Ayan Ghosh and Shamrat Akbar. He portrayed both a suspicious husband to Radha, and Akbar's strong personality, effortlessly. With her breathtaking beauty and flexibility, Shamim Ara Nipa gave a memorable performance as the graceful Radha. The celebrated character of the evening, Meera, a reincarnation of Radha, was played by famous artiste Kajol Ibrahim. From entering the stage donning a peach-coloured attire, till the very end, she captivated the audience with her elegant moves. Throughout the performance, Krishna played an essential role, which was played by Sukalyan Bhattacharya, from Kolkata, who also directed the show. The costumes, combined with the remarkable lighting, added grandeur to the performance. The theatrical music, timid lights and props created an exceptional environment of the woods on stage, during the scene when Ayan sees Radha and Krishna together.

Operation X, a tale of the War of Liberation was launched in Bangla at an event today. Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haq was present at the chief guest while LGRD State Minister Swapan Bhattacharjee attented the launching ceremony as special guest at the Westin Hotel today, according to a press release from the High Commission of India in Dhaka. Operation X, co-written by Indian Capt MNR Samant and noted author and journalist Sandeep Unnithan, tells how commando operations, jointly undertaken by the Mukti Bahini and Indian Navy took place during the Liberation War in 1971. The Operation was conceptualised by the then Indian Navy chief Admiral SM Nanda and Captain (later Vice Admiral) Mihir K Roy and was executed by Capt MNR Samant. Over 450 naval commandos were trained and infiltrated into erstwhile East Pakistan to disrupt the Pakistani military and logistics lines of supply by destroying watercraft, jetties, and marine infrastructure so that Pakistani forces could not resupply themselves, which ultimately led to their swift capitulation in 13 days of War, said the release. Along with commando operations, the book also talked about the raid on Mongla port by gunboats Padma and Polash, the two gunboats provided by the Indian Navy with a mixed Bangladeshi and Indian crew. The Naval Commando Operation X or NCO(X) was part of \"Operation Jackpot\", which entailed covert training and equipping of the Mukti Bahini. Overall, between August and November 1971, the commandos sank/disabled 100,000 tonnes of enemy shipping and completely blocked the ports of East Pakistan, added the release. In sheer scale, this was the largest covert operation undertaken anywhere in the world after World War II. The story, which remained untold for 48 years, was first released in English in 2019. It has been compiled from personal notes of Capt MNR Samant and firsthand accounts of Indian Naval Personnel and Muktijuddhas who participated in the operations.

{"title": "Paeans to Muhammad Jahangir | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The entire lobby, entrance and the front stage of the National Theatre Hall, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy was enlivened with the portraits of renowned journalist, writer and cultural personality, Muhammad Jahangir. The adorned bouquets and lighted candles circling the portraits evoked the physical absence of the media personality, but the soulful words and emotive expressions on Muhammad Jahangir by the eminent personalities repeatedly affirmed the vivacious presence of the deceased, who is still alive in his great deeds. It was a truly befitting programme that was arranged to pay homage to Muhammad Jahangir, who was the chief coordinator of Nrityanchal, and took the dance organisation to a great heights. A number of Nrityanchal artistes soulfully dance to the Tagore song Tumi Robey Nirobey in remembrance of the beloved personality. Nrityanchal director duo Shibli Muhammad and Shameem Ara Nipa expressively revisited the fond memories of Muhammad Jahangir and called the country’s towering cultural personalities on stage to pay their tributes to the media personality. “Muhammad Jahangir was junior to me. When my affectionate younger ones pass away, I feel a sense of guilt in my heart. Back in 1969, I met Jahangir in Chittagong and I wrote a letter to Professor Munier Chowdhury, the then Chairman of the Department of Bangla, University of Dhaka. Jahangir’s scholarly acts and creativity found a congenial atmosphere to flourish, when he was admitted to the department,” said National Professor Anisuzzaman. “His success as a journalist is beyond question. He wrote many books on mass media and contemporary social issues. Jahangir would deeply think on society and culture. He had great love and emotion for art forms, including theatre and dance. We will uphold the love that Jahangir felt for art. He will be permanently embedded in our hearts.” Renowned thespian Ramendu Majumdar said, “Once I said to Jahangir that if someone publishes a memorial book on me after my death, then you will, of course, edit the book. Alas! I am now to speak on him in his memorial programme!” “Muhammad Jahangir was a man of soul. Prior to Nrityanchal, he was involved with us regarding organising an international film festival, named the Film for Friendship. Not only had that he brought out a fantastic souvenir for the festival. He knew how to appreciate positivity. He would inspire me to write. When one of my write-ups on the Boston International Film festival was published in Prothom Alo, he praised me immensely. Jahangir bhai had a great thirst for diverse knowledge. Wherever he is, I pray to the Almighty, to keep him in eternal peace,” said legendary actor Sarah Begum Kabori. Renowned thespian Ataur Rahman said, “Birth is a matter of celebration for every person. I think, death, in a sense, is a matter of celebration as well. I would like to celebrate Jahangir’s good deeds that he has left for us.” Eminent artist and cultural personality, Mustafa Monwar echoed the same spirit that Ataur Rahman expressed. He quoted Rabindranath Tagore and hinted that soil can eat up a person’s physique, but it cannot swallow up a person’s creativity. “Muhammad Jahangir will be ever remembered and alive in his good deeds,” said Mustafa Monwar. Eminent singer Sadi Muhammad was at an emotive loss, and could not utter any words in his tribute. He paid a musical tribute to the great personality, rendering a choral Tagore song Tomar Ashim-e along with his fellow singers of Rabirag. Professor Abdullah Abu Sayeed, founder of Bishwa Sahitya Kendra, Mamunur Rashid, renowned theatre personality, and one of Muhammad Jahangir’s friends, Chinmoy Mutsuddi shared their fond memories on him. Later, the family members of Muhammad Jahangir took the stage and the deceased’s sibling Muhammad Ibrahim and Rehana Akhter, wife of Muhammad Jahangir, spoke at the programme. The soulful rendition of songs, together with dance presentations by the artistes of Nrityachal, kept the magnanimity of the programme till the very end. Dance presentation with the Tagore song Jokhon Porbe Na Mor Payer Chinho wrapped up the wonderful memorial programme.

It is a wonderful experience for all the participating artists, artisans, cultural activists, journalists, students and the local inhabitants to participate in the Art Festival 2019, Gazipur. The festival, with the theme, 'Beautiful Environment, Artistic Life', has already gained momentum with the proactive participation of the country's prominent and promising artists. “Selecting subjects to depict on canvas by the artists is an important aspect that I always enjoy while taking part in an art camp. Artists are portraying works keeping environmental concerns in mind. I depicted crows and goats on canvases,” said Rafiqun Nabi. “Beautiful environment and congenial artistic atmosphere ensure a plethora of creations. Considering the matter, this festival is uniquely different.” Renowned artist Professor Mohammad Eunus, also the convener of the festival, portrayed a butterfly. The wings of the butterfly are marked with the impression of bricks. The contemporary presentation of the work symbolically evokes the rampant urbanization demolishing the greenery and the biodiversity all around. Folk heritage, contemporary socio-political aspects, landscape and elements of nature like fish and birds are the prominent depictions by renowned artists AbdusShakoor Shah, Hamiduzzaman Khan, NisarHossain, Shishir Bhattacharya, Farida Zaman, Ahmed Shamsuddoha, Sheikh AfzalHossain and AfrozaaJamilKonka. Promising artist BishwajitGoswami allegorically portrayed feminine portraits to represent Mother Nature. Using vibrant colours and multifarious forms, artist Mohammad Iqbal and Anupam Huda depicted abstract imageries that are the reverberation of the decay of the environment. A special contemporary art project titled, Edge of Existence, is simultaneously going on at the festival venue where 15 talented artists are making and displaying arts independently with an exclusive focus on environmental issues. Promising artists from public and private universities are creating extraordinary artworks as they are interacting with people and are in a close proximity with nature. Artworks by the school students are no less important than the ones depicted by the promising artists. They have taken making art as a matter of joy and not as tiresome academic pursuits. Participation of the people from all walks of life has enlivened the spirit of the event. Many renowned artists are proposing to make the art festival an international one where artists from all over the world can participate to decentralise art locally. A grand exhibition opens today at 3pm at the festival venue Bhawal Mirzapur Haji Jamir Uddin School and College with a number of artworks produced in the art camp by several hundred artists from all over Bangladesh. Folk art and craft fair along with vibrant cultural programmes are happening everyday at the festival.

As a cover artist, Tirtho attempts to not give any spoilers to the readers. “I generally read the scripts before designing a cover. When I design, I leave a few things to the readers' interpretation,” says Tirtho. “There will be no fun, if a reader can predict the story just by looking at the cover.” However, he makes sure the cover is relevant to the story of the book. Among the different genres of books, he finds it difficult to design covers for children's books, since their psychology works differently than most adults. He mainly uses the digital medium. Tirtho has few more covers on his plate for the Boi Mela, that he is currently working on, and he hopes that the fair stays well-organised this year.

To celebrate the end of the winter days and to gear up for spring with festivities, Dhaka saw two weekend fairs taking place in different corners of the city. Many people flocked to Dhanmondi's Drik Gallery to attend 'Pousher Pala', while in Niketon, 'Go Deshi', an initiative to support and promote locally produced crafts and goods attracted large crowds. Pousher Pala was organised by Shorodindo, a youth-centric clothing boutique. The founder and designer is a BFA graduate in Graphic Design from the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka.

Other than that, most of the participating vendors and boutiques were also youth initiatives with many of them having their first show in the physical sphere. Nivanna, a photography agency showcased some of their works featuring brides on their wedding day, family groups and portraits which were framed and hung all around the gallery. The organisers also mentioned that their purpose was not only to sell products but also to create a culturally stimulated space. Live baul music was performed by Nur Alam Siddiki, and live portrait sketching and caricature drawing sessions were also done by art students. There were some food stalls that sold homemade items from the Adibashi cuisine. At Niketon, Go Deshi offered homemade pickles made from a variety of fruits and vegetables, organic soaps and pure spices with their natural oils preserved such as turmeric and chilli. New mothers shopped for their children from Nerdy Smarty which had popular Bangla phrases, such as Aha Ki Anondo and Fagun Haway Haway printed on their rompers. Overall, Dhakaites had more than a few events to spend their leisure time in an atmosphere of festivity on the weekends. Fairs such as Pousher Pala and Go Deshi bring people together in a family friendly atmosphere and remind them to cherish the local traditions. It is also refreshing to see the youth of the country dedicate efforts to retain the heritage of Bangladesh.

According to Sydney Levin, there often seems to be a misunderstanding amongst filmmakers that, in order for a film to be successful in the international market, it must comprise of a stellar cast. In fact, what is more vital is for the script to convey a message that is relatable. She says that what we finally see on the screen is what matters the most. Along with the newcomers, multiple celebrated local filmmakers were also amongst the speakers at this year's DIFF. During his address, Tauquir Ahmed mentioned that one of the prime factors that imposed a restriction on the quality of local films is the budget. Comparatively, the Western films tend to be more appealing to the audience due to the hefty budget allocated for the making. Mostofa Sarwar Farooki said that filmmakers should be selective about their stories. He emphasised on the necessity to identify the content accurately and also to formulate stories based on an international context. According to young producer Abu Shahed, Netflix is scooping a large sum of money from the Bangladeshi subscribers, despite having no investment locally. He hoped that the company would soon invest and assist the local film community to flourish. The event concluded with a thank you note from filmmaker Samia Zaman.

The Kathmandu Killers, from Nepal, lifted everyone's mood in the beginning with their punk rock songs. Armeen's project, The Ghaashphoring Choir, then enchanted the crowd with their fusion-filled renditions of popular Bangla tracks. F Minor, an all-girl band from the hill tracts, singer Sovvota and folk singer Baby Akhter, were equally impressive throughout the entire show.

An exclusive group art exhibition titled 17, by modern and contemporary artists of Bangladesh, began yesterday at Galleri Kaya in Uttara. Eminent artist, Professor Murtaja Baseer, inaugurated the event as the chief guest. The exhibition is showcasing a selection of 48 artworks by 17 artists. The paintings are done in oil, acrylic, indigenous pigment, watercolour, ink, charcoal, pastel, pencil, on paper and canvas. Aminul Islam, who passed away in 2011, was a leading member of the pioneering modern art movement in Bangladesh. His oil painting, Rhythm of Forgotten Music-1, is on display at the gallery. A man of many talents, Murtaja Baseer, has established himself as one of the top artists in Bangladesh over the years. Throughout his illustrious career, Baseer, who is also a poet, writer, novelist, researcher and numismatist, has gradually transformed his working style from realism and semi-realism to abstract realism. The artist’s folk-themed oil pastel work, Woman-4, stands out at the exhibition. Baseer is also passionate about filmmaking. Renowned artist Qayyum Chowdhury is exhibiting his work of nature and folk-inspired landscapes at the event. He was instrumental in establishing the art scene of Bangladesh, as we know it today. Samarjit Roy Choudhury is a famous name in the country’s art sector. His unique approach to developing a visual dialogue between simplified, nearly abstract language and motifs from the country’s rural and traditional roots, is one of the most notable features of his work. Several works by the artist, including Opera Stars, are on display at the show. Prolific painter Hashem Khan’s artwork of mystic bards and birds of Bangladesh, are being showcased at the exhibition. Rafiqun Nabi promotes the practice of contemporary art in the country. Known for his woodworks, acrylic paintings, watercolour works, and his cartoon character, ‘Tokai’, Nabi is widely revered in Bangladesh. He is largely responsible for taking Bangladeshi art to international platforms. His famous mixed media work, Tokai, along with the watercolour pieces, Rocks and Goats, are displayed at the event. Sculptor and painter Hamiduzzaman Khan’s watercolour works have earned him accolades across the world. Known for his amiable personality, Khan shuns the thought of confining himself to a single medium, always experimenting with different styles. His brilliant bird’s-eye-view watercolour pieces of the 60s are also on display, alongside Kalidas Karmakar’s unique composition, The Lady and the Bird. Vibrant hues, aesthetic composition, and diverse yet meticulous forms are the striking features of Chandra Shekhar Dey’s Waiting in Autumn. On the other hand, one of the leading artists of Bangladesh, Mohammad Eunus, has poetically depicted visual beauty in his abstract paintings. Jamal Ahmed’s mixed-media work, Before the Storm, is also one of the most stunning displays at the event. Kazi Rakib and Ranjit Das’s work also impressed at the exhibition. Ahmed Shamsuddoha’s depiction of natural landscapes in Golden Bengal evokes serenity. Portrait artist Sheikh Afzal Hossain’s work is pleasing to the eyes, especially his portrayal of aphrodaisiac women. Shishir Bhattacharjee’s signature drawings, accompanied by one with a majestic view of the mountains, was meticulous. Mohammad Iqbal showcased the innocence of underprivileged children for the show.

The photographs mainly highlighted the role of bravery portrayed by the women and students during the time frame. The principal mentioned, “These photos stand as a testament to the horrendous genocide that we faced. It will help the younger generation to learn about the sufferings and in turn, spark the essence of patriotism.” Nadim Mahmud, president of the Chatra Union of Bogura district unit said, “We have arranged a total of 100 rare photographs, related to the partition of India and Pakistan, the Language Movement, forming of Jukta Front, education movement of 62, the six point movement, history of mass upsurge in 69, and the Liberation War of 1971.” Aimed at the youth, it provided a perceptive about our history of oppression as a people, and how we fought and emerged as a victorious nation.

{"title": "Abdul Gaffar Babu's 'Pixel of Emotion' at AFD | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Artist Abdul Gaffar Babu's third solo exhibition, titled Pixel of Emotion , is currently taking place at Allaince Française de Dhaka (AFD). The artist is an MFA graduate in Printmaking from the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. Gaffar's artworks may be categorised as psychedelic, surreal and op-art. It is interesting to observe elements of the contemporary art evolution that is taking place in the western world, and elsewhere in Gaffar's body of work. For a long time, Bangladeshi artists have been inclined to stay within the traditional realms of making art, which gave rise to an art culture that is distinct and separate from the rest of the world. Nowadays however, many new and upcoming artists dare to stray away from the conservative modes of creating art and delving into a much more exciting and experimental process. This is inspiring for the artists as well as the art lovers who crave to see the broadening of the art sphere in Bangladesh. Many of the subjects in Gaffar's art are common in still-life paintings. Yet, he has chosen to take those subjects and paint them in his own style of geometric patterns and line art, which he tweaks to create illusions as well as portray shape, depth and form. It is also apparent that the artist is affected by many of the social and moral issues of being a citizen in today's world. Some artworks which depict his reflections of modern society include a drawing of a man's head within which lies a lock and many keys, none of which seem to be the one to open the lock. Another painting shows wild animals baring their sharp teeth encircling a human. A particularly moving painting is one that seems to be a mesh of his signature checkered pattern, but upon close observation, reveals a bird wearing a gas mask. Gaffar's use of colour is clever, subtle and effective. On many occasions, he turns to somber hues of brown and grey, black and white. His style and subjects alone create a striking enough effect and forces the viewer to stop and stare. The artist believes that it is his duty to show something new with every solo exhibition. He has developed this body of work over five years. He included installations made out of a curtain of beads which incorporate black and white to spell out the words, 'Peace' and 'Love'. He believes that much of what we see around us is inevitably filtered through our emotions. The exhibition will run till February 22.

{"title": "Alia Kamal's 'Excerpts' under way at Jatra Biroti | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Painting is one field that has become a popular calling to many. While Charukola is throbbing with young students from different walks of life, some aspiring painters are taking private classes, while others are teaching themselves. Alia Kamal is one such painter who recognised her passion early on in life and has been working on improving ever since. Organised at Jatra Biroti, Excerpts, Alia's first solo exhibition, is a brilliant showcase of her oil paintings. Her works portray fragments of entire lives - intimate moments, perhaps in the mundane or perhaps in silent crises. “I try and paint from my distinct gaze of being a Bangladeshi woman struggling to find her identity in the chaos of Dhaka,” says Alia. “My artistic philosophy aligns with the thoughts of artist Hannah Wilke who said that women should “universalise” the “personal” and make it the subject of their art.” Alia dedicated herself to art while working at the BRAC Institute of Educational Development. Soon, she left her job to be a full-time artist. For Alia, it was a gamble that worked out. She recently spent about five months in Nepal teaching and practicing art, where she felt that her art-making became really organic. Before the trip, she felt that her hands were very restricted and she neither felt fully confident about her technique nor was she collected about her vision of her work. “My time in Nepal was very restorative and gave me some much-needed practice and perspective,” she explains. “By the end of it, I was itching to get back into the studio and tackle some new challenges. Once I started working and the paintings grew, I felt finally ready to gather the courage and try for my solo exhibition.” Although at first it was terrifying, Alia's friends and family really supported her and she has not looked back since. Her works were previously featured at the Dhaka Arts Center, TedxDhaka, Longitude Latitude 6, Mad Koffee 2.0 and the Milkshake Collective. In the near future, Alia hopes to seek more training in drawing and painting in an atelier art studio. The opening reception of Excerpts was held on November 10, with a classical music performance of flute by Musarrat Jabeen Rahman. The exhibition will continue till November 24.

Md Anisul Haque is a promising artist, and is also a Masters of Fine Art (MFA) student of the Department of Ceramic, Nanjing University of the Arts (NUA), China. He held his first solo ceramic sculpture exhibition at the School of Design Art Gallery of the university. The inaugural ceremony of the exhibition took place on January 6 and will conclude today. The exhibition, titled Unfortunate Aspect of Humanity , was inaugurated by Dr Yu Rui, Deputy Director of NUA. Jiang Jie, Dean of School of Design, NUA, Cao Bufeng, Dean of School of International Education, NUA and Lu Bin, Professor of Ceramic Department, NUA were present among others as honourable guests. Coreen Abbott, renowned ceramic artist of San Francisco, California, USA attended the ceremony as special guest. The exhibition sheds light on the unfortunate aspects of humanity, caused by wars. “I don't know what happened in Nanjing during the Second World War, but I felt pathetic when I visited Nanjing Massacre Museum,” said Anisul Haque. “I also came to realise what happened in Bangladesh in 1971 and what's currently happening in Myanmar, Syria, Yemen and so forth.” Generally, a refugee is a displaced person who has been forced to cross national boundaries, unable to return home safely. They want to speak but they cannot, they feel helpless. They are always striving to recover from this terrible situation. They are waiting to be free to live a happy life. The purpose of the exhibition is to stand up for justice. The artist regards awakening the common people against injustice as his solemn duty. He is also concerned about the role of the United Nations. He feels that artists have a lot more to do, irrespective of caste, creed, religion and national boundaries. “Everyone should stand up for peace, equality, human rights and speak out for justice and a better future. These are the messages I want to relay through my artworks,” remarked the artist.

The students are passionate about art,” said David Dalla Venezia, who taught the students a simple, yet amazing technique, portraying classic and neo classic painters like Diego Velázquez (Spain), Tintoretto (Italy) and Odd Nerdrum (Norwegian-Swedish) in their own styles.” I have used both cool and warm colours, so that their contrasting magic gives different kinds of effects. The limited colour pallet – black, red, yellow and white, along with a tinge of blue -- has historical aspects to depict portraits,” he added. David was among the 11 international artists from South Asia and Europe who participated in the ‘Majhi International Art Residency Programme’ presented by Durjoy Bangladesh Foundation in Venice, Italy in July and August last year.

Bangladeshi artist Firoz Mahmud is one of the ten nominees for France’s COAL Prize, from the organisation, Coalition for Art and Sustainable Development, which works in the fields of contemporary art, sustainable development and research, in order to promote the emergence of a culture of ecology. The award ceremony, along with the exhibition of artworks by the nominated artists, will take place at Center Pompidou, Paris, in December this year. Mahmud, who currently resides in New York, was a fellow artist at Rijksakademie VB Kunsten, Amsterdam, and did his MFA and BFA from the Institute of Fine Arts, (Now Faculty of Fine Art) University of Dhaka. He had a solo exhibitions at Bengal Gallery of Fine Arts, Dhaka Art Center, Abinta Gallery of Fine Arts, Asian Art Biennale Bangladesh, Dhaka Art Summit and Bangladesh National Museum. He also exhibited his works at Aichi Triennial, Sharjah Biennale, Cairo Biennale, Echigo-Tsumari Triennial and Setouchi Triennial. Mahmud has been creating paintings, installations, photo based artworks, drawings and mixed media works on paper. As an artist, he focuses on historical and colonial legacies, war and warriors, cultural and mythological landscapes from Bangladesh, the greater Bengal and South Asian region. Most of his works depict colonial and post-colonial legacies of our region, myths and beliefs. He also highlights the issues of exodus and migration, and the dreams of minority groups through his art. “I deliberately tear down the edges of the canvas to shape the composition of my artworks, so that they signify the unrepresented historical legacies. The history of the migration of Bangladeshi people was the research topic during my two-year course at Rijksakademie VB Kunsten in the Netherlands,” said Mahmud In recent years, the globally travelling artist has exhibited his artworks at many important exhibitions, including the Bangkok Art Biennale, Lahore Biennale, Congo Biennale, Dhaka Art Summit, Office of Contemporary Art Norway, Sharjah Art Foundation and MAXXI-National Museum of the 21st Century Arts in Rome, among others. From making texts and concepts to producing the finished artworks, Mahmud is dedicated to his artistic pursuit and perseverance. Reflecting on the recent contemporary global art practice and the challenges, he spoke about New York- based Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. “The world of contemporary art is wild. Maurizio Cattelan, the controversial artist, made a fully functioning 18-carat gold toilet, titled America, which has not yet been recovered after it was stolen from an exhibition at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, UK, in September this year. Contemporary art allows many non-academic artists to make a mark. Such artists are doing well in selling their unusual ideas,” added Mahmud.

The exhibition, jointly supported by Bengal Arts Programme, Korean Cultural Center India and The Foundation for India Contemporary Art (FICA), showcases the works of 10 artists and one research collective from Bangladesh.

The show further discusses related issues of borders and ownership of places and of utopian sensibilities vis-à-vis forced displacements. Participants of the show include Bengal Institute for Architecture, Landscapes and Settlements, Shahidul Alam, Tayeba Begum Lipi, Ronni Ahmmed, Najmun Nahar Keya, Afsana Sharmin Zhumpa, Shimul Saha, Zihan Karim, Sarker Protick, Sayed Asif Mahmud and Md Shamsul Arifin.

Artist Proshanta Karmakar Buddha has created his own style of art that is both modern and unique. He longs for a world devoid of chaos, brutality and hopelessness. He anticipates a peaceful utopia where human empathy and cooperation transcend national boundaries. It may be a 'fool's dream' but a world without hope is not a world worth living in. The spirit of that hope echoes through his works. Till date, Buddha has put up 29 solo exhibitions and participated in at least 96 national and international group exhibitions. Buddha's passion for art inspired him to be a full-time artist, sporting enormous courage and dedication. He received several national and international awards, including the 1992 'Honorable Mention Award' at a competition hosted by Alliance Française de Dhaka, the 1991 Okamoto Prize by the Asian Cultural Center for UNESCO in Tokyo, Japan and the 1990 Best Award on printmaking at the 9th National Young Artist's Exhibition at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy.

Café Mango and Gallery at Dhanmondi is hosting a month long group art exhibition titled, King Kortobbyo . The inaugural ceremony of the exhibition was held on November 24. The exhibition displays collective artworks by Azizee Fawmi Khan, Rakib Anwar, Khairul Alam, Al Nasir, Jawad Hossain, Pijush Talukder and Mehedi Hasan. The opening ceremony was attended by distinguished guests, including eminent artists Monirul Islam, Abul Barq Alvi, Dr Rashid Amin, Assistant Professor, Department of Fine Arts & Graphics, Jagannath University, Nazia Andaleeb Preema, Director at Bangladesh Brand Forum, Wakilur Rahman of Kala Kendra art gallery and Ashraf Kaiser, Managing Director of Benchmark Limited. Salauddin Ahmed, proprietor of Café Mango and Gallery expressed his intention of opening up the cafeteria space to host more exhibitions in the future, giving opportunities to young creative minds to showcase their works. The idea behind King Kortobbyo is to use the cafeteria space to blend art into conversation, which is why the subjects of the works addresses human life, inner thoughts and expressions, emotions and many contemporary issues of society. King Kortobbyo aims to satirise the absolutist ideas of being right or wrong, reasoning that even the absolute right will eventually feel like the absolute wrong by virtue of its self-absorbed authoritarian nature. The artworks present a juxtaposition of utopian and dystopian state of minds to acknowledging the coexistence of good and evil within everyone. The concept for the exhibition is unconventional in the sense that every member of the group had inputs in each other's works and the artworks at display on each wall are intended to be viewed collectively as one work. Most of the participants come from a professional background in advertising and media, with experience in art direction, visualisation, audio visual, cinematography and copywriting. The artworks show a heavy influence of commercial art as well as elements of pop art and shock art through the use of vibrant colours and texts. King Kortobbyo intends to stick to its unconventional approach in exhibition and keep adding new artworks throughout its run. The exhibition will be open to all, from 12 noon to 10 pm every day until December 21 at Café Mango and Gallery.

Having said that, we are considering turning it into an annual event.\" Special Olympics is considered as one of the largest sports organisations in the world, established by Eunice Kennedy Shriver in 1968. It aims to transform the lives of differently abled people through the power, spirit and joy of sports. The athletes of Special Olympics Bangladesh have proved their determination by competing and winning in national and international sports events since 1995. During the Special Olympics World Summer Games 2019, held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, our athletes won 22 gold, 10 silver and 6 bronze medals, according to Special Olympics Bangladesh.

Humour and satire have great potential to bring visibility to and foster critical thinking on different social issues. In this regard, cartoons are an important element in contemporary social activism and a communication tool that can spread key messages across. We have seen artists use cartoons as an instrument for revealing injustice, discrimination, violence and suffering in different times for different reasons - starting from Picasso in the 1900s in Europe to Kais Al-Hilali in the 2000s in Africa. Even in Bangladesh, cartoons have always been a powerful tool to reach out to civilians and gain their support during socio-political movements, be it the democratic movement in the 1990s or the recent student protests for road safety. Keeping that in mind, ActionAid Bangladesh (AAB), in collaboration with Unmad, has organised a cartoon exhibition titled, FemiToon, at Drik Gallery. The goal of the event is to connect young people with the issue of violence against women and girls through visual representation. The exhibition showcases artworks of young cartoonists from all over Bangladesh that speak about the frustration regarding the current state of violence against women. The cartoons in the exhibition focus on different types of violence against women, including sexual and reproductive rights violation, child marriage, dowry, rape, unpaid care work, acid attacks and a plethora of others. The cartoons will further be exhibited beyond the capital, in Cox's Bazar and AAB's Local Rights Programs areas all over Bangladesh. AAB believes that this initiative will work as a stepping stone to start a dialogue on ending violence against women and will continue to speak to the audience of this generation to the next. The exhibition, which took off on November 26, concludes today.

{"title": "Different Images of Men: Photo exhibition underway at BSA | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Action Aid Bangladesh is an international organisation that works towards social justice, gender equality and poverty eradication. The organisation, in association with Drik gallery and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, has arranged a photography exhibition titled Different Images of Men. The inauguration programme was held at the National Art Gallery of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy (BSA), yesterday. The exhibition underway at gallery-4, was inaugurated by the Minister of Planning Government of Bangladesh M A Mannan, MP. He was the chief guest of the programme. At the inaugural ceremony, he mentioned that it is difficult to evaluate the untiring responsibilities of women, and their hard work cannot be ignored. It is the duty of the men to share the responsibilities equally. The aim of the exhibition is to create awareness towards the role of men in the society. According to Action Aid, women working at home usually do not get their due appreciation from the society. The exhibition persuades the idea that household chores are responsibilities of everyone, irrespective of gender. The event was presided over by the country director of Action Aid Bangladesh, Farah Kabir. “If the government shows more concern about the domestic public policy at the marginal levels, and create more space for women to be economically independent, it is possible to witness a rapid change in the society,” she said. Professor Dr Meghna Guhathakurta, executive director of Research Initiatives, Bangladesh, spoke about the importance of men contributing to domestic work. “In 2018, in Lalmonirhat, Gaibandha, a study was conducted into a total of ten unions. According to the research, women spend seven hours per day in domestic service, while men spend less than three hours. Increasing in participation of men in the domestic works, will lead to a productive and healthy society. This will eventually change the perception of the society towards women. This will also result in developing the infrastructure and facilities needed to ensure the protection of women. As the programme went on, the winners of the photography contests were announced. The winners are -- Salahuddin Ahmed, Farhana Akhter and Shahnewaz Shoikot in the first, second and third position respectively. Along with this, seven photographers received honorary awards. The open for all photography exhibition will continue until November 5, every day from 11 am till 8 pm, at The National Art Gallery number four, BSA.

On the first day of Chobimela X, a discussion session on 'Freedom of Thought and Expression', a topic that is quite relevant in today's context, was held at the Drik-Pathshala under-construction building. The panelists of the discussion included Kunda Dixit, Editor of Nepali Times, a weekly English language newspaper in Kathmandu, Tanvi Mishra, Photo Editor of The Caravan, a journal on politics and culture, Nurul Kabir, Editor of New Age, a daily English language newspaper in Bangladesh, and Rahnuma Ahmed, writer and anthropologist. The discussion focused on forming solidarity among journalists, particularly in South Asia, where the media is constantly facing administrative backlash. “Freedom of thought and expression are two things people across the world have been fighting for over the years,” said Nurul Kabir, “However circumstances in South Asia show that people here are far more oppressed than those in the West. To make democracy participatory, media should be free to think and express.” The controversial section 57 of the ICT Act was also part of the discussion. “Now that the mainstream media is in control, next target is social media,” said Kunda Dixit. “New cyber and privacy laws have been passed in order to constrict the media's freedom of expression.” Furthermore, Rahnuma Ahmad believes that freedom of thought and expression should be exercised by everyone, not only journalists. “We are living in difficult times. Just as fear is contagious, courage is also contagious. When people come forward, it inspires other people.” Tanvi Misha, on the other hand, thinks that artistes will always find a way to use the restrictions to feed their work and be more creative.

{"title": "Dreams without borders: When I Grow Up | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. “You have to understand, no one puts their children in a boat unless the water is safer than the land.” These lines by Warsan Shire could not be more appropriate to describe the ill-fate brought upon the Rohingya children. Residing in the refugee camps, these children, with the lack of education and opportunities, are losing out on their future. Returning to their homeland, still remains unresolved. Despite these facts, their dreams remain big and borderless. On the occasion of World Refugee Day this year, Amnesty International in partnership with UNICEF and EMK Center, organised a five-day exhibition recently, titled When I Grow Up , with the artworks of 160 Rohingya refugee children. With the assistance of six well-known Bangladeshi cartoonists, the children drew their aspirations about what they wish to become when they grow up. The artists spent two days with the children in the camps and helped them colour their dreams. “Children are always wonderful. We thought that the language could a problem, because there were children as young as four years old, but when we began drawing, the barrier between us seemed to fade away,” says cartoonist and Executive Editor of Dhaka Comics, Nasreen Sultana Mitu. Childhood being the most formative period in a child’s life, almost one third of the over 300,000 children aged 4 – 14, do not have access to education, while the remainder have access to informal education, in the refugee camps. “Art can be therapeutic for these children who have been through traumatic situations. However the number of children are too high to cover by such art camps,” explained Mehedi Haque, founder of Dhaka Comics. “If they include art and creative work in their school curriculums, then it can have a better impact and we would be happy to help.” The colourful drawings depicted an array of professions the children aspired to take up. Most children desired to become the people they admire the most, like teachers and doctors. Some let their imaginations soar, and wished to fly planes and take their families to places. No matter what they wished to be, almost all the drawings had a house, some domestic animals and flowers. The little notes underneath the drawings had words of empathy. They all wanted to help the people of the community. The pictures definitely spoke volumes. Along with their future dreams, the drawings also revealed their memories of a familiar space, they believe they should be living in.

An exhibition was held recently by Elora Parvin, who presented hand-stitched portraits of famous personalities throughout global history, at Drik gallery in Dhanmondi. Though she is a housewife, Elora likes to spend her free time stitching and creating artwork. Eminent novelist Selina Hossain, Chairman of Bangladesh Shishu Academy, recently inaugurated the event. A special segment of the display depicted the freedom movement of the Bangladeshi people, along with the gruesome attack on the Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Another remarkable creation by Elora managed to encapsulate the essence of Bangladesh through her stitch work. It portrayed the Sundarbans, Royal Bengal Tigers, jackfruits, magpie-robins, water lilies on the river bank and our national fish, Hilsa. As Elora talked about her art, she disclosed a strong connection about her unconditional love for the motherland. She nurtured an appreciation for art since a very young age. She finds immense satisfaction in stitching her artworks. “I work for eight to ten hours every day to complete my creations,” expressed Elora. “Each piece narrates a different story.” Through her work, she wishes to pay a small tribute to legendary figures like Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his family, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi and others. A wide range of other prominent personalities like Kazi Nazrul Islam, Rabindranath Tagore, Begum Rokeya, Shakib Al Hasan, Mashrafe Mortaza, Runa Laila, and Sabina Yasmin also adorned the walls of the gallery. Having conducted her first solo exhibition with success, Elora is enthusiastic to continue the hard work. “I am glad people appreciate my artworks. It is a major confidence boost up,” she added. She plans to partake in global competitions to represent Bangladesh through her stitch work and wishes to conduct more diverse exhibitions in the future.

{"title": "Fabric (ated) Fractures: A seminal art show in Dubai | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Samdani Art Foundation, in collaboration with Alserkal, recently hosted a major art exhibition titled Fabric(ated) Fractures at Concrete, Alserkal Avenue, Dubai, UAE. The group exhibition, featuring 15 artists of Bangladeshi, South Asian, and Southeast Asian origins, boasted of bringing together diverse arts and artists beyond borders, creating a fantastic platform for artistic and cultural exchange between two countries. The group exhibition, curated by Diana Campbell Betancourt, Samdani Art Foundation Artistic Director and Chief Curator of Dhaka Art Summit, featured works by 15 artists -- Pablo Bartholomew, Rashid Choudhury, Kanak Chanpa Chakma, Rajesh Vangad and Gauri Gill, Shilpa Gupta, Hitman Gurung, Ayesha Jatoi, Ashfika Rahman, Joydeb Roaja, Reetu Sattar, Kamruzzaman Shadhin, Debasish Shom, Jakkai Siributr and Munem Wasif. Eight of the 15 artists were from Bangladesh. “Dhaka Art Summit is a continuous exercise in challenging how the world sees Bangladesh and how Bangladesh sees herself,” said Diana Campbell Betancourt, Curator of the exhibition. “I’m delighted that we are able to extend this conversation through this project in Dubai, both through the exhibition as well as the powerful performance programme which puts the human at the centre of the exhibition through poetic and artistic gestures by Ayesha Jatoi, Reetu Sattar, and Joydeb Roaja.” Fabric(ated) Fractures provided a platform to amplify the voices of artists from Bangladesh and South and Southeast Asia, and explores ‘sensitive spaces’—spaces that challenge ideas of nation, state, and territory. The exhibition design intervenes in the architecture of Concrete, spanning its height with community-based artworks that are humanist acts of insurgency against rising polarisation in the region (and the rest of the world), and grounding the exhibition in a more porous pre-colonial past through the use of a vernacular mud floor found in many South Asian villages. Nadia Samdani, Co-Founder and President of the Samdani Art Foundation, and Director of the Dhaka Art Summit, spoke about the significance of presenting South Asian artists in a global art hub. “Various art projects of previous Dhaka Art Summits travel around the world until the next summit. This exhibition is part of such initiative,” she said. “The interesting aspects of the show are the representation of works by three-generation Bangladeshi artists --- modernist master Rashid Choudhury, renowned artist Kanak Chanpa Chakma and internationally acclaimed contemporary artists. The display demonstrated our commissioned works by Reetu Sattar and Kamruzzaman Shadhin. The Museum of Modern Art, New York has now acquired, Reetu’s work while Garage Museum of Contemporary Art, Moscow, exhibited Shadhin’s work.” About the collaboration and response from the audience, Rajeeb Samdani, the Co-Founder and Trustee of the Samdani Art Foundation, said, “Alserkal Avenue, has been the partner of Dhaka Art Summit since its 2016 edition. Through Alserkal Avenue, and its renowned cultural district of contemporary art galleries, UAE has become one of the global hub of contemporary art.” The response from the audience was tremendous, as the 2019 Sharjah Biennial was simultaneously running. We for the first time, declared the 2020 Dhaka Art Summit to be held in February next year in Dhaka, during the exhibition in Dubai.” He mentioned that this was the first official launching of the summit outside Europe. “Our relationship with the Samdani Art Foundation began long before this exhibition. From our very first encounter, the foundation’s values echoed strongly with our own. As we discovered the various commonalities in our mandates, we explored ways to further bring our shared vision to life: making interdisciplinary dialogue part of the fabric of our contemporary societies; supporting cultural practitioners as they explore their practices; and creating a platform for artistic and discursive exchange,” said Abdelmonem Bin Eisa Alserkal, founder of Alserkal. While this exhibition was born within the borders of what is now considered Bangladesh, Fabric(ated) Fractures examines how the lines demarcating this young country are constantly shifting. The waters that move across Bangladesh’s edges are shared with India and Myanmar, flowing into wider border issues that extend into Thailand, Pakistan, and Nepal—the countries that the 15 artists in this exhibition come from. Their works break down reductive national and regional narratives, and reformulate them from a more local and human perspective. The militarisation of the Chittagong Hill Tracts inspires the drawings of Joydeb Roaja, who comes from the indigenous Tripura community. The military motifs from the Generation Wish Yielding Trees and Atomic Tree series are reflected in his alpona installation in The Yard in Alserkal Avenue, which can be viewed throughout the duration of the exhibition. Through his work, Pablo Bartholomew traces the links between geographically fractured indigenous Chakma communities (ethnic minorities in Myanmar, India, and Bangladesh), weaving together science, myth, legend, and tradition to explore a cross-border ethnic identity in an installation comprised of photographs and woven textiles. The Bangladeshi artist Kanak Chanpa Chakma revisits the ‘Ramu Incident’ through her series of paintings, soul piercing, juxtaposing photographic documentation and newspaper clippings from the 2012 incident against imagery of peaceful Buddhist architecture. Speaking to the potential found in seeing through multiple points of view, the late Rashid Choudhury’s majestic woven tapestries allude to village life in Bengal prior to externally introduced religious divides, and teem with movement, referencing pluralistic rituals of celebration and worship. Ashfika Rahman’s powerful portrait series, Rape is Political, depicts rape victims in the Khagrachari hills area, located at the militarised border between India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar, where state administrative machinery is used to protect rapists. Reetu Sattar performed Harano Sur (Lost Tune), a piece that focuses on the harmonium, a musical instrument that is tightly integrated into the traditional culture of Bangladesh, but is in danger of disappearing. A film documents a performance that brought together musicians, each playing three notes of the seven notes of the harmonium as part of the exhibition. Kamruzzaman Shadhin’s installation Haven is Elsewhere was created through a large-scale action: a year and a half spent exchanging the clothes of Rohingya refugees at Bangladesh’s southern border with Southeast Asia for new garments. The refugees’ clothes were joined into a monumental piece of fabric embellished with traditional Bangladeshi kantha embroidery. Munem Wasif’s haunting series of black and white photographs of the blurred boundary of Bangladesh and India, Land of Undefined Territory, conceals the intense human interaction within its surface.

Fawaz Rob comes from architectural and design background, but he is also an internationally celebrated artist. His works have been shown in Nepal, India, Italy, Croatia and France. He accumulates his urban experience and creates a dreamlike scenario of Dhaka. He is an assistant professor at the Department of Architecture at North South University, Dhaka. Fawaz obtained his undergraduate degree from San Francisco, USA and Master's degree from Florence, Italy. He has worked in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Barcelona, Rome and Berlin before settling down in Dhaka as a university teacher. As a protest to the recent declaration that Dhaka is the second least livable city, Fawaz explores the life and architecture of the place through his printmaking. His art also explores the everyday life of construction, traffic, rickshaws, crows and other natural elements of Dhaka. The artist is exhibiting around 30 etchings and aquatints on Bangladeshi handmade paper at the event. “We tend to focus far too much on Dhaka's traffic congestion. However, this four-hundred-year-old city has many secrets hidden in its alleys. The Mughals, British, French, and even Armenians have left architectural marks in the city.” Most French people are unaware of Dhaka's life and architecture.

Four Indian artists, Aditya Basak, Chandra Bhattacharjee, Atin Basak and Jayanta Naskar, were a part of the Bangladesh Art Trip 2019, from July 26 to 31. Galleri Kaya invited the artists and organised their trip to Chittagong, Cox’s Bazar and Dhaka. Renowned artist and gallerist Gautam Chakrabarty accompanied them in the trip. The artists interacted with several Bangladeshi journalists at Galleri Kaya on July 30. “Close contacts between Bangladeshis and Indians are necessary. An artistic arrangement of this kind paves the way for engagement and interaction between different artists from both the nations,” said Aditya Basak, whose works mainly shed light on the atrocious ramifications of World War I and II. Gautam Chakrabarty stated that the objective of the art trip was to familiarise the Indian artists with the culture and people of Bangladesh and that he looks forward to taking part in many more such trips in the future. “Bangladeshi artists regularly go to India to participate in different art workshops. We contact them in India, but we seldom come to Bangladesh. Galleri Kaya has given us that opportunity,” said Chandra Bhattacharjee, who works on human visages and their multifarious expressions along with the language of the body.

{"title": "GHARTERA EDITION 0: JUNKYARD | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Ghartera Edition 0: Junkyard is a group art exhibition that comments on the way we think about art. It initiates dialogue, and challenges preconceived notions of the art world in a bid to bring us further away from the image of art being preserved in a glass box, accessible only to an elite few. In that regard, the organisers approached Dwip Gallery, a humble space in Lalmatia that is open to new and innovative ways of displaying art. The exhibition shows that art can be more - it is not something to see and forget about, but something we can touch, feel and smell. It urges us to communicate directly with the artwork in a way that gives life to the concept that an artwork's meaning is only completed once the viewer engages with it and perceives it in their own way. It is well curated in thought and message. The show's principles are loud and clear, especially among the powerful use of images. Kazi Tahsin Agaz Apurbo, who is also the curator of the event, exhibits photo-collages that feature bizarre juxtapositions and force the viewer's eyes to take note of the details that are generally ignored in plain images. “I want to promote the practice of making art from a critical-political lens and create safe pockets for those artworks to be displayed in a way which is more accessible for people from all walks of life,” says Apurbo. A series of photographs by Navid Nooren, titled, Decaying Nature, are displayed on light-boxes that brought forward interesting technicolour hues, prompting us to view the image in quite literally, a new light. The series comments on the distortion of our environment in the name of development. The displayed artworks also feature a series of traditional paintings on canvas, but the surprise element lay in the canvases being nailed to a panel on the wall, so that the paintings seem like window-doors, which we could turn and go through like a large picture book, except the paintings are real. Juxta-Beauty, an engrossing installation, is put together by Inan Anjum Sibun, accompanied by a poem written on the wall. The poem talks about failed expectations and mirrors, reflecting white drawings of many versions of women's faces and bodies on black carton-like boxes placed on two corner walls like puzzle pieces. The piece also includes broken shards of a mirror, an old head phone, a camera and a TV remote. We might interpret this as the many different layers of a female, which is most often not portrayed in the media. Mushfiqur Rahman Johan displays a series of photographs printed on film-like rolls. The photo rolls include handwritten text that explains the inspiration behind the series. According to a viewer, the images portray both sadness and joy, as they feature Shumi, a young domestic worker. In some photos she plays like the child she is, in others she is captured in more sombre tones doing chores such as cleaning, cooking and washing. The exhibition will run till April 25 from 3 pm to 9 pm.

A weeklong group exhibition titled Strokes , by six artists is underway at Zainul Gallery-2, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. The show was inaugurated on July 16. A single dot joins with other dots to form a line. This line is being further developed to strokes. Here, the ‘strokes’ symbolize the six participating artists -- Aminul Islam, Md Tanvirul Islam (Mithu), Md Iqbal Hossain, Aowlad Hossain, S M Asad and Md Zakir-us Salam as six dots, forming a bigger line for the greater good in the realm of art. Since pre-historic times, men have expressed themselves through art. Even today, it has claimed its position of greatness, excelling from time to time. Every line, every dot starts with a thought, channeled through brushes, pencils, pens, oils, watercolours, acrylics and charcoal. This particular idea has been introduced to create a platform, where both art and artists achieve greater heights to gain and share ideas and experiences through interactive workshop, research, art camp, exhibition, publication, digital archive and gallery shows. Strokes is not just comprised of 6 members, it is a platform where new artists are welcomed, with no age limits. The newer painters will gain valuable lessons from the established and mature ones. Also, the senior artists will be introduced to the veterans, forming an inseparable bond amongst themselves.

{"title": "Guru-Shishya: Shishya-Guru in review | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Guru- Shishya parampara is an ancient teaching-learning heritage of the sub-continent. Over time, the line between the pedagogue and the students has reaches a blur, where the student takes the spot of the teacher and vice-versa. With this concept, The Oriental Painting Studio Bangladesh is hosting their first group exhibition titled, Guru-Shishya: Shishya-Guru at La Galerie, Alliance Française de Dhaka. The featured artists at the exhibition are Malay Bala, Zahangir Alom and Amit Nandi. The exhibition is dedicated to the late artist Shawkatuzzaman. During the inauguration, Professor Nisar Hossain, Dean, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka (DU), explained the trajectory of oriental painting and corrected the myths associated with it. \"It is not mimicking what we see. Oriental art is the expression that lies within what we see presented in a completely new way,\" he said. He went on to explain how the nephew of Rabindranath Tagore, Abanindranath Tagore, was the creator of the Indian Society of Oriental Art and was the most critically important figure of the influential Bengal School of Art, which led to the development of modernity in Indian painting. In the exhibition, while the master extracted his inspiration from the rasa of Shankuntala, disciple Zahangir Alom placed the colours of nature on his canvas, while Amit Nandi enacted the verses from Mahabharata in his own style. Curated by Amirul Rajiv, the distinct characteristic of each artist was visible through their work. However the arrangement could have been improved. The wall with cool colour palette suddenly ending with intense bright colours creates visual discomfort. The character in exhibition demanded a smoother transition. Visual artist Malay Bala is an associate professor at the Department of Oriental Art, DU and the preceptor of Zahangir and Amit. His storytelling through soft colours and ancient figures is a treat to the eyes. \"I do not have many messages hidden in my paintings. I intend to take my audience through an emotional journey,” says Malay Bala. “The figures in my painting are from the traditional verses of Shakuntala who are engaged in joyful activity.\" The portraits of Tagore and Gautam Buddha wrapped around the rhythmic root figures beamed serenity. The solo wall with the monochromatic portrait tribute to mime artist Partha Pratim Majumder stood out beautifully. Visual artist Zahangir Alom takes his inspiration from nature. Although he calls himself a self-taught artist, his Gurus call him the master of colours. Taming the bright colours is child's play for him. \"He is brilliant with colours. I often ask him to mix the colours for me. I like his passion for learning and often I learn from him\", comments Guru Malay Bala on Alom. Most of his paintings had the wash-effect. The fluidity of his work looked like music on canvas. \"I do not follow any grammar. I travel a lot to gather inspiration,” says Alom. “I observe the colours of nature and try to bring the same on canvas.” The youngest of the three is Amit Nandi, a lecturer at Department of Oriental Art, DU. The centerpiece of the exhibition was his painting, Raga Kedar. The soft-spoken artist mentioned that he takes inspiration from mythological sagas and blend it with everyday actions. “I used figures from Kalighat painting but blended them with my own interpretation of the sagas,” Amit comments. He also mentioned the art addas at the studio help him to conceive the ideas. Along with his framed paintings, his miniature sagas from the Mahabharata were highly appreciated. His preceptors and seniors ushered him with words of appreciation during the exhibition. Malay Bala said, “By age I maybe the eldest but I am highly moved by the works of Zahangir and Amit. Amit is a very talented; he has not only surpassed his peers but also his preceptors.” The Oriental Painting Studio Bangladesh also runs a study group that has successfully organised eight oriental painting exhibitions with participants from home and abroad. They began 2019 with this group exhibition and have more events coming up. The studio intends to open new opportunities for oriental art in Bangladesh. The exhibition is open for all and will run until February 1 from 3 pm to 9 pm on weekdays, and from 9 am to 12 noon and 5 pm- 8 pm on the weekends.

As an artist, she incorporates the nuances of music into her canvas. “Waheed bhai wanted me to perform the songs; for which he would give me incentives and original 78 RPMs (revolutions per minute) to listen to the songs so that I can perform them. I also collected several 78 RPMs from my paternal grandfather's residence,” says Dewan. Her 14th solo painting exhibition tiled Chander Eto Alo (The Brilliant Moon) starts at Shilpangan Gallery, Lalmatia, Dhaka tomorrow. Internationally famous artist Monirul Islam will inaugurate the show as the chief guest. “The title of the exhibition is taken from the song, Chander Eto Alo , Tobu Shey Amarey Daak-e, Utola Madhobi Raat-e by Talat Mahmood. I also recorded the song for one of my CDs,” mentions Dewan. Though she was fond of painting from a young age, she started pursuing it seriously in 1990, when Bengal Foundation produced 33 LPs (Long plays) for her. “Abul Khair, the chairman of Bengal Foundation, wanted to use one of my paintings for the LP. I completed quite a number of paintings,” she explains. “Later, he suggested that I hold a solo exhibition with the rest of the artworks. My first solo exhibition was held at German Cultural Centre in 1992. After that, I went to pursue an art education course in London. However, I did not complete it after two months of intensive studies.” For Dewan, painting is a way of depicting literary pieces that portray parts of her own life. “Moonbeams and its reflecting ambience are prominent in my recent works and music is intuitively inserted into my paintings,” expresses Dewan, who has so far exhibited her works at several galleries in Dhaka, Kolkata, Singapore, and Paris. “I exercise freedom in my practice of paintings on soft pastel and acrylic. I feel great when I can depict the canvas with my favourite colours, and the same goes for performing songs.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/news/iffat-ara-dewans-solo-art-show-shilpangan-open-tomorrow-1687048", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 367}

A group exhibition titled, Jolokabbo 2 - Musings in Watercolour, opened on Wednesday at Edge Gallery in Dhaka. 26 artists are participating in the event, which features watercolour paintings. Upcoming young artists, as well as revered painters in the field, like Jamal Ahmed and Monirul Islam, are exhibiting their works at the show. With watercolour as the central theme of the exhibition, the different paintings explore relationships, both natural and man-made. The use of watercolour has not only been a popular choice among artists, but it has historically established itself as the technique chosen by people to express their feelings. In this exhibition, the organisers aim to display works which depict the memories of the people of the country, through its different seasons. Among the subjects explored on canvases and inside frames, the common views of Old Dhaka city streets, landscapes from the countryside, as well as the rivers of Bangladesh, are seen. Many artists veered out of the ordinary to incorporate contemporary practices, to put together a cohesive new perspective. One painting that stands out is A Glory Day by Buriganga by Akhir Sarker. The focus of the painting is a boat on the river Buriganga, surrounded by other boats and ships. The entire painting is done in yellow-green hues, which amplifies the feel of the wreckage we have caused on our rivers. The painting incorporates figurative and abstract styles to create a truly a immersive atmosphere for the viewers. Splatters of paint accurately imitate the splutters created by the engine of the boat and washes of yellows and greens portray the fumes and toxicity of the environment in a way that reminds us of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Other paintings seen at the exhibition included titles such as Winter Morning,Winter Evening, Shoroter Bandorban and Forest Lights. Renowned artist Jamal Ahmed presented a painting called, In Search of Food, which shows a seagull flying across against a backdrop of water and sky, meshing into each other in strokes of blue and white. The viewer would be struck by the simplicity of the artwork, and its ability to remind us of the crisis of climate change. Jolokabbo 2 - Musings in Watercolour is well curated and brings together many perspectives harmoniously. It provides a great opportunity for art enthusiasts of Bangladesh to appreciate the talents of the nation, by exposing themselves to thought-provoking artworks. The exhibition will run till October 16.

Unsettled features pieces that are not pure photographs, but superimposed, manipulated images. “I started to create these images as a coping mechanism for my mental health struggles, which were triggered from the existing politics of my geo-political location. These are also a documentation of how depression and anxiety are political,” explains Apurbo. “The kind of climate and time that we currently live in does not allow us to access our basic human rights, one of them being the freedom of expression.

Alliance Française de Dhaka (AFD) and Moonsez Art Academy jointly organised Daak-ticketey Dekhi Amar Desh (Looking at My Country Through Stamps ), a group painting exhibition by budding child painters of Moonsez Art Academy. Held at the Galerie Zoom in Alliance Francaise de Dhaka, the exhibition is open to all till October 19. It is a resultant of a 21-day workshop conducted by artist Shadia Sharmin at the art academy. The exhibition is supported by the Philatelists' Association of Bangladesh. The programme was inaugurated by the chief guest, Director General of Bangladesh Post Office, Sushanto Kumar Mondal. Visual Artist Dr SM Saiful Islam was present as the special guest. Spanning from the nineteenth century to the present, the history of postage stamps is fascinating and rich. Bangladesh saw her first set of stamps during the Liberation War on July 29, 1971, that exhibited the international support for the nation. The stamps of Bangladesh since then have seen glorious days, from masterfully-drawn commemorative stamps to beautiful and historical first day covers. The children of Moonsez Art Academy were able to experience Bangladesh in a very different yet familiar way by looking at the stamps and be inspired to construct their own versions of the stamps. Participants also received recognition for their work.

Renowned artist Mohammad Iqbal’s 44th solo exhibition is underway at Gallery APA, Nagoya, Japan. The show was inaugurated on August 24, and will run till September 1. Eminent actor, elocutionist and cultural personality Asaduzzaman Noor, MP, attended the inaugural ceremony of the exhibition as an honourable guest. Dr Mohammad Iqbal, an Associate Professor at the Department of Drawing and Painting, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka, is a contemporary painter. His canvases feature various enigmatic and shadowy faces. The backgrounds of most of his compositions contain abstract forms, soothing colours and mellow tones and textures. For the ongoing show, the artist is exhibiting around 28 oil paintings, representing feminine visages along with portrayals of the skies and hills. Shattered dreams, desires, and the deprivation of children, especially girls, are recurrent themes in some of his works. The eyes of the children, portrayed by Iqbal, speak of their suffering and the society’s maltreatments and unjust attitudes towards them. According to the artist, children are the worst victims of wars. In his paintings, he brings out children’s emotional eyes, that express the longing for better days to come. “I haven’t always maintained one particular method, style, or technique. I like to articulate the process of thinking, and then incorporate emotions and personal experiences in my works,” he explains. During the exhibition, he attracted the audience by doing live paintings. Iqbal’s oil paintings are famous for featuring eight to ten layers of colours. He puts them on empty spaces of the canvas to denote the imaginary icon of the non-visual agents that cause environmental pollution. Iqbal is a MONBUSHO Scholar. He has a PhD in Oil Painting from the Tokyo National University of the Arts and Music, Japan. His paintings have been exhibited in many renowned galleries of Japan and Bangladesh. In 1993, he was a post-graduate student at the Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. That year, he participated in the Osaka International Triennial and won a prestigious award. He received a scholarship in Japan during his visit. “Japanese art is known for its soft colours, minimal expressions and meticulous lines and forms. The country’s serene environment has hugely influenced many painters’ works over centuries,” said Iqbal. “Japanese painters’ works are frequently done in subtle tones and carefully chosen textures. They always search for perfection. Their works are more technique-based and demonstrate a sense of artistry.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/exhibition/news/mohammad-iqbals-solo-exhibition-japan-1792531", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 446}

As a graduate from the Academy of Fine Arts of Yunnan Academy of Arts, he participated in numerous national and international art exhibitions in China and Bangladesh. Mong’s Song of Fisherman--The Creation of Harbor series has received widespread critical acclaim. “I was born and brought up in a coastal region of Bangladesh,” says the artist. “Maheshkhali is an island in the Bay of Bengal under Cox’s Bazar where I was born in 1989. I have strong memories of the lifestyle of the fishermen living there. The day labourers, boat makers, businessmen and other people have also influenced me.” As a child, Mong played games by the seashore, where he saw anchored fishing boats every day. He dreamed of becoming a boat-maker someday. “I realise that my cherished dream is being fulfilled through my watercolour paintings,” he says. “My Fisher Boat series is being appreciated.” Before starting the Fisher Boat series, Mong looked for a subject to portray in paintings. For his commitment to art, Mong has received many awards, including the ZN Art-Krasi Todorov Award for exceptional contribution to World Watercolour, International Youth Watercolor Festival in Bulgaria, Honourable Mention Award for Canson Cup 2018 Paper Work Exhibition in China, and the Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Award, among others.

Eminent artist Monirul Islam inaugurated the exhibition yesterday as the special guest. The exhibition is based on woodcut prints from the outcome of a printmaking workshop at Cosmos Atelier71 Studio, conducted by artist Anisuzzaman Anis, Professor, Printmaking Department, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. The entire exhibition consists of the woodblock prints produced by 30 talented artists who participated in the workshop. Workshops are a great way for accomplished artists to pass on their skills and explain the processes behind some of their most extraordinary pieces of work. The workshop for Musicality in Wood was no different in this regard, as Anisuzzaman spoke about the finer points of the woodblock technique that he has mastered. Woodblock, or woodcut, is a traditional form of relief printing, where the artist's design or drawing is made on a piece of wood, and the untouched areas are then cut away with gouges, leaving the raised image which is then inked.

Time and its essence of the past, present and future are the main focus of self-taught artist Nafiuzzaman Nafi's solo exhibition, Shomoyer Kabyakala . 148 of the artist's works are currently on display at Dwip Gallery in Lalmatia. Such a concentration of work pulls away from the viewer's ability to give each artwork its adequate importance. Moreover, one might also opine that it inhibits an artist's body of work from giving meaning to the surrounding cultural context. Since his exhibition on cubism in 2015, Nafi has explored different forms of expression. At the same time, his previous works' imprint can be found on his current paintings as well. He said that he worked in charcoal for an extensive period of time and has wandered into the use of colour in mixed media only of late. He makes use of backgrounds in washes of bright and vibrant hues with drawings in black in the foreground. His black marks create an almost abstract web among which figures of human masks, faces and animal figures such as cow heads, snakes and fish can be found. Two large paintings that take up an entire wall of the gallery stand out. They have almost luminescent like backgrounds of yellow and green respectively. Repetitive patterns and lines adorn the paintings among which eyes and figures jump out at the viewer and manage to have an overwhelming effect. Nafi also mentioned that most of his artworks are conceptualised as he goes about his days absorbing the world around him especially with regards to current affairs. From matters such as corruptio, child abuse to the Holey Artisan attack in Dhaka, have all impacted Nafi in his art making. The exhibition will run till January 29 from 3 pm to 9 pm.

UNICEF Bangladesh and AFD are jointly organising the exhibition. UNICEF Bangladesh Goodwill Ambassador and cricket icon, Shakib Al Hasan, UNICEF Bangladesh representative, Edouard Beigbeder and French Ambassador to Bangladesh, Marie-Annick Bourdin jointly inaugurated the exhibition. Edouard Beigbeder said, “This exhibition not only portrays the hopelessness and despair of a people in peril, but it also captures their unmatched ability to bounce back in life with little support to ensure fulfillment of their basic needs.” Shakib Al Hasan added,“We should come forward to solve the problem soon.” The exhibition has a collection of photographs snapped by Patrick Brown during the last one year, portraying the initial influx, the resilience of the Rohingyas, the host community, emergency mitigation measures and international support to the Rohingya people. More than a year ago, a startled international community watched a dramatic humanitarian crisis unfold on the north-eastern edge of the Bay of Bengal. In a matter of weeks, hundreds of thousands of desperate and terrorised people — 60 percent of whom were children — poured across the border from Myanmar into Bangladesh, bringing with them accounts of the unspeakable violence and brutality that had forced them to flee. UNICEF has been on the ground in southern Bangladesh since the onset of the crisis as part of a coalition of national and international agencies. Patrick Brown is the recipient of numerous international awards including the 3P Photographer Award, World Press Photo Award, Picture of The Year Award and New York Photographic Book Award, to name a few.

Curated by noted artist Wakilur Rahman, the colourful, experimental and bold exhibition deals with a layer of the featured photographer's diverse state of mind . This photographic body of work was started from the middle of 2014 as Tuli's self-portrait series. “I had been photographing what makes me think and what is related to my own life. Self-discovery is an intriguing journey, one that I constantly struggle to get a grip on,” said Mahmuda Tuli. “With this series, I tried to capture different shades of myself using colour, object and movement to explore the malleable nature of the human mind. The series helps to define my mood swings and the evident energy within oneself and the surroundings.” Comparing the practice of photography in the then and present time Bangladesh, renowned photographer Nasir Ali Mamun spoke at the inaugural ceremony. “It's a matter of joy and pride that talented photographers like Mahmuda Tuli are experimenting and enriching the trend of visual art language through their practice,” he said.

Ayesha S Chowdhury, the Principal of Cardiff International School was also a guest at the event. The exhibition features 33 young artists, most of whom are young adults, with total of 80 artworks. The exhibition is about portraying the hidden emotions of our everyday lives. Happiness, despair, suffering, nostalgia, loneliness – were the emotions portrayed in the paintings. It is difficult to convey emotions freely without consequence or ire from the society. These young artists projected their emotions onto the canvas, and poured themselves into the world of colour and imagination. “When we are lost in our thoughts, we feel a lot of emotion at once,” said Iffat Jahan Tusher, one of the artists in the exhibition. “We don’t know the name of that emotion, but we know the feeling, one of my paintings is an effort to convey that emotion. It’s called distorted thought.” “The emotions we wanted to include are not just the morbid ones, our aim was to portray feelings of joy as well,” says Edward William, the President of Cosmo Concepts. Cosmo Concepts is an event management service run by teenagers. Their first art exhibition Say No To Poverty was a huge success. Mukhosher Arale is their second event.

While many people complain about the congested life of Dhaka city, Dr Sajid Bin Doza Bonny draws inspiration from them. The innumerable anonymous faces and their inner colours have thus become the subject of his cultural cartoon exhibition titled, People of many colours. The exhibition is hosted by Alliance Française de Dhaka (AFD). Eminent cartoonist and Editor of Unmad, Ahsan Habib, was present as chief guest at the inaugural ceremony. Cartoonist Nasreen Sultana Mitu and Mehedi Haque were also present as special guests. Nasreen, during her brief speech, called the exhibition a ‘slice of life’ which demostrates the spontaneity of our surroundings that we often tend to ignore. According to Mehedi Haque, the artworks are not only illustrated comments of the society, but also proves the sense of observation, patience and integrity of the artist towards his work. An architect by profession, Dr Sajid has a keen interest in heritage studies and cultural distinctiveness. The nostalgia of his childhood is evident in his impeccable strokes. Very distinctively, Dr Sajid has portrayed seemingly ‘obsolete’ objects, for example a lantern, as a source of exploration for the new generation. Along with people, a number of animals have occupied his canvases. “These animals are inseparable characters of our lives. They might not talk. Yet, they have their expressions,” says the artist. The array of characters are in display until December 31, 2019 at La Galerie, AFD.

Dhaka, a mega city, has reached astonishing growth, from a population of three million in 1980 to 21 million today - creating hopes, dreams and challenges for the citizens, while accommodating urban and social changes, every day.

To that end, Ek Kodom is an attempt to present the diversity of Dhaka through a celebratory environment, full of artworks from diverse media, including paintings, sculptures, and installations. Portraying the modern aspects of the city, the artists, in a synchronal mutual interest, have worked on thoughtful material experimentations. Each of the artists has a distinguished style, in terms of their working process and media selection. Yet, all their artworks express a cohesive theme. From the pointed expressions of Azizee’s paintings, the subtle drama of Rakib’s drawings to the wit and charm of Anisuzzaman’s sculptures, Ek Kodom explores a broad range of elements.

{"title": "“Pursuing art is a solemn perseverance” - Mohammad Eunus | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Renowned artist Professor Mohammad Eunus was born on this day in 1954 to M Eusuf and Fajilatun Noor, of Thakurgaon. His father was a lieutenant of Pakistan Army and founder of Thakurgaon and Dinajpur Scouts. Mohammad Eunus was also a member of scout and joined many jamborees including Pakistan National Jamboree. He has always been interested in art. After he passed his matriculation in 1972, a signboard artist Saifur Rahman from Thakurgaon, influenced Mohammad Eunus greatly. “My father had a sketchbook, and I was fascinated with his sketches. I drew banners for many jatrapala and stage plays, including one on the Liberation War,” said Mohammad Eunus. “Then, I went to the Faculty of Fine Art (FFA), University of Dhaka (DU). As my hand writing and drawing skills were pretty good, one of our teachers, Mahbubul Amin, encouraged me to enroll at the Department of Graphic Design.” Mohammad Eunus worked on many projects with renowned artist Alakesh Ghosh. He received the best award in Graphic Design when he was a third-year student. He also received the best award in Painting when he was a fourth-year student, competing with the students of Drawing and Painting Department, and in his fifth-year, he won the Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin Best Award in Painting. After completing courses in fine art, he joined Bangladesh Television and married Riffat Eunus, who was a student at the Department of Ceramics, FFA, DU. Their son Ragib Yasar Mohammad Eunus is a computer science engineer. Mohammad Eunus has exhibited his artworks in five solo shows and went to Japan to study art on a scholarship. “Before going to Tama Art University in Japan, I did realistic paintings. But I was not satisfied with what I was doing. My interactions and internal exchanges with the canvas were not appeased and I switched to abstract paintings,” he added. Renowned Japanese painters Miyazaki Susumi and Toshio Gi Tanaka were his guides in Japan. For him, the essence of the rhythm of poetry, the melody of classical music and the visual beauty of abstract paintings are the same. He thinks surrealistic poems, especially those composed by Jibanananda Das, Indian classical music and abstract paintings are nearly identical. The painter has been depicting abstract, semi-abstract and pure-abstract works for over four decades. He employs colours, lines and textures to give his paintings a classical character. “Pursuing art is a solemn perseverance. It’s a meditative worship that ultimately leads one to the realm of spirituality. A strong passion for art is imperative to become a great artist,” says Eunus. The artist tries to express the inner feelings, elements and incidents of nature through his paintings. “Nature calls out to me at a deep level. My ‘Wall’ series is such an example. A wall evolves like a society; and sometimes we deliberately mess with it. We throw paint at it, hit it, damage it and then, we try to cure it. Society heals, leaving scars. My ‘Wall’ series endeavours to capture those healing walls,” he asserts. “My painting is a journey without any destination. I converse with the canvas in a meditative way when I start painting, playing with lines, colours, textures, themes and proportions.” He likes the works of Antoni Tàpies and Anthony Claps. He regards Mohammad Kibria as the abstraction guru, the father of modern art in Bangladesh. Mohammad Eunus has many national and international awards to his credit, including the Grand Award in Japan and an honourable mention award in Asian Art Biennale Bangladesh. His artworks are in the collection of the British Museum, Fukuoka Art Museum in Japan, and many private museums around the world.

Contemporary art gallery Shilpangan is hosting a two-week long solo art exhibition titled \" Greedom\" and Free Faces by Denmark-based Bangladeshi artist RA Kajol. Eminent writer and critic, Professor Syed Manzoorul Islam inaugurated the exhibition on March 15. Kajol is an artist known for creating works that focus on innovative ideas and social commitments. He came into the limelight with his colony series. Subsequently, he worked on different painting series including - Imbalanced World, Violence, National Flag, Song of Loneliness, Cold Fire, Democrazy, Oil Head and more. In the exhibition, he showcases the dialectical relationship between freedom and greed in his series “ Greedom ”. In the Free Faces series, the artist depicted the visages of people unknown to him. A distinct rhythm and a free flow of colours are the prime traits of the series. “We achieved freedom, but we are not free from our greed, which is why, the exhibition is titled \" Greedom \",” said the artist. “I have tried to experiment with colour plates, using it as my brush to spontaneously portray the Free Faces series. I have also used the edge of the plate to create sharp thin lines.” The exhibition is open from 3 pm to 8 pm daily and will conclude on March 28.

{"title": "Re-reading Ritwik Ghatak’s ‘Ajantrik’ | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. “What does Ajantrik mean? I don’t know, and I believe no one at the Venice Film Festival knew either. I cannot tell the whole story of the film. There was no subtitle for the film. But I saw the film spellbound till the very end,” film critic Georges Sadoul had said these words after watching Ajantrik. I had a déjà vu moment as I walked into the Subir Choudhury Exhibition Hall of Bengal Shilpalay. From Subodh Ghosh’s formidable literature, Ritwik Ghatak’s reels to the white space of the gallery, the man-machine relationship has always been a bewildering concept. Curator Zihan Karim intended to experiment with the unprejudiced affair, and reread the film from multiple angles. He shared his concept with a group of artists, architects, theater artistes, and the resultant is a beautiful conversation on the walls of the gallery. An understanding of the human condition where logic meets imagination and judgement meets sentiment was, therefore, a captivating experience. Ghatak’s Ajantrik is a popular film among most Bengali families. However, the concept of rereading a film within a gallery space, is rather unheard of. Much like the absence of the subtitle, the names of the artists and the artwork could not be found, other than on the gallery map. The subtle treatments made the exhibition a perfect tribute to the master filmmaker. The gallery is a wonderland with the smallest theater performance by Fame, an interactive video installation by Fahim Hasin Sahan, a monumental installation by Eshita Mita Tonni, Three Channel Video, photo montage, and installation by Razib Datta, Video installation by Palash Bhattacharjee, One Channel Videos by Hassan Mamun, Kumar Biswas and Munem Wasif. My personal favourite, however, was Munem Wasif’s Machine Matter. A One Channel Video set in an abandoned jute factory. The close shot of the thumping chest of the man while the machines stood still readily, reminded me of the scene from the film where Bimal loads stones and has a heated conversation with Jogoddal in the rickety 1920’s vintage Chevrolet Jalopy. The machine, instead of going forward, runs back. Bimal, with utmost anger, calls the car Lohar Bachha. Munem Wasif’s film expressed similar conversation through silence. The dichotomy is, however, seen in Razib Datta’s work. The pixelated characters were the way emphasise that logic and emotions maybe separate entities. He juxtaposes the oriental Boraq with Gogh’s Starry Night giving a third concept. It is from a series where the artist practices cinematic montage concept. As a whole, the concept of film reading in this manner was an interesting experience. Just like the master filmmaker would say, “Bhabo bhabo, bhabar practice koro” (Think, rethink, and practice thinking). A visit to the exhibition, which runs till August 3, will certainly be worthwhile.

Farzana Islam Milky is a sculptor, who sees the human figure in a variety of activities and environments. Her sculptures tell stories of people and their relationships with each other and the environment. Daily activities of human life, interactions between people and nature and people in manmade architectural settings are the subjects of her sculptures. The actions and gestures of the human figure show her interest in the human form, which she depicts not in its details, but in an impression of its movement. Her narratives create an effect that is not dramatic but more like a moment caught in time. They are filled with the tension of being caught in the middle of an act, the end of which we are left to imagine. She deals with the ordinary things, trying to capture a significant moment in the flow of life. The balanced movement of the figures shows her grasp of the basic language of sculptures. Milky's narratives of common activities of human life show her understanding of the medium and her sensitivity to the language of sculptures. The exhibition will run till April 19.

{"title": "Saleem’s ‘Speed of Color’ showcases mysticism and spirituality | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. New York-based Bangladeshi artist Khurshid Alam Saleem’s solo exhibition , Speed of Color, opens today at the contemporary art gallery, Shilpangan, in Lalmatia. Renowned academic and art writer Professor Nazrul Islam will inaugurate the show. Poet, architect and critic Rabiul Husain will preside over the opening ceremony. The internationally acclaimed artist’s paintings carry his signature style. He is fond of experimenting with new-fangled shapes and techniques in his works that predominantly contain collages. The artist directly pastes pieces of colourful fabrics on canvases, which appear more vibrant and lively in their slightly cracked surfaces. The sturdy brushstrokes, vivacious colours, assorted lines, columns, long and short bars, oval and round shapes, dots, various symbolic configurations and textures that Saleem uses are meant to evoke feelings, sensations and a relationship between human beings and nature. “I try to converse with nature. The nature that surrounds us is an endless source of beauty and mystery. I find inspiration in the finest details of nature, like a drop of rain, foliage or a fragment of white in the blue sky,” he explains. “Such elements contain new stories and invitations for me to embark on different journeys.” Saleem regards strong colour as the most significant means to articulate his feelings and sensitivities. Most of his works explore layers of colours and their simplistic reflections of nature. As a pure abstract expressionist, Saleem, who has been living in the USA for the last 33 years, concentrates on geometrical forms with various angles and compositions in which blazing crimson, emerald green, bright yellow and soothing sapphire are applied in thick overlapping layers. He symbolises nature, with surging colours like ash, azure, white, shades of chocolate-brown and light purple. Large and tiny bars, circles, dashes and round shapes, merging into each other, signify the seasons in Bangladesh. Black and white textures add to the drama of the compositions. His works pulsate with highly coloured and tangible tones that evoke mysticism and spirituality. Bangladeshi abstractionists are quite inspired by the works of eminent master Mohammad Kibria, who once said to Saleem, “Many imitated my style but you excelled in your artistic efforts.” Ed McCormack, one of the original contributing editors of Andy Warhol’s Interview, has written extensively on art and popular culture for Rolling Stone, The Village Voice, New York Daily News and numerous other publications. He has also praised Saleem’s skills as an artist. Saleem worked as the model for Jagrata Chourangi, the first sculpture based on the Liberation War of Bangladesh, created by Abdur Razzaque in 1973. He is conscious about the art movements in different parts of the world. The opportunity to tour many countries for his solo and group shows and visiting many art galleries and museums has allowed Saleem to closely explore the works of many masterful painters across the world. He feels that New York has given him many opportunities to explore himself. He stated that noted painters such as Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman and Hans Hofmann inspire him. Saleem’s works have been displayed with the likes of Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali, Francisco Goya, Mark Chagall and others in Vienna in 2010 and 2011. He received a number of prestigious awards including the Olympic Medal and Torch as an invited artist from the USA at the Beijing Olympic 2008. Speed of Color, opening from 3 pm to 8 pm daily, concludes on August 7.

People were displaced as a result of it. The palace of the Chakma king, buried deep in the lake, is also a part of the exhibition, along with a 'chair', the symbolic representation of the throne that travels around communities. At times, the chair sits alone in the landscape, which is constantly under threat by the majority.

Samsul Alam Helal is a visual artist based in Dhaka. He completed his graduation in photography from Pathshala South Asian Media Institute. Helal loves to make fiction to question the reality. His aim is to go beyond the socio-cultural and political issues which primarily interest him. He explores identity, dreams, longings and play with the psychological realm of these issues to understand the deeper marks they create. In his recent art practice he does photography, video and installation. Helal's work represents a reality in an alternate space. Helal is one of the winners of The World Press Photo Joop Swart Masterclass in 2016 and participated in various group shows including Kunsthalle Zurich, Speak Local, 2017, Colombo Art Biennale 2016, Dhaka Art Summit 2016, Chobi Mela 2012 and Bronx Museum, New York 2015.

A painting exhibition is underway at International School, Dhaka (ISD), showcasing artworks created by their students. The exhibition will run till February 16, and is open to the ISD community only. Since ISD follows the International Baccalaureate curriculum, their approach to education is a holistic one with a strong emphasis on the creative arts. Students are not only encouraged to take part in visual and performing arts, but also taught to put art education at the centre of all their academic activities. For example, their lessons on colour theory and positive and negative space impact their presentation skills in science and broaden their creative abilities in language. They are also able to approach mathematics from a new angle. The participating students, ranging from grade 6 to 10, were given a central theme to explore and then submit their final projects in the medium of their choice. Subjects such as identity through a pop cultural lens, narrative responses to global issues and still life are covered by the participants. As a principle, ISD imparts to its younger students the basic skills and techniques of drawing and painting. As they gradually progress, the students are allowed more freedom to explore their particular areas of interest and are not restricted within any one medium. From acrylics, watercolour, pencil to digital art and clay, the students are free to find their tool of choice to express themselves. The students, at an initial stage, are allowed to copy from the works of masterful artists as they can be a part of an important learning experience, provided that proper references are given. Students also maintain an art journal, in which they document their processes of creation, thoughts and inspirations. ISD does not only focus on art-making in the classroom, but aims to give their children a broader experience by exhibiting their artworks, taking them to art galleries and equipping them with the skills to critique their own work and the work of others. Many students from the institution go on to pursue art and creative fields in their later education.

The Santhal society is marked by diverse festivals and ritualistic celebrations of life with the changing course of nature. The serpentine beauty of rivers, farmland, ferry ghat, resting boats, the idyll of Santhal village and the cattle house are marked by the artistic compositions and transparent colour treatment by Suman. In many of his paintings, the artist fantastically mingles hues of ultramarine blue with burnt sienna, sap green and yellow to depict elements of nature. The exhibition, featuring 32 watercolour paintings, will run till May 4.

{"title": "'Surface as Symbol' held at Alliance Française de Dhaka | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The seventh solo art exhibition by artist Kazi Sayed Ahmed titled Surface as Symbol has begun at La Galerie, Alliance Française de Dhaka. The inaugural ceremony of the exhibition was held on Friday, August 31, 2018. Eminent artist Monirul Islam graced the occasion as the chief guest. Reaz Uddin Al-Mamoon, Managing Director, Epyllion Group, and Dewan Sayeedul Hassan, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges also attended the inaugural ceremony. Kazi Sayed Ahmed has always been infatuated with extraneous materials. As an artist seeking to inscribe new meaning into the surface, he has developed a signature stratagem of employing jute hessian to refer back to 'life'. Without resorting to verisimilitude, he is now able to align the painted space with the space that lies outside. At one point in his life, Ahmed explored the coexistence of representational elements and evacuated the surface area of the painting. If he showed an apparent allegiance to academic realism in his representation of the real elements, he also treated the surface as a positive field of vision, which is considered as negative space in the academia. Over the last five years or so, he has moved on to a higher plain — he is now inclined to make the best use of his arsenal. His 'surface' now appears as if it is the 'field of action', rather than the visualisation. Articulating their distance from the reality and lived experiences, his surfaces are more layered, and are freighted as symbols of lost time and of disappearing nature. There are around 12 artworks in mixed media are in display for this exhibition. The exhibition will be open to all till Wednesday, September 14, 2018.

The Embassy of Sweden in Bangladesh, in collaboration with the UN Women Bangladesh, hosted a photography exhibition titled, Swedish Dads and Bangladeshi Babas recently at Zainul Art Gallery, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka. The exhibition showcased 47 photos in total, 25 of which were taken by Swedish photographer Johan Bävman along with 22 photos of Bangladeshi fathers, selected from a process that involved a call for photos from all over Bangladesh. The event started with Charlotta Schlyter, Ambassador, Embassy of Sweden in Bangladesh, welcoming the audience with a speech. “I hope to inspire more men to begin reflecting on their roles as fathers and partners, which is an important step towards a more gender-balanced society,” she said. Her welcome address was followed by another speech by Shoko Ishikawa, Country Representative, UN Women Bangladesh, where she elaborated on the discriminatory gender issues. “UN Women believes that engaging men in the discussion on gender equality and having dialogues with them to break gender stereotypes and turning them into advocates of change is the best way forward,” she stated. “Through the 'He For She' initiative and through events such as this, we want to have more engaging discussions with men, going forward.” A panel discussion was also organised, where Anders Öhrström, Counsellor and Head of Development, Embassy of Sweden in Bangladesh, Naveed Mahbub, standup comedian and Zaheen Islam, Category Head of Hair Care at Unilever Bangladesh, spoke about parental leave for men and its necessities.

Paying homage to renowned sculptor and painter Syed Abdullah Khalid, Bangladesh National Museum (BNM) is hosting a ten-day retrospective exhibition, at their Nalinikanta Bhattashali Gallery. Renowned folklorist Professor Shamsuzzaman Khan, the chairman of the Board of Trustees of BNM, inaugurated the event. Eminent architect-poet Rabiul Hussain, an honourable member of the Board of Trustees of BNM, presided over the opening ceremony, and National Professor Anisuzzaman was present as the chief guest. Khalid’s wife Umme Kulsum demanded the inscription of the artist’s name at the base of the sculpture, Aparajeyo Bangla, at the event. Khalid’s Aparajeyo Bangla, carries a symbolic value and sentiment. It is a great piece of evidence of the glorious history behind the Liberation War of Bangladesh. Rabiul Hussain, who was involved in the making of Aparajeyo Bangla, called it Khalid’s most iconic sculpture. “The freedom fighters’ maverick character, resolute morale and indomitable courage attributes a unique feature of the work,” he said. Eminent sculptor Hamiduzzaman Khan and prominent art critic Moinuddin Khaled also spoke at the programme. In his speech, Moinuddin Khaled proposed the publication of a commemorative book on Khalid. The exhibition showcases sculptures and paintings, along with memoirs of the artist’s personal collection of watches, glasses, coins, collectibles, paint brushes, photographs, videos and his awards like the Ekushey Padak and Shilpakala Padak. Khalid, a pioneer in the field of art, beautifully merged the contrasting hard and soft aspects of artistic practices throughout his life. The vivid colours of spring flowers, especially Sonalu,Radhachura and Krishnachura, are prominent in his works. His paintings are picturesque, and inspired by observations of nature. The artist used close-up views of tree branches, containing patches of colourful flowers, and then distorted the paintings by splashing colour pigments. Khalid’s paintings generally denote romantic notions. As an abstract expressionist, his focus was on colours and their various facets. He also experimented with unstructured forms and vague compositions, which were scrupulously used in his works. The artist applied colours directly, piling up thick and thin layers on the canvas, for his bold and dynamic paintings. Strong brushstrokes make unintentional textural states in his works. At times, he deliberately created a texture, according to the paintings’ distinctive requirements. This application aspect is a hallmark of all his creations. The exhibition is open to all until November 13.

{"title": "'A Thousand Tales' in review | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The second round of the group art exhibition titled, A Thousand Tales , concluded yesterday at Drik Gallery, Dhanmondi. Organised by the students of artist and teacher Ripon Kumar Das, the invigorating exhibition showcased 79 artworks by a total of 22 young and aspiring artists. The most commonly used medium on the works was acrylic on paper. There were also some watercolour paintings, charcoal sketches, oil pastel drawings and woodcarvings. Speaking to the participating artists made it apparent that the art classes influenced them not only to the extent of obtaining the skills and honing their craft, but also in putting form to their imagination and inspiration. While the styles and subject matters of some of the works spoke of youth, the thoughts behind them were quite mature. Raima Rahman, one of the organisers of the event, explained that the exhibition is relevant because it is important for people to see what the young generation has to say. The students explained that the structure of their art classes are free-flowing and creatively stimulating, with adequate freedom given to them to test out where their passion lies in art. Apart from drawing and painting, the classes include conversations about a wide range of topics including art history, religion and politics, all of which become a significant part of the art making process. For young artist Arafat Ahmed Ali, art is a way to learn about everything else. “Art is not only about putting paintbrush on canvas. Each subject and composition requires research and in-depth study, whether it be biology - when it comes to drawing a frog - or human emotions,” he said. On the other hand, artist Fiaz Rahi Khan said that one of his inspirations lies in the power of a painting in which a person's face can speak of their history. Among the artworks on display, many showcased an interesting use of acrylics to create texture and lighting. Some common subjects included Dhaka's fish markets, natural landscapes, portraits as well as surrealistic concepts influenced by contemporary styles. One notable work was Buoyancy by Mahira Rashid that showed the streets of Old Dhaka painted in monochrome with a man holding a bunch of multi-coloured helium balloons. Masuda Khan Juti's Uber Epar Opar portrayed the artist's perceived difference between the decoration of Uber cars in Kolkata and in Dhaka. Arafat Ahmed's series titled Khushi included paintings of a piece of cloth, the first of which is fully white and clean. It went on to become dirtier with spots of black appearing with each use, till the last painting showed the cloth to be all but black with a small golden dot in its centre. He related it to the passage of time, as negativity piles onto one's life with age. The golden dot signified the little things which make our life beautiful and worth enduring all the pain.

Muzicraft Presents Native Artistry , an exhibition showcasing handmade craft products, woodwork, pottery, nokshi katha , jute work, artworks, as well as jewellery and beauty products, was held recently at Platinum Grand Hotel in Dhaka. The organisers were keen on highlighting unique products made by our local artisans that many may not be aware of. According to Muzicraft, much of the art of creating handmade products is fading due to the lack of sustainable business models. This event was an attempt to revive some of the near forgotten methods of production and traditional items that have its roots in Bangladesh's rich culture and heritage. For quite a few of the stall owners, it was their first time venturing into the physical space of buying and selling as there are many Facebook pages that carry out their small businesses online. Some of the businesses are family-run with wives, husbands and mothers-in-law all joining in on the craft and trade. Crafts and Colours is one such business that sells hand painted pots, pans, trays, trunks and many other items. They specialise in folk art, Mexican and Turkish paintings. Bridge Foundation, a community of deaf and mute people presented many artworks created by their members in a variety of media, including paintings on jute. Along with focusing on empowering their community, they also want to highlight eco friendly practices and products. Studio Raa exhibited beautiful hand painted sarees on Muslin. Run by a pair of Charukola graduates, the boutique works with themes of famous paintings such as The Mona Lisa and Starry Night which are delicately painted on fabric. According to them, art alone cannot be a means of survival in our country. Thus, they try to blend their love of fine arts with the more commercially viable medium of fashion. Other featured businesses at the event included popular household names such as Aranya and Manas Boutique, as well as Ribana, Bangladesh Pearls Musuem, Jophiel, Hems and Hues and Jothashilpo.

The American humour magazine, MAD, founded in 1952, will effectively be pulled from newsstands after the release of its 9th issue in August 2019. The magazine was widely imitated and influential, affecting satirical media, as well as the cultural landscape of the 20th century. It published satire on all aspects of life and popular culture, politics, entertainment, and public figures. MAD’s mascot, Alfred E Neuman is typically the focal point of the magazine’s cover, with his face often replacing that of a celebrity or character who is lampooned within the issue. With an objective to commemorate the influence MAD has had on cartoonists all over the globe, Unmad, Bangladesh’s premier humour magazine, has organised an exhibition titled, Tribute to Mad Cartoon, at Drik Gallery in Dhaka. Among other things, the exhibition comprises of double exposure art, hand-sketched and digital cartoons, glass paintings and figurines by both promising and established artists. The wonderful artworks feature a smiling Alfred E Neuman and Unmad’s cheeky mascot. Renowned cartoonist Ahsan Habib, the editor of Unmad, inaugurated the event on Friday, surrounded by colleagues and fans of all ages. Syed Rashad Imam Tanmoy and Morshed Mishu, Assistant Editors at Unmad, Mehedi Haque, Publisher of Dhaka Comics and Nasreen Sultana Mitu, the founder of Project Tiktaalik, were also present. “I remember buying copies of MAD in 1975, when I was in school. It was unlike anything that I had seen before. Unmad is hugely inspired by MAD,” said Ahsan Habib. “We even sent one of our copies to William Gaines, the publisher of MAD, in 1980. He was really appreciative of it.” Morshed Mishu believes that most people in Bangladesh came to know about MAD through Unmad. “The influence MAD has had on generations of comic artists is phenomenal. I am sad to see that it will not be published anymore,” he said. “We have arranged this exhibition to celebrate the legacy of MAD in the best way we can, through our art.” Mishu’s double exposure piece at the exhibition fuses Alfred E Neuman and the mascot of Unmad together. Cartoonist Arif Iqbal shared that Unmad plans to launch online editions, in addition to their printed ones, in the near future. “There are avid fans of Unmad both at home and abroad. We want to reach our audience outside of Bangladesh,” he told The Daily Star. The exhibition concludes today.

{"title": "'Us Women II' showcases fierce and soulful artworks | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Us Women II, an exhibition held at EMK Center in commemoration of International Women's Day, celebrates the ways in which the young artists of Bangladesh perceive womanhood and all that it entails. The brilliantly curated show includes artworks that are fierce and soulful at the same time. The exhibition includes the works of 26 artists that submitted to an open call for entries on social media. The first installment of this exhibition was hosted last year. The group exhibition consists of a harmony that binds the paintings together to tell a larger story. Every piece fits into a narrative that is diverse in the stories told and the imaginations to be interpreted. On a technical level, all the paintings maintain a consistency of high value. Artists using a broad range of media emphasise their perceptions through deft use of their skills. What also stands out in the exhibition is the vibrancy of the artworks, the loud colours that are used in producing highly pigmented artworks that grasp the attention of anyone entering the gallery. Surreal works, artworks inspired by Japanese prints and modern and stylistic takes on Bangladeshi folk art are displayed. By making a statement on the role of women in society in terms of the oppression they face, an artist depicts what it looks like for that role to be reversed. The dark painting, which portrays an eerie mood shows a woman in a red and green saree taking centre stage, as though all eyes are on her while she claims her rightful place in the society, with a crown atop her head. A sinister presence looms behind her, only the eyes and claws of which are made visible. Another artist with her painting titled, Breaking Free tells her story without needing the help of the title. In it, the figure of a woman, loosely painted in black and white seems to be crying in a cage which is mostly intact till it breaks into a shocking explosion of colours, implying that the woman's freedom exists in the skies, in the many hues of pink, blue and orange. The exhibition, which concludes tomorrow, succeeds in bringing new voices into the art scene of Dhaka as well as in the conversations surrounding womanhood and femininity.

He as also received many awards, both locally and internationally. He resided in Germany for several years. With little knowledge of the German language and culture, Rahman roamed around famous European museums, thinking about the legacy of Bangladesh’s art and his identity as an artist in the country. He went to Germany after falling in love with a German girl. But that love gradually waned with the passing of time. His artistic self revolted and he tried to appease it in a foreign setting without his friends and his beloved motherland. His paintings depict the mystic Bauls of Bangladesh, different forms of pat and sora a well as various other facets of Bangladeshi culture on tempera and oil on his canvas. The painting styles and experiences of eminent Bangladeshi artist Shahid Kabir and renowned Indian artist Ganesh Pyne also inspire the artist. With the outcomes of his artistic journey in Germany, Rahman arranged a month-long solo art exhibition, Bodyspace Mindscape , at Dwip Gallery in Lalmatia. Organised by 180 Degrees, the exhibition showcases 23 works completed by Rahman between 1989 and 1991.

Yesterday, Tipping Point Project of CARE Bangladesh organised an exhibition titled 'What Real Change Looks Like', a photographic experience, created by women of Photo-Voice at Six Seasons Hotel in Gulshan. The project works with young people and communities to change social norms and practices that perpetuate child marriage. To understand how their work has contributed to changes in the lives of many women, Tipping Point used 'Photo-Voice' as an evaluation tool. Young women, who had never used cameras before, shared their stories and perspectives through photography. The images captured for the programme are stunning glimpses into the lives of women and girls in Bangladesh, where child marriage is a daily reality.

{"title": "Whiny Women: A promising artistic initiative | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Whiny Women, a group art exhibition that aimed to create a space for women’s expressions, was held on January 4 and 5 at Dhaka Gallery, Banani. What began as a Facebook group called Women In Arts, Bangladesh (WIAB) for women creators around the country to share their works and form a community, manifested into an exhibition of paintings, sculptures, collages, and augmented realities. The curatorial team included a wide range of individuals, from students of social sciences to artists with degrees from fine art institutes. However, striking harmony in curating a group exhibition is always a delicate matter. “Privilege can be lonely. But what we do with the privilege is what matters at the end of the day,” said Pracheta Ahana, the founder of WIAB and the lead organiser of the exhibition. In her closing speech for the show, she acknowledged both the power and responsibility that comes with belonging to a certain socioeconomic class of the population, among which women are silenced to a relatively lesser degree. Rebelling against the various name-calling and humiliations inflicted towards women for merely being themselves, Ahana was encouraged to come together and create a space that would exist as a form of resistance and resilience. From a wall covered with surrealistic art prints for sale at BDT 500 to a painting of the cat whom the artist recently lost, an array of emotions, artistic styles and philosophies emerged at the show. Some paintings alluded to the horrifyingly common forms of female oppression, while others simply portrayed women in their various forms of feminine beauty. The age of consuming content by scrolling on our phones made its impact felt in the style and representation of many of the artworks, in which the artists combined their thoughts and poetry with pictures. While the artworks carried merit on their own, collectively, the show presented itself in fragments, rather than as a cohesive message. Over the recent years, there have been several youth-led art exhibitions and events, many of which turned the spotlight on social issues and causes. To that end, it is promising to see young creators come together to try and make a mark for what they believe in and what they are passionate about. Overall, the exhibition was well received by the audience. Hopefully, Whiny Women is the first of many initiatives that will not only give a platform to women’s voices, but will also strive to break barriers of oppression among the wider socioeconomic landscape of Bangladesh.

{"title": "Young artists address poverty through ‘Bhanga Ghor’ | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. According to the President of Cosmo Concepts, Edward William, and exhibiting artist and organiser, Aysha Mahmood, the idea of the exhibition grew out of the economic conditions, they as youngsters, saw all around them. The huge disparities and gaps that remain to be overcome in our society urged them to take action and create awareness in any way they could. “From being one of the poorest nations in the world before 1971, we have come a long way,” said William. “But we have further progress to make and we tried to highlight that in this exhibition.” The artworks included colourful illustrations that depict playfulness at first glance, but reveal inequalities and injustices upon closer inspection. For instance, in one of the artworks, a young boy was seen cleaning a car while another boy of similar age comfortably sat inside. There were skillfully crafted paintings in oil and acrylic that showed the darkness of deprivation. Around 30 artists, all handpicked by the organisers, exhibited in the show. Cosmo Concepts had posted an open call for artworks on Facebook and received submissions from aspiring artists of all ages working in different media. William also said that the title of the show was easy to decide, as a bhanga ghor, (broken home), tactfully conveys the themes of poverty and hardship. In the modern day, when there is a lot to feel hopeless about, Bhanga Ghor was a positive initiative, not only for the relevant theme but also because it was proof that the youth of our country are aware and are taking action. It is inspiring that they are choosing the arts as an avenue to bolster their causes, as the importance of creative outlets, especially for the youth, grows in its urgency with every passing day.

{"title": "700 TAKA: A quirky and charming tribute to young love | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. 'Relatable' - a label that every director wants on their project, while some others try their best to tag this to the most outlandish of genres. However, Nuhash Humayun's latest short on iflix, 700 Taka, is 'relatable' done right. As a director, Nuhash had already made his presence felt with Hotel Albatross and Paperfrogs , the latter of which bagged him the coveted 'Best Debut' award at The Daily Star- Standard Chartered Bangladesh's Celebrating Life 2017. In spite of that, I feel like the director outdid his previous works when he made this romcom. That too without even taking into account the plethora of memes on social media that has helped 700 Taka go viral. The 17 minute short features Pritom Hasan and Sabila Nur as the leads, both of whom showcase believable chemistry from the get-go. Pritom, even though not a professional actor, perfectly fits the role of Arik, an economically challenged and insecure youngster. He is arguably the highlight of the short, despite of the presence of the much more seasoned actor, Sabila Nur. The short film is shot primarily in two locations – the house where Arik tutors a plump young child and a well-known restaurant in Dhanmondi. The story is centered around Arik's date with Nadia (Sabila Nur), during which Arik is paranoid about having only 700 taka in his pocket. The cinematography by Tanvir Anzum is unconventional but fitting of the story. The humour of 700 Taka is pretty much in-your-face, but never to the point that it gets overbearing. The overabundance of television and pop-culture references only adds to the whimsical nature of the film. There is even a parody of a typical Bangla tele-fiction in the short, which made me laugh more than it realistically should. The segment between Arik and the unnamed waiter, played by none other than internet 'meme-lord' Asif Zaman deserves a special mention due to the sheer unadulterated humour that it brings to the film. At the end of the day, 700 Taka is unapologetically funny and surprisingly relatable, the reason being that it was made by an enthusiastic young crew for a young audience. Given that you can sign up to iflix for free and watch this for free, it is highly recommended for anyone looking for 17 minutes of brilliance by Nuhash Humayun.

{"title": "Akira Kurosawa - A Japanese filmmaking legend | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Akira Kurosawa is considered as one of the most prominent filmmakers in the history of cinema. The Japanese director and screenwriter, was endowed with profound creativity. What sets his work apart from the rest was his mastery in presenting the infinite grace of nature and the combative characteristics of human beings. Akira Kurosawa was born on this day in 1910. When Akira Kurosawa was still young, his elder brother Heigo Kurosawa took him to see the devastation caused by the 1923 Great Kanto earthquake; he witnessed rotting dead bodies and carcasses of animals and birds all around. This served as his indoctrination to the volatility of nature and human beings. Later in his career, these two elements reflected in many of his masterpieces. Kurosawa's mentor, director Kajiro Yamamoto left a lasting legacy with him - a good director must also excel as a screenwriter. Kurosawa followed it, and his films went on to become successful. Drunken Angel (1948) is considered to be his first film that became critically acclaimed, starring Toshiro Mifune, who went on to act subsequently in many more of Kurosawa's films. Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) was screened at the Venice Film Festival, where it won a Golden Lion (the highest prize given to a film at the festival) in 1951. Mifune's spectacular acting skills in the film, paired with the mesmerising portrayal of nature -- rain pouring in endless streams and sunlight escaping through the wooden canopy -- made it a work of art. Ikiru (1952) tells the story of a government official who, upon learning about his deadly cancer, seeks affection from his family but fails. Many film critics consider it to be one of the best films to have ever been made. Inspired from Hollywood's 'Western' films, the epic Seven Samurai (1954) ranks as one of Kurosawa's greatest commercially successful films. He used new techniques with long lenses, multiple cameras and wide screen. It had a wonderful effect on action shots. Kurosawa used these techniques for other films like Hidden Fortress, Throne of Blood, Red Beard and Ran . Akira Kurosawa's greatness far exceeded his counterparts'. Renowned American filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola once mentioned that most directors have one or two masterpieces by which they are known. But Kurosawa has at least eight or nine. The great filmmaker passed away on September 6, 1998.

Actress Azmeri Haque Badhon is now rumoured to have been approached by Indian director Vishal Bhardwaj for his upcoming project \"Khufia\", a production of Netflix. The film was earlier rejected by renowned Bangladeshi actors Bidya Sinha Mim and Mehazabien Chowdhury, due to the script allegedly showing Bangladesh in a bad light. Rumors are circulating that Badhon has even auditioned for the film. However, the actress neither confirmed nor denied anything regarding the subject. \"There is nothing I can actually say right now, there needs to be some actual development for me to comment on this,\" she said to The Daily Star over the phone. The recent offers by the team of \"Khufia\" does imply that director Vishal Bhardwaj and his crew are determined to hire local Bangladeshi talent for their project. Badhon has been in the limelight for the Abdullah Mohammad Saad directorial \"Rehana Maryam Noor\", the first film from Bangladesh to be selected in the main section of the prestigious International Cannes Film Festival.

There was a time when Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC) was packed with actors and technicians all day and night, filming movie scenes across the premises. But over time, circumstances worsened as fewer movies started being produced with every passing year and many movie theatres across the country got shut down. Nevertheless, the past week has broken the status quo as the BFDC grounds have been occupied by the cast and crew of two upcoming movies, which are being filmed simultaneously at the BFDC premises. Sections of the property have undergone unrecognisable transformations as they now host elaborate sets depicting cityscapes befitting the plotlines of the respective films. At the outdoor city location sets, director Zakir Hossain Raju is filming the upcoming Shakib Khan starrer, Moner Moto Manush Pailam Na, co-starring Bubly and Misha Sawdagar, among others. On the other hand, Nusraat Faria and Bappi Chowdhury starrer, Dhaka 2040, directed by Dipankar Dipon, is being filmed on two separate floors on the same grounds. Cast and crew aside, the sets are also full of fans and film enthusiasts gathering to catch a glimpse of their favourite actors behind the scenes.

As Queen were no strangers to huge stadium tours, the film, perhaps unsurprisingly, settles on their iconic 1985 Live Aid performance at Wembley for its centre-piece. Beamed live to 1.5 billion people worldwide, the concert helped to raise funds for the ongoing Ethiopian famine by featuring the biggest bands in the world. In the concert, it was Queen who arguably shone brighter than their illustrious company, including U2 and Elton John.

While there have been earlier reports of the number of movies dwindling each year, movie theatres continue to be places where people eagerly gather to catch the latest films. While Dhaka is the mainstream hub of the film industry, it makes one wonder how movie theatres fare outside the capital. Apart from Dhaka, Khulna, which is home to a wide range of cinema halls, is a popular destination for many film enthusiasts. One theatre that stands out from the rest is Shonkho Cinema Hall. Built 35 years ago, it is known as Khulna's oldest theatre. It holds a capacity of 1000 seats and has a spectacular interior. The theatre holds premieres alongside theatres in Dhaka. Amongst the recent releases is Debi, which was screened at Shonkho for three weeks. Another movie theatre situated in Prankendra is Sangeeta, which has been running for a long time, and is currently screening Shakib Khan's Super Hero. An employee working there stated that many Shakib Khan admirers come to the theatre to enjoy the film. However, he informed that business has dwindled considerably since its bustling era in the 1980s. “The cinema hall needs some improving, or else not everyone will be interested in coming here to watch movies,” commented one audience member. One other cinema hall at the heart of Khulna city is Society, which has grown to be abandoned over the years. The theatre is filled with archaic equipment, and old, outdated films playing on the screen. The oldest cinema hall to have stood the test of time is Liberty, now known as Liberty Cineplex. Built in 1956, the theatre houses 850 seats. Audience members around the theatre hold a deep appreciation for the establishment, stating that despite its age, it has managed to keep up with the times, making numerous enhancements along the way. Besides being one of the oldest movie theatres in Khulna, Liberty Cineplex is also the most innovative and modern. Khulna once boasted 20 theatre halls, out of which only 6 have survived. Shonkho, Sangeeta, Liberty Cineplex, Society, Chitrali, and Janata continue to thrive.

One of those fans, Meher Nigar Bhuiyan, a senior Programme Manager in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at the Australian High Commission, had read the novel at least 4-5 times in the past and believes that the makers behind Debi did justice to the story. “To be very honest, I was skeptical before going to the theatre,” said Meher Nigar. “But I left the theatre in awe of the film.

Dev Anand once told Dilip Kumar \" Lala, tu saw saal jiyega \"(Lala, [family name] you will reach the centennial mark!). Dilip Kumar turns 96 today. He was born as Muhammad Yusuf Khan to Ayesha Begum and Lala Ghulam Sarwar Ali Khan in a Muslim Hindko-speaking Awan family in Kissa Qhawni Bazar, Peshawar, in 1922. His father being a fruit merchant took his family to Bombay and settled there. As Yusuf Khan grew up to be a good- looking young man he started taking interest in cinema and went to Bombay Talkies. The cine star of the time, Dewika Rani, took his interview and the star Dilip Kumar was born. His debut was in the film Jwar Bhata (1944), and he went on to become a cine icon with an acting career spanning six decades and 65 films. Films like Andaz, Aan, Naya Daur, Devdas, Madhumati, Ganga Jumna and Shakti are some of his most memorable films. His performance in Tapan Sinha's Bengali film, Sagina Mahato, was remarkable. Satyajit Ray termed Dilip's métier as method acting. In Ganga Jumna where Ganga (Dilip) was on the run chased by police he crumpled at the feet of Dhanno (Vyjayantimala) and poured out in agony \"Unho ne mujhe ghar se beghar kar diya\" (they have hounded me out of my house). It became one of the classic scenes of Indian cinema. In Devdas, Dilip was immaculate in his portrayal of the brooding persona of Devdas. Vyjayantimala, Chandramukhi of Devdas, informs that once she found Dilip walking around the studio briskly, perspiring with his face looking pale. In the next scene, she was to dance to the song, Jise Tu Qubool Karle, with Dilip lounging on the bed with a melancholy look. There, he conveyed the impression that Sarat Chandra indeed wrote Devdas with Dilip in mind! Dilip Kumar shone brightly in the films he acted in. Many happy returns of the day to the icon!

{"title": "Exploring claustrophobia in cinema | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Many filmmakers have grasped the idea of plausible horror stories, opening doors to numerous subgenres to explore. For nearly two years, we have faced one form of horror in our real lives with the advent of the global pandemic. It is the horror of being locked indoors for an undefined period of time. Psychologists refer to a terrifying experience of this sort as 'claustrophobia'. While I have spent a large chunk of my time during the pandemic at home binging on films, the types of films that I can relate to now more so than ever are horror films centered around the feeling of claustrophobia, which can distinctly be identified as the films where the protagonist is either physically or mentally trapped in an unpleasant environment through the majority of the film's runtime. A well made horror film of this subgenre can take the on screen anxiety felt by the protagonist and bring it off the screen permeating itself throughout the viewing experience of the audience. This article explores three excellent examples of claustrophobia. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) 'What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?' is a 1960s claustrophobic thriller/horror film which established an archetype for many great books and films across generations to come. The movie stars two legendary actors Bette Davis and Joan Crawford who play siblings with hints of deep-rooted rivalry between them. After an unfortunate accident leaves Blanche Hudson (played by Crawford) confined to a wheelchair, she is forcefully kept isolated by her sister Baby Jane Hudson (played by Davis), who has always been jealous of Blance's success in the film industry. According to many documentaries, interviews and other historical accounts, these two veteran actresses hated each other in real life. Their off-screen rivalry makes the interplay between the characters on screen feel very realistic. Any good piece of cinema is bound to bring out certain emotions from the audience, and this is where the film outshines most other stories of this subgenre. The entire story, with its intricate twists and turns brings out a multitude of emotional reactions from the viewers. If you watch this movie at a stretch, the little over two hours of runtime will give you feelings of empathy, anxiety, hatred, and ethical dilemma alongside its primary trigger point, i.e. claustrophobia. What the director Robert Aldrich was able to do in the early 1960s with a modest budget is remarkable, as it ticks all the right boxes of a suspense-filled experience. Misery (1990) 'Misery', which is adapted from a novel by Stephen King, is an epitome of a good claustrophobic horror. The film is directed by Rob Reiner at the peak of his career as a filmmaker. The film tells the story of romance novelist Paul Sheldon (played by James Caan) who has just come off completing his long term pot-boiling novel series. These popular series of books of his revolved around a girl named Misery Chastain. In the opening of the film, Sheldon is seen to have just completed typing the manuscript to his new standalone novel, at the serene and secluded Colorado Lodge. On his way back to the publishers, he ends up being caught in a blizzard and crashing his car in a remote, snow covered mountainous area. This is where he is rescued by a woman named Annie Wilkes (played by Kathy Bates) who introduces herself as Sheldon's \"number one fan\". Annie starts out as a friendly and hospitable character with the noble intention of nursing Paul back to health. However, as the story progresses we are introduced to a darker and more sinister side of her, especially after she learns that Paul killed off her favorite character Misery Chastain in the newly published final installment of the novel series. Annie holds him captive in her cabin keeping him sick by various means and forcing him to write a follow up novel in order to reincarnate the Misery character. Although James Caan gives off a wonderful performance, the highlight of this film is Kathy Bates' academy award winning portrayal of Annie Wilkes. Through the role she impeccably portrays Annie as a person of psychopathic tendencies in the form of an obsessed fan. The vivid portrayal of the multiple personality disorder of Bates' character can be seen through her transitions from an amiable smile to a rather Mephistophelian grin. Ardent fans of Alfred Hitchcock may notice various aspects of the direction and cinematography of the film emitting an eerie vibe, similar to that of Hitchcock's films. Overall, this film has the likes of being on the top 10 list of many horror/thriller fans and it is perhaps one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel put to film. Run (2020) Perhaps the most emotionally exhausting film on my list is the amazing film 'Run', which was directed by Aneesh Chaganty. What makes the storyline more difficult to digest is the fact that the victim in captivity in this film is being kept isolated by her own mother. Chloe, who has been confined to a wheelchair for as far back as she could remember becomes suspicious of her mother who never lets her communicate with the outside world. The character of the mother in this film is played by Sarah Paulson, who is known for taking up antagonistic roles, which the audiences love to hate. Paulson's portrayal of the mother in this film with her borderline psychopathic obsession of keeping her daughter secluded from connecting to any person or institution beyond the confinement of their house is a testimony to the fact that she is a veteran in playing roles of this sort. The desperation and helplessness of the character Chloe throughout the film feels painful and realistic. This has much to do with the fact that the actress Kiera Allen, who plays the role of Chloe, uses a wheelchair as she suffers from a paralysis in real life. Hence, it is undeniable that she plays this particular character with extreme finesse and realism. The plot of the film clearly draws inspiration from its long list of predecessors, including films like 'Misery' which I also covered in this article. The film clearly learns from all of the past claustrophobic horrors/thrillers of this sort and incorporates all of the best elements in terms of its choices of storytelling, direction and cinematography.

It is certainly intriguing how the significance of the number 52 is rather relevant in this project. “February is a month of festivities for Bangladeshis, with celebrations including Pahela Falgun, Valentine's Day, and most importantly, the International Mother Language Day,” added Tauquir Ahmed. “Keeping all that in mind, the film was scheduled for release this month.” Under the banner of Impress Telefilm Limited, starring Tisha and Siam together for the first time, Fagun Hawai will focus on the struggles of the era, along with the love that kindles between the two. Bollywood actor Yashpal Sharma ( Lagaan ), also plays an imperative role as a Pakistani police officer in the film. The film will also feature Abul Hayat, Afroza Banu, Fazlur Rahman Babu and Shaju Khadem among others. Fagun Hawai is an adaptation of the book by Tito Rahman titled, Bou Kotha Kou . The director will have a rather busy schedule today, as he, along with a few of the cast members are set to visit the renowned movie theatre, Balaka in the morning.

With the steady decline in the number of active movie theatres over the years, the number of films being produced also took a nosedive over the years. However, film stars have managed to keep themselves busy, venturing into an array of sectors within the entertainment industry. While some of them are busy acting in tele-fictions, others are exploring the world of television commercials. However, one major creative outlet that is gaining momentum with film stars is live stage performances. In recent months, film actress Popy has been performing in stage shows quite regularly. Just a few days ago, she returned from a live performance in Tangail. “I believe stage performances give the audience opportunities to experience their favourite stars live and also entertain them thoroughly.” said Popy. On the other hand, popular silver screen face Purnima has been away from films for some time but regularly performs on stage, apart from acting in commercials and television dramas. She recently performed at a show in Narsingdi. She is also reportedly returning to the silver screen with two movies, which she is filming this year. Shakib Khan, arguably Bangladesh’s biggest film star, is busy throughout the year with both movies as well as live performances, at home and abroad. Similarly, actor Ferdous is also busy shooting for his films and doing stage performances, especially in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India, where majority of his fanbase lies. Actress and model, Bidya Sinha Saha Mim has been keeping up with a packed schedule of filming and performing live as well. She performs on stage regularly both in Bangladesh and abroad. She recently returned from Bogura after a successful stage performance. For many actors in Bangladesh, it has become difficult to find enough work in films to sustain themselves financially, but according to a confidential source, their demand remains high for stage performances amongst Bengali audiences all year round.

The tales that our Kabi Guru, Rabindranath Tagore weaved, be it long or short stories, are glorious in their own right. Even though the stories were written a while ago, they still maintain readability for today’s audience. Even though a plethora of tele-fictions exist that are based on his works, not too many film adaptations of his stories have been made in Bangladesh. Chashi Nazrul Islam, one of the most renowned directors of Bangladesh, made two films following Rabindranath’s fictions. They are: Shasti and Shuva. Shasti features Purnima, Riaz, Illias Kanchan and Champa among others. It is based on the very popular short story of the same name by the Kabi Guru. Directed in 2004, Riaz and Purnima’s chemistry was praised by critics and audience alike. In 2006, Shuva was acknowledged for being a wonderfully crafted story about a young mute girl, also played by Purnima. The King of Dhalywood, Shakib Khan, played opposite Purnima in the film. Although both actors were lauded for their performance, Purnima’s work was among the best in the industry that year. Kabuliwala, directed by the acclaimed Kazi Hayat, was an adaptation of one of Rabindranath’s most moving short story of the same name. In the film, legendary actor Manna played the ‘Kabuliwala’, while wonder-child Dighi played the little girl. Obujh Bou, directed by Nargis Akhtar, was adapted from the story Shamapti by the Kabi Guru. Ferdous, Shakil Khan, Nipun and Babita were cast in the well-received film. Besides the ones mentioned above, two films were made from Rabindranath’s stories, but he was never given credit. The films were inspired from Noukadubi and Khudito Pashan.

As today marks the legend’s second death anniversary, here is what some of his close associates wish to share. Samrat: Not a day goes by that I do not miss my father. His absence left a void that can never be filled. It is heartwrenching when I wake up and cannot call out to my father any more. Our home is incomplete without him. All his belongings are there, but he is not. I always remember him in my prayers, especially today. Babita: It is impossible to forget an actor like Razzak. We truly miss his absence. Zahir Raihan introduced both of us to the film industry. When I first saw him at our home in Gandaria, I ran and hid in the fridge, and later was taken out. I first acted alongside him as a young actor in Shongshar, where I played his daughter. Later on, I starred as the female lead opposite him in the film, Shesh Porjonto. That film was a hit and the audience admired us as a pair. Ever since then, we starred in many films together. Razzak was like family to me. I still remember how I escaped to his home on my wedding night, out of tension. Only my closest companions knew about it. Later Razzak asked his spouse Lokkhi to take me back, and she did. I watch the films we did together when I miss him, and try to reminisce the good times we had. Shakib Khan: Nayak Ra j Razzak was one of a kind, hence his absence is felt immensely. He was there throughout the good and bad times of our film industry. He devoted his life to films. I want to share something today that not many are aware of. Whenever something delicious and hearty was cooked at Razzak’s house, they would invite me over. His wife is like a mother to me. I feel truly blessed that they treated me like their own child. Nayak Raj Razzak holds a special place in my heart. Rozina: It is indeed sad that Razzak is no longer amongst us. When I started my acting career, he was already a superstar by then. I was extremely nervous to act alongside him. He sensed the matter and comforted me. This act of kindness and understanding is certainly praiseworthy. After that, we have acted in many films together. I would like to say that he was a teacher in the truest sense. He showed the way to many newcomers, as well as various artistes of his time. Rarely have I seen such a dedicated individual in our film industry. I have utmost respect for Razzak and I miss him dearly.

Positive public reviews of the film surfaced on social media platforms immediately after its release. Looking into the film’s current progress, The Daily Star recently visited numerous cinema halls in Dhaka. So far, Kathbirali has received a lukewarm response at Ananda Cinema Hall, located in the heart of Farmgate. The first impression of the ticket counter for the matinee show of the film was disappointing. Only a couple of people were seen holding tickets to Kathbirali, at the venue. According to the managers, although the film attracted some cinemagoers during the weekend, the numbers went down as soon as the holidays ended. At Star Cineplex in Bashundhara City, the crowd for Kathbirali mainly consisted of youngsters. On the other hand, at Balaka Cinema Hall, the film is running quite well. It has managed to attract a significant number of cinemagoers. A couple of young film buffs, standing in a queue outside the hall, said that they came to watch the film because of positive word-of-mouth. Since its release, Kathbirali has performed quite poorly at Madhumita Cinema Hall. “Many cinemagoers have said that they liked the story of the film. However, a limited number of audiences are coming to watch it,’ shares Iftekhar Uddin Nawshad, the owner of the theatre.

He shares his thoughts on filmmaking, his insights on the film and more. Where did you shoot for 'Mr Bangladesh'? We have shot for the film all over Bangladesh, starting from Dhaka to Madhupur. It was a great experience. What are your expectations from the film? We have really high expectations from Mr Bangladesh and of course, we are hoping that it is well-received by the audience. We have shed our blood, sweat and tears behind this film. It is created with a lot of affection and honesty. What would you say is the core message of 'Mr Bangladesh'? The film tackles the very sensitive issues of terrorism and violence. Through it, we have attempted to convey that the majority of the Bangladeshi people are peace-loving individuals who will never support any kind of violence. How did you come about the script and why did you choose such sensitive issues as the central theme for the film? I lost Ishrat Akhond, a very dear friend of mine, in the Holy Artisan tragedy. Other than that, many people I have known over the years have fallen prey to terrorism. This is why I wanted to portray these issues in the film. I also feel an immense sense of responsibility as a filmmaker to tell stories that can educate the viewers and serve towards the betterment of our nation. Lastly, what can you tell us about the release of 'Mr Bangladesh'? The film will release on November 16. For a start, we will screen the film in 25 to 30 theatres and then add more shows eventually.

Although director Nuhash Humayun has a lot of accolades in his young career, one of the most unexpected ones is to have turned music director Pritom Hasan into a complete actor. Even though duo's extremely successful '700 Taka' indicated a presence of chemistry between the two, 'Khoka', released under the banner of Gaanchill Music, and is nothing short of a chemical explosion. In the star-studded video containing the likes of Ferdous Wahid, Siam Ahmed and Safa Kabir, Pritom outshines everyone with his eerie portrayal of a boy, who comes back to life as a zombie after an accident. Pritom's signature groove is omnipresent, but welcome is the addition of industry legend Ferdous Wahid's verses as the 'grim reaper', which has already grown on the urban masses. In essence, Khoka is a love story gone wrong in the worst way possible. There is charm amidst the horror, as Pritom can arguably be in line for being the 'most adorable zombie' award any time soon. Nuhash, as the director, leaves no stone unturned in making the music video a genuinely fun experience. World class props were used during the shoot, which added to the atmosphere drastically. There are easter eggs around every nook and cranny, none of which I will spoil for you. Siam Ahmed and Safa Kabir carry themselves like the stars that they truly are, and genuinely seem like they are enjoying their role in Khoka . All in all, Khoka is an impressive feat, a charming horror story put forth within 7 minutes for a light watch. If the cinematic and musical excellence can't draw you, 'Gojamil' being permanently included in Bangladesh's urban vocabulary just might.

{"title": "Leesa Gazi’s ‘Baarir Naam Shahana’ sheds light on a woman’s courage | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. British-Bangladeshi writer, director, actor and playwright, Leesa Gazi has dedicated her career to presenting powerful stories told from a woman's perspective via theatre and film. Her documentary film, \"Rising Silence\", memorialising accounts of Birangona women of the 1971 Liberation War, won several accolades across the world, including Best Feature Documentary at Moondance International Film Festival (USA), Asian Media Award for Best Investigation 2019 (UK), Best Feature Documentary at the PSVI Film Competition by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, UK. Since 2017, Gazi started working with Global Survivors Network, SEMA, established by Nobel Laureate Dr Denis Mukegwege's Foundation. The first-ever International public address by two Birangona women of Bangladesh, Anoara Begum and Jabeda Khatun, was made possible by Gazi's efforts. Begum and Khatun joined fellow survivors in an international call at the Hague in 2018 for global reparations schemes to address the consequences of rape as a weapon of war. Gazi is currently working on the Collective Memory Group at SEMA. Recently, she spoke to The Daily Star about her upcoming film, \"Baarir Naam Shahana - A House Named Shahana\", and more. \"Baarir Naam Shahana\", produced by your company, Komola Collective, is your first fiction film. How did you begin working on it? I wrote the story in 2011, and we began working on the film in October 2019. I narrated the story to my close friend and collaborator, Aanon Siddiqua, who plays the lead character in the film. We ended up writing the screenplay together. She is a singer and dancer and has also acted in a short film. She is currently doing her PHD on the complexities in developing an effective and sustainable legal framework that protects the creative and commercial interests of Bangladeshi Musicians. I am excited for the audience to see her performance in \"Baarir Naam Shahana\". Noted actor and writer Bipasha Hayat, a close friend of mine, gave us additional ideas that involve parts of this film to be shot in the UK. Seventy-five per cent of the movie has been shot in Bangladesh, and we will do the rest in the UK. Currently, we are looking for co-producers. The film is about a woman's right to choose to live her life on her own terms, and we would like to work with those companies or individuals who believe in this view. Our shoots were delayed on multiple occasions due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We only started filming in May of this year. The cast and crew were determined to do their best, despite the setbacks. We hope to start our UK shoots by the end of this year or the beginning of next year. Could you elaborate on the story of \"Baarir Naam Shahana\"? The movie is about a divorced woman named Dipa in 90's Bangladesh, who wants to have control of her own life, defying social stigma and building her own path to achieve her purpose. The film is about her journey through her pain, courage, desire, and fighting spirit to live her life the way she chooses. It has no special effects or gimmicks. The heart of \"Baarir Naam Shahana\" lies in its story. It will not be a sad, miserable film. Instead, it will be a triumphant one. You have worked with both newcomers and prominent artistes on this film. How was the experience? Alongside Aanon Siddiqua, the cast includes Amirul Haque Chowdhury, Jayanto Chattopadhyay, Naila Azad Nupur, Lutfor Rahman George, Iresh Zaker, Kazi Ruma, Kamrunnahar Munni, Wriddhi, Apon, and many local performers from Kushtia. I have a dream team including Xoaher Musavvir (Director of Photography), Mohammad Rafi Sumon (Associate Producer), Nahid Masud (Sound), Tania Rahman (Costume Designer), Alex Unai (Tech Head and On-location Editor), Sohini Alam and Oliver Weeks (Music Directors). They have all been remarkable to work with at such stressful and challenging times. Tell us about your personal journey with filming \"Baarir Naam Shahana\". How and why were you inspired to tell this story? More often than not, we have seen women's stories being told through the lenses of men. But is it possible for a man to comprehend the experience of being a woman truly? Being a divorcée myself in '90s Bangladesh, I experienced enormous social stigma and observed how divorced women were made outcasts in their homes and society in general. However, Dipa does not accept what is decided for her by others and fights to live her life as she aspires. I have seen women like Dipa too. Every female character in this film is familiar and relatable. We know or recognise them from our surroundings. They emerge from our homes, families, and neighbourhoods. You have collaborated with celebrated author Tahmima Anam for a play. What can you tell us about it? Our company, Komola Collective, commissioned Tahmima Anam to write a play entitled \"Shahrazad\". It is based on the eponymous character from Middle Eastern folk tales, \"One Thousand and One Nights\". Shahrazad is a woman who is married to a king, and on the wedding night, she tells a story to him but does not finish it, leaves it at a cliffhanger, as she is supposed to be killed at the end of the night. The king wants to hear the end of the story, but Shahrazad says he will have to wait until the next night to listen to the rest of it. Trapped behind high walls and closed doors, a woman must find tricks and tactics to divert her husband's growing anger each day to survive. The play is based on this theme, looking at the 'Shahrazads' of today. Tahmima Anam wrote an outstanding play with a modern approach dealing with this idea that worked superbly. Domestic violence peaked during the Covid-19 pandemic across the world, and as storytellers, we felt that we needed to address this issue urgently. For this project, we have spoken to survivors of domestic violence (DV) and their children and worked with different DV organisations. We look forward to bringing the play to the stage in 2022.

{"title": "Looking back at Satyajit Ray’s noteworthy films | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Yesterday marked the 98th birthday of Satyajit Ray. Akira Kurosawa spoke highly about his films. “It is the kind of cinema that flows with the serenity and nobility of a big river. In his films, people are born, live out their lives and accept their death without the least effort and without any sudden jerk,” he said. Ray was known for his humanistic approach to cinema. We take a look at some of his best films below. In Pather Panchali, we watch the family struggle over a period of years to get by and attempt to get out of the debts that hover over them. Sarbajaya does her very best to keep her kids fed and in line while Harihar seeks work and dreams of becoming a writer, someone the town respects and a man who can educate his son. While they manage to keep their spirits up in the face of great struggle, in the end the cycle of poverty only gets worse as death comes twice upon the family. First, Indir dies after being turned away by Sarbajaya, and then Durga dies of a horrible fever. Consequently, Sarbajaya breaks down in uncontrollable tears and Harihar gapes on in incredulous shock. Harihar lives out his life unrewarded yet quietly resigned to his life. He talks to Sarbajaya about his new prospects of a breakthrough . S he listens impassively with her face turned away to the earthen stove. Ultimately, Ray’s film shows the difficulty of poverty and the pain that it causes and how we should accept death when it comes. Ray’s Apu trilogy is known to be a breathtaking milestone in world cinema. Based on the short story Abataranika by Narendranath Mitra, Mahanagar, directed by Ray, explores the evolving independence of a middle-class woman, Arati Mazumdar, as she takes her first job because of increasing financial pressure. On the other hand, Charulata, which is considered as one of Ray’s finest films, tells the story of an educated and creative individual, who is curious about the ways of the world, but lacks an adequate platform to share her thoughts or a like-minded individual to converse with, on equal terms. Themes of loneliness, disconnect, trust, loyalty, and unspoken love are heavily explored in this film. Ray shifts his gaze to one of the greatest horrors in human history—the man-made famine of 1943 in Bengal, which claimed five million lives, in his film, Ashani Sanket (Distant Thunder). The story is set in a village where the people can sense an impending danger as the price of staple food rises, leading to starvation. Keeping Gangacharan (Soumitra Chatterjee) and Ananga (Babita) in the forefront, the film captures the gradual destruction of the structures in rural Bengal—from socio-economic to interpersonal. Ray shows the breakdown of traditional village norms, as hunger looms large over the society. With his brilliant storytelling and filmmaking, Ray truly carved a space for himself in the world of cinema.

{"title": "'Matir Projar Deshe' screened at Goethe-Institut | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Matir Projar Deshe (Kingdom of Clay Subjects) , directed by award-winning fiction and documentary writer, director and producer, Bijon, and produced by Arifur Rahman, was recently screened at Goethe-Institut, Bangladesh. Bijon, along with Arifur Rahman, participated in this year's Berlinale Co-Production Market with their feature project Paradise. The 16th Berlinale Co-Production Market took place during the 69th Berlin International Film Festival in Germany. After receiving international recognition, the team is now set to share their experiences and showcase their work in Bangladesh. Matir Projar Deshe began with a beautiful story of friendship between a ten-year old boy Jamal and his playmate Lokkhi. As the story moved forward, Lokkhi was forcefully married off. On her wedding day, Lokkhi, a child bride, tried to escape on her way to her in-laws. Lokkhi running across the paddy field, wearing a red saree, was one of the most visually striking scenes in the film. The director, during the concluding Q&A session, mentioned that this particular scene was inspired by his grandmother who similarly tried to run away on her wedding day. Instead of displaying the idealised resistant side of society, the film mostly showcased the real rural scenarios in Bangladesh. In the real world, society consists of all kinds of people. Keeping with that notion, the film featured characters that represented humanity in its truest essence. When Jamal's mother, Fatema's identity of being a former sex-worker was revealed and the entire village wanted to punish her, an Imam, came forward to help her. “Our hearts will be judged in the afterlife, not our bodies,” was the concluding line in the film by the Imam, which was refreshing to see.

The screening of Bidyabhuban- a Journey of Enlightenment at the Dhaka Lit Fest 2018 created quite a buzz about the Toronto based filmamaker, Nadim Iqbal. Iqbal's early plan was to study in a film school in Pune, which never saw the light of the day. However, while he was pursuing his degree in photography in Seneca College, he was introduced to a yearlong course in documentary and non-fiction filmmaking. Photography built the base of his visual expedition and his journey continued. “I prioritise human emotion and try to portray that in my films,” he explained. With exquisite photography of the natural beauty of the countryside of Bangladesh, his film tells a true story of a visionary named Sk Mamun, who transformed the lives of many underprivileged children by invoking their inner true potential. The protagonist, Mamun, devotes twelve years of his life meditating to find his inner self and later works towards his dream project on his return. “I was taken aback by the amount of people who came to watch the film. Many of them were sitting on the floor,” exclaimed Iqbal, who received an overwhelming response for the film. His first documentary Mother Tongue was made as the final project of his course. It achieved around 40 recognitions from all around the world till date. The film highlights the relationship of his children with their grandfather, eminent poet, Asad Chowdhury. Through the film he successfully conveyed the message about the importance of our mother language to the next generation.“The best reward for the film was my daughter reading Bangla books again,” smiled Iqbal. The social consciousness of Nadim Iqbal makes him standout in the crowd. Far away from his motherland, he retains pure emotion for his country and channels it beautifully through his work. “I'm still a novice in filmmaking but I shall learn in the process,” he concluded.

We have informed all the family members and with a saddened heart they have accepted that nothing less than miracle can get him out of this situation,\" the doctor said in a bulletin. Chatterjee, the doctor said, seems to not respond to the current therapies and \"his situation is really grave and critical\". On Friday, the neurological condition of the 85-year-old actor deteriorated and an EEG had shown that there is very little activity in the brain, the doctor had said.

{"title": "From Prematal to No Land’s Man | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. It is not every day that one is invited to Tahsan Khan’s home, even if it is for an interview. It was a cold night, and as the hours were slowly ticking by, one could hear someone covering Prematal from the outside, a hit number originally performed by Tahsan himself. “Must be a gaaye holud in the next building!” exclaimed Tahsan. Sure enough, the otherwise silent street was adorned with, not one, but three buildings with lights and decors, with blaring live covers by the glittery holud bands. “I have realised that when you are starting out in life, you always go out of your way to prove yourself,” pondered Tahsan. “Twelve to fifteen years ago, I was busy proving to the world that I could write hit numbers. Eight to ten years ago, I was busy proving my acting abilities.” In the early 2000s, not only had Tahsan Khan set out to become a famous singer, but had also gradually created a a place for himself in the television insuaret. Over the years, he evolved as an icon, where music and tele-fictions were concerned. Some of the TV fictions that he is still remembered for are Neel Pori Nilanjana by Shihab Shahin and Landphoner Dingulote Prem by Ashfaque Nipun, among many others. Today, he is one of the most sought after artistes for his talents as an actor, a singer and a musician. “I spend my time now thinking about the people and organisations who have, in one way or another, helped me reach this point of success in my life,” says Tahsan. “That is what my recent social media post was all about. The year 2019 has gifted me with so many positive activities. I tried to highlight some of them, if not all. From adventure filled corporate endorsements at exotic locations to cause related campaigns on bullying, from taking a walk down the memory lane with the original Black members at The Daily Star office for an interview to making memories with my daughter, from performing at different parts of the world to shooting my first English feature film - this past year was amazing, thanks to my family, friends, fans, big brands I work with and fellow journalists like you.” With the help of UNHCR, Tahsan had also visited the Rohingya camps in 2019, where he tried to learn and understand the conditions of an entire community who are now living as refugees in Ukhia. Tahsan was the highest tax paying artiste in the country in 2019. “Gone are the days when opting for a music or film career was considered taboo,” he says. “Today, you have ways and pathways to do what you love to do and make a decent living as well. When I pay tax, it helps the country, in turn, helping me and others like me. Yes, it is a slow process, but the wheels have begun to roll. I dream to see a Bangladesh where artistes will be able to fend for themselves in times of crisis and I believe this dream will soon be true!” 2019 has also been special for Tahsan because of No Land’s Man. The upcoming film, written and directed by internationally acclaimed filmmaker Mostofa Sarwar Farooki, deals with identity, spanning over three continents. Starring critically awarded actor and one of the top actors in the world -- Nawazuddin Siddiqui from India, the film also features Tahsan. “Thankfully, all my scenes are with Nawazuddin, which is why we got an opportunity to bond closely,” said Tahsan. “Nawazuddin Siddiqui is a very humble person. I believe that because he is grounded, he is still able to soar higher, with regards to his acting career.” The English film is currently under production. There is a saying which basically talks about how the sky should not be the limit and one can go beyond the limits if one worked hard enough and if one wanted to. A musician, actor, father and a teacher, Tahsan Khan, however, simply wants to relax and take one day at a time and do anything and everything that makes him happy. “I am also planning to write a poetry book,” he says. “Composing and writing lines and poetry came to me organically and I am focusing a lot on humane feelings like empathy. I want to the book at the Boi Mela of 2021.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/film/news/prematal-no-lands-man-1847752", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 779}

Khalilur Rahman Babar, mostly known for his roles as an antagonist in Bangla films, breathed his last while under treatment at Square Hospital in the capital yesterday. He was 67. He has been suffering from diabetes, along with ailments of the heart and lungs for a long time. A few days earlier, his health began to deteriorate, after which he was admitted to the hospital, where he later passed away. Babar, a lifetime member of Bangladesh Cholochitro Shilpi Samiti, left behind his wife Sultana Rahman, daughter Umaiyya Rahman and son Riyadur Rahman. Babar began his acting career as a protagonist in Amjad Hossain’s Banglar Mukh. His first villainous role was in the Nayak Raj Razzak starrer, Rangbaaz. Ever since, he gained popularity as an antagonist. Babar acted in around 300 films during his acting career. Apart from acting, he also worked as a producer and director in the industry. Daagi, Daibaan and Dada Bhai are amongst the films directed by Babar. The last film he acted in was Tero Gunda Ek Panda, twelve years ago. As the condition of Babar’s health worsened, he moved away from cinema gradually. At one point, his toes and left leg up to his knee had to be amputated upon the doctor’s suggestion. Babar’s first namaz-e-janaza (funeral prayer) was held yesterday at the Bangladesh Film Development Corporation (BFDC) after Asr prayers. Later he was taken to his Kalabagan residence for the second namaz-e-janaza . He was later put to rest at the Mirpur Buddhijibi Graveyard. Actor Aruna Biswas recalls her role in Babar’s last produced film, Daiban. She starred opposite Ilias Kanchan in the film which was well received by the audience. She reminisced all the good memories she had during those times and prays for Babar. “Babar was a great villain in films, and even a greater human being in reality,” recalls actor Rozina. “He became distant from the industry due to his ill health. Slowly, we are losing all the veteran actors. I pray that may his soul rest in peace.” “Babar was an amazing actor. I have a lot of good memories with him,” says actor Anjana. “It surely is disheartening when I hear the news of someone’s demise, and this day is no different.” Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.", "url": "https://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/film/news/remembering-khalilur-rahman-babar-1790887", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 423}

{"title": "ON-SCREEN LOVE AND HAPPY ENDINGS | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. Through heartbreaks and happy endings, romantic duos in cinema have carried us all on many emotional journeys. There are some screen pairs whose chemistry sizzles more than others, going onto working together in many subsequent films. There are some treasurable instances where on screen romance transcends into real life, yielding in happy marriages and growing families. The first memorable pairing in Bangla cinema occurred before our nation's independence when Sujata and Azim shared the screen space in Roopban . They became an iconic on-screen couple in the '60s and acted in many films together including Obanchito. As their characters fell in love in many narratives, the couple's attraction for each other grew, and they got married. Shabnam and Rahman are another popular couple of the '60s. Shabnam had acted in Urdu films earlier with Nadeem, before landing a role in Rajdhani'r Bukey with Rahman. The couple also went onto act in another hit film titled Darshan . Post independence years saw the rise of Kabori and Razzak. While Razzak appeared alongside many leading ladies, his roles with Kabori became especially popular with the audience. They appeared together in Neel Akasher Niche, Abirbhab, Sritituku Thak, Darpachurno, Rongbaaj, Shorolipi and a few more. After Raj Razzak, Alamgir became the next actor to gain hero status in Bangladesh's budding film industry. The audience found themselves rooting for his pairing with Shabana, and they acted together in a staggering 120 films. Babita found immense popularity in Bangladeshi cinema as a lead actor and worked alongside many male leads throughout her career. However, her pairing with Zafar Iqbal proved to be the most popular. Zafar Iqbal's image as a romantic hero and a singer complemented perfectly with Babita's glamour, resulting in many hit films. Some of their popular works together include Obuj Hridoy, Ek Mutho Bhaat, Shongram, Shurjo Grohon and many more. The pair continued to work together until Zafar Iqbal's tragic death. Actor Farooque also worked with popular stars such as Babita and Kabori during his career. His top films with Kabori include Sarang Bou and Sujon Shathi and his popular works with Babita include Noyonmoni, Lathiyaal and more. Furthermore, Ilias Kanchan is most remembered for his roles with Chompa, particularly their performance together in the films Shohojatri and Bheja Chokh. Chompa worked alongside Manna in many films later in her career. The 1990s observed the emergence of Nayeem and Shabnaz in Chadni. The pair won each other's hearts as well as those of the audience, and later married. But in the same era another hero and heroine took the country by storm, ending in a tragedy the nation would never forget. Salman Shah and Moushumi made their debut in Keyamot Theke Keyamot, and would only act together in four more films before pairing up with other actors. Salman Shah went onto appear in a few more films with Shabnoor before his untimely death, while Moushumi graced the screen with Omar Sani. Moushumi and Omar Sani tied the knot in real life, and continue to work together today. Shabnoor garnered popularity with actor Riaz, appearing in many box office hits. In today's era of films, Shakib Khan has become the 'King of Dhaliwood'. He gained popularity with his appearances alongside Apu Biswas, and they worked in over 70 films together. The duo fell in love on the sets and married, but the match was not meant to be as the couple parted ways recently.

Would you like to comment on that? It is a matter of regret that our cinema theatres are facing these hurdles right now. As a community, we need to keep our differences aside and come together to find solutions that will help the local films to flourish. April 3 marks the National Film Day. As an actor, how important is this day for you? It is delightful to have a day that celebrates the films and film artistes of our nation. I am grateful to the current government for acknowledging the dedication of the people of our industry in this way. Are you working on any films for your own production company? I am hoping to start working on a film for my own company right after I wrap up Password. You will get to hear the details soon. What are your aspirations as you progress through your career as a film star? I believe that my purpose in life is to act in movies and entertain people.

Uttara is amongst the most popular of places when it comes to shooting tele-fictions. The area has a history of providing various apartments which are rented out as shooting houses. These houses remain active more or less throughout the year, but when Eid approaches, its rush hour! Currently, multiple members of the fraternity are working in full swing every day at these locations, to meet their respective deadlines. Even though a fixed working-hour has been set earlier, it is barely implemented when the seasonal bells begin to ring. Anando Bari, one of the most renowned shooting houses in Uttara, served as the venue where many renowned tele-fictions were shot. At one point in time, actor Hridi Haq rented the place for her shoots, namely for the tele-fiction Ananda Bari, from which the house acquired its title. Another popular place for the shoots is Aponghor, which is currently abuzz with the cast and crew members of tele-fictions. Rajjo is yet another shooting house where director Ferdous Hasan works year-round shooting for his projects. However, when he is not working, it is rented out to others for the sake of convenience. The shooting house Nilanjona, also known as Richi’s house, is quite popular for the shooting of TV serials throughout the year. Work is in full progress on a daily basis during the festive season. Asroy and Khonikaloy are amongst the older venues for shooting tele-fictions in Uttara, when shooting houses were not as widespread. The latter derived its name from the title of a TV serial for Maasranga Television, and has been known by that name ever since. Shawpnil 3 is a shooting house that is not only popular for tele-fictions but also films. Apart from the aforementioned spots, there are many more houses across Uttara, which are equally getting busier by the day, as Eid nears.

{"title": "Two telefilms titled #metoo coming this Eid | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. The #metoo movement has been quite a revelation, with women finding courage to expose their harassers through the power of social media. A lot of debate had also sparked regarding well-known people in the society. To some extent, the movement has helped victims of harassment in Bangladesh as well, as well as spread awareness about the actual gravity of the situation. Two telefilms, both titled #metoo, will be released this Eid, attempting to portray the struggles of women who are victims of harassment by the least likely perpetrators. The first, directed by Imraul Rafat, stars Mehazabien Chowdhury as the lead character. The film will star Mehazabien as a young student. “We have a series planned on the subject,” says Rafat. “It will not just revolve around sexual harassment. We will also talk about the injustice and violence that women of all walks face in the society.” This telefilm will be broadcast on Channel i this Eid. The latter #metoo, directed by Sazzad Shuman stars Nusrat Imrose Tisha as the lead character. “My story revolves around a university student, who faces a rather adverse situation,” says Shuman. Very few people believe her complaint, as Tisha’s character fights an uphill battle for justice. Even though both telefilms portray similar subjects, one can expect both to be unique in their own way, as both directors have different styles. To take up such a sensitive subject and tell a story based on it is a gargantuan task in itself, and both Imraul Rafat an Sazzad Shuman deserve credit for their attemps. Any kind of exposure to the movement will go a long way towards raising awareness about sexual harassment and violence. Only time will tell which Eid special will capture the essence of the very sensitive #metoo movement, and do justice to the struggles of the victim fighting for justice in a difficult environment. Ultimately, it will be up to the viewers to decide on the better telefilm.

{"title": "US lawmakers quiz Disney CEO over Xinjiang connection to ‘Mulan’ | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. A group of bipartisan US lawmakers urged Walt Disney Co CEO Bob Chapek to explain the company's connection with \"security and propaganda\" authorities of China's Xinjiang region during the production of live-action war epic \"Mulan\". Disney's $200 million live-action remake of its animated classic about a female warrior in ancient China has run into controversy for being partly filmed in the Xinjiang region, where China's clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims has been criticised by some governments, including the United States, and human rights groups. \"Disney's apparent cooperation with officials of the People's Republic of China (PRC) who are most responsible for committing atrocities - or for covering up those crimes - is profoundly disturbing,\" the Republican senators and representatives wrote in Friday's letter. It urged Disney to make a detailed explanation. The letter was retweeted by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), which monitors human rights and the rule of law and submits an annual report to President Donald Trump and Congress. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lawmakers, including former presidential candidate Marco Rubio, a Republican senator who co-chairs the CECC, said information on Beijing's role in the detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang was all over the media before the filming of \"Mulan.\" \"The decision to film parts of Mulan in cooperation with the local security and propaganda elements, offers tacit legitimacy to those perpetrators of crimes that may warrant the designation of genocide.\" China's foreign ministry has repeatedly denied the existence reeducation camps in the region, calling the facilities vocational and educational institutions and accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy. The lawmakers also asked Disney about the use of local labor, Uighurs or other ethnic minority labor, \"as well as due diligence performed to ensure that no forced labor was used during the film's production.\" The film, out on Disney's streaming service in many markets, was released in China on Friday and earned 46 million yuan ($6.7 million) at the box office by 8:00pm (1200 GMT). The Trump administration said this week it has prepared orders to block imports of cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over the accusations of forced labour.

{"title": "Will bringing in Indian films save our movie theatres? | The Daily Star", "body": "Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action. With every passing day, more and more of our movie theatres have been shutting down due to the lack of quality local content. In October last year, the leaders from the country's three film-related organisations, Bangladesh Film Exhibitors, Producers and Directors Association, agreed to screen Indian Hindi films to keep the cinema hall afloat. In a meeting with the Information Minister last year, the owners of the hall proposed to import and display 10 Indian Hindi films a year. However, no update or initiative have come across in this regard in the last 10 months. \"The government had assured us that we will be allowed to import Hindi films,\" shares Mia Alauddin, senior vice-president of Film Exhibitors' Association. \"Their assurance had boosted our hopes but the matter is still limited to what I see. We are trying to organise another meeting this October to discuss this issue. However, we won't have any choice but to close the halls if we don't see progress in the nearest future.\" Madhumita, one of the largest and oldest cinema halls of Dhaka, has been closed for the past 17 months. \"We are in a very bad shape but no one seems to be concerned about our struggles in this pandemic,\" shares former president of the Hall Owners Association Madhumita Cinema Hall owner Iftekhar Uddin Nawshad. \"We don't have good Bangladeshi films to run in our theatres and thus, can't open the halls for the audience. \"As per our last meeting, we were unanimous about the screening of Hindi movies, however, there has been no further progress in importing Hindi movies since last year,\" mentions noted producer Khorshed Alam Khosru. \"We even promised to prioritise Bangladeshi films over Indian productions during festivals.\" Bringing Hindi content to the Bangladesh audience through theatrical releases seemed to be the only way to save the cinema halls during the pandemic as no local producer is willing to take the risk of releasing their productions in this situation, adds Khorshed Alam Khosru. Shaheen Sumon, General Secretary of President of Bangladesh Film Directors Association (BFDA) looks forward to a unified decision that will help lessen the hurdles faced by all the stake holders in this regard. \"Though we have not come to any conclusive decision regarding this issue, we will soon come up with a definite verdict,\" he concludes.

Three decades after Anthony Hopkins' chilling portrayal of serial killer Hannibal Lecter earned a lead-actor Oscar, the role of a man fighting dementia brought him his second trophy. Despite his pedigree, Hopkins was a surprise winner in the top acting category. The late Chadwick Boseman was widely expected to win the honor, which in a very rare move by the film academy was the last to be handed out this year instead of the usual ceremony-capping best picture. Boseman was nominated for \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom,\" his final film before cancer claimed his life last August at age 43. The \"Black Panther\" star had been diagnosed with the disease four years earlier and kept it private as he continued working. Hopkins' win was also anticlimactic on a show where he wasn't present to accept the trophy. Presenter Joaquin Phoenix's reading of his name was the last dramatic moment of a most unusual ceremony. Hopkins, 83, became the oldest actor or actress to win an Oscar, edging out Christopher Plummer's supporting-actor win at age 82 in the 2010 film \"Beginners.\" Plummer, who died in February at 91, earned an Oscar nod at age 88 for \"All the Money in the World,\" an achievement that stands. Hopkins has received four other Oscar nominations, including last year for his role as Benedict in \"The Two Popes\"; as the eponymous president in \"Nixon\"; John Quincy Adams in the slavery drama \"Amistad,\" and a loyal butler in \"The Remains of the Day.\" In a 2016 interview with The Associated Press, Hopkins said an acting career wasn't in the plan. \"I wanted to be a musician, but I drifted into this business by mistake,\" he said. \"I'm still looking over my shoulder thinking somebody will say, 'Sorry, Tony, you're in the wrong business.'\" Hopkins, who started in the theater but found it ill-fitting, focused on movie roles after getting his screen break playing Richard the Lionheart in \"The Lion in Winter\" in 1968. In 2000, he became a US citizen. He'd been knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993, giving him the right to use ″Sir″ before his name. In Associated Press writer Jake Coyle's review of \"The Father,\" he called it riveting \"to see Hopkins play all these ever-fluctuating turns of mood. ... For an actor so intense, so rigorously unsentimental, this is his Lear.\" Besides Boseman, the other nominees were Riz Ahmed, Gary Oldman and Steven Yeun.

Captain Marvel, the much- anticipated Marvel Cinematic Universe standalone title based on its' premiere female superhero, released on March 8. Brie Larson, the actor who bagged both Academy Award and Golden Globe previously, played the role of Captain Marvel, with supporting characters being Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury, Ben Mendelsohn as Talos, Jude Law as Yon-Rogg and Annette Benning as Dr Wendy Lawson, among others. Brie Larson bore the weight of playing Captain Marvel and being in the centre of a superhero movie gracefully, whether it be performing close combat, or delicately playing emotional scenes. The movie heavily focuses on introducing Carol Danvers to its audience. Initially, Danvers was shown to be suffering from amnesia, and it was a relief to see that the movie did not bombard its audience with countless flashbacks, which would be an unwelcome addition. The character gradually recollected her memory, and came to understand that the Skrulls, a refugee race among the aliens, were the victims of the Kree, their captors. She eventually goes on to embrace her identity as Captain Marvel. One of the more unexpected and enjoyable aspects of the movie was the 'unseen' and humorous sides to the character of Nick Fury. The audience applauded and laughed out loud when the movie disclosed how Fury got his eye injured and marked permanently, which I will not disclose. The film served well as an introduction to Captain Marvel, before her grand entrance in the upcoming movie of MCU, Avengers: Endgame. However, on its own, the plot seemed to lack inspiration: it lacked the quality that would evoke a hefty response, let alone a standing ovation. Perhaps it would be better if Captain Marvel was released after Avengers: Endgame with a better plot and more refined character work. However, for all its mediocrity, it is a good introduction to a very charming female superhero, one that would justify her actions in Avengers: Endgame for the casual audience.

{"title": "New Age | Walking 7,000 steps a day a huge boost to health: research", "body": "People who walk 7,000 steps a day have a dramatically lower risk of a broad range of serious health problems, the largest review of the evidence yet said Thursday. The most widely promoted target for people tracking their number of steps is 10,000 — but that figure reportedly originally came from a 1960s marketing campaign for a Japanese pedometer. To find a more scientific target, an international team of researchers sifted through 57 previous studies that covered 1,60,000 people. The results published in the Lancet Public Health journal found that walking 7,000 steps a day nearly halved people’s risk of early death from all causes, compared to 2,000 steps. The study also looked into health problems not previously covered by research into step counts. Walking 7,000 steps a day was linked to people’s risk of dementia falling by 38 per cent, depression dropping 22 per cent and diabetes decreasing 14 per cent. It was also associated with lower rates of cancer and falls, though the researchers warned this was based on less evidence. ‘You don’t need to hit 10,000 steps a day to get major health benefits,’ Paddy Dempsey, a study co-author and medical researcher at Cambridge University, said. ‘The biggest gains happen before 7,000 steps, and then benefits tend to level off,’ he said. While people’s speeds vary widely, 7,000 steps adds up to roughly an hour of walking throughout the day. Dempsey emphasised that people already managing 10,000 or more steps should keep it up. But he had a message for people who might find 7,000 steps daunting: ‘don’t be discouraged’. ‘If you’re only getting 2,000–3,000 steps a day, aim to add an extra 1,000 steps. That’s just 10–15 minutes of light walking spread across the day,’ he said. Andrew Scott, a researcher at the University of Portsmouth not involved in the study, said that ‘it demonstrates that overall more is always better’. ‘People should not focus too much on the numbers, particularly on days where activity is limited,’ he added. The World Health Organisation recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate to intense physical activity a week. Nearly a third of people worldwide do not reach this target, according to the WHO.

{"title": "New Age | Doctors want women to know nuanced reality of hormone therapy for menopause", "body": "Menopause can usher in a host of disruptive symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and sleep problems. Hormone therapy promises relief. But many women wonder about taking it. That’s because the treatment, subject of a recent expert panel convened by the Food and Drug Administration, has long been shrouded in uncertainty. It was once used routinely. But in 2002, research testing one type was stopped early because of concerns about increased risks of breast cancer and blood clots. Concerns lingered even though later studies showed the benefits of today’s hormone therapies outweigh the risks for many women. ‘There is still a lot of confusion and a lot of fear,’ said Grayson Leverenz, a 50-year-old from Durham, North Carolina, who hesitated to take it but is glad she did. Others increasingly are also giving hormone therapy a second look. But experts continue to disagree about how to present the treatment’s pros and cons. The FDA-assembled panel stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions — prompting dozens of experts to call for more input before making any changes. Doctors say hormone therapy is a great option for many, but not all, menopausal women — and it’s important to understand the nuanced reality of these treatments before deciding what’s best. It treats symptoms that can arise when menstruation winds down and ends, causing levels of estrogen and progesterone to drop very low. One type is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Because it’s applied into the vagina, very little circulates in the blood and the risks are far lower. Doctors say it’s a good option for women whose biggest complaint is vaginal dryness. Whole-body therapy includes pills, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms like hot flashes. Such systemic hormones include estrogens and progestogens. Jennifer Zwink, a nurse in Castle Rock, Colorado, began using an estrogen patch more than a year ago and also has an IUD, which gives her progesterone. The treatment has relieved her hot flashes, improved her sleep and eased her joint pain and bloating. ‘It’s not like a 100 per cent magic wand,’ she said. ‘But it definitely has made a significant difference.’ The Menopause Society says hormone therapy can lower the risk of cardiovascular disease if started within 10 years of reaching menopause. It may also reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes and maintain bone density for longer. ‘They might have a drop in their bone density at age 60’ instead of at age 50, said MargEva Morris Cole, an OB-GYN with Duke University. When Leverenz was first prescribed hormone therapy last year, she kept worrying about the risks she’d heard about — then finally decided: ‘I can’t live like this anymore.’ With a combination of three medications, her anxiety lifted, her sleep improved, her joint pain and hot flashes went away. ‘I just feel like myself again,’ she said. Doctors say many patients hesitate to try hormones, and they try to reassure them. Women can use estrogen therapy for seven years — and estrogen-progestogen therapy for three to five years – before breast cancer risk goes up, according to the Menopause Society. The group says both estrogen therapy and estrogen-progestogen therapy increase the risk of stroke, which goes away soon after stopping hormones. The risk of blood clots rises if you take hormones by mouth, but may be lower if you use a patch, gel or spray. ‘A lot of these risks are small,’ said Nanette Santoro, an OB-GYN at the University of Colorado. ‘And they have to be weighed against the benefit of symptom relief.’ Age, medical history and how long women stay on the hormones are also considerations. Many women take them for around five years, and those who’ve had a stroke or certain other conditions may be advised against using them at all. Doctors are divided over whether there should be changes in ‘black box’ health warnings on some hormone treatments. All estrogen drugs still carry boxed warnings about the higher rates of stroke, blood clots and cognitive problems among women taking the medications. Most of the physicians at the recent expert panel meeting convened by the FDA prescribe the hormones or are involved with a pharmaceutical industry campaign opposing the warning label. A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that ‘removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk,’ and asked the agency to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes. In the meantime, doctors urge people to be wary of misinformation, like false claims on social media posts that hormones will prevent dementia and ensure a healthy old age. ‘We can’t say that you are going to live a longer, healthier life because you took hormones,’ Duke’s Cole said. ‘I don’t want the pendulum to go so far that people feel that it is promising health for the next 30 to 40 years.’ Santoro pointed to a new non-hormonal medication called fezolinetant, marketed as Veozah, for hot flashes and night sweats. The anti-epileptic medication gabapentin, in low doses, can also be used for hot flashes and a moisturizer can improve vaginal dryness. Experts also say regular exercise and a healthy diet can help manage symptoms. Santoro urged against the ‘wild proliferation’ of supplements claiming to be menopause cure-alls. ‘Everybody is in on the menopause gold rush,’ she said. ‘If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/adults-health/273986/doctors-want-women-to-know-nuanced-reality-of-hormone-therapy-for-menopause", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 951}
{"title": "New Age | Dengue: September turns deadliest month", "body": "Single-day highest 6 deaths reported in 24 hours At least 45 people died of dengue in the 18 days of September, already making it the deadliest month in terms of fatalities this year, with 12 days still remaining. The death figure surpassed this year’s previous highest of 41 fatalities in July. The country also saw the highest single-day toll on Thursday, as six people died in the 24 hours till 8:00am, the Directorate General of Health Services said. At least 647 patients were hospitalised in the same period. This has pushed the death toll from the Aedes mosquito-borne virus to 167 since January, with 40,461 hospitalisations. Officials admitted that the real figures were higher as data came only from selected facilities. According to the DGHS, the latest deaths included five women and one man, aged between 16 and 63. Two of the new deaths were reported in Dhaka North City Corporation area hospitals, two in Dhaka South City Corporation, one in Barishal division and another in Chattogram division area hospitals. Bangladesh also witnessed deaths from dengue in other months. At least 10 people died in January, three in February, seven in April, three in May, 19 in June, 41 in July, and 39 in August. No deaths were reported in March. Monthly data show 1,161 hospitalisations in January, 374 in February, 336 in March, 701 in April, 1,773 in May, 5,951 in June, 10,684 in July and 10,496 in August. As of now, 2,042 dengue patients are receiving treatment across hospitals in Bangladesh. Of these, 717 are in hospitals in Dhaka, while 1,325 are in hospitals outside the capital. The Directorate General of Health Services on Tuesday issued a 12-point directive asking hospitals to prioritise dengue treatment as hospitalisations and deaths continue to rise across the country. The DGHS asked hospitals to form specialist-led medical boards to supervise dengue and chikungunya treatment. ICU support must be prioritised for critical patients, while suspected cases should receive urgent NS1 tests and round-the-clock diagnostic and treatment services. It also instructed hospitals to allocate designated wards or areas for admitted patients and assign dedicated doctors and residents under the medical board for exclusive care. An epidemiologist and former director of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research AM Zakir Hussain said that the Aedes were getting a suitable rain and temperature for more breeding now. ‘Dengue usually peaks in July, but this year rain has continued into September. We fear cases will not come under control immediately. Numbers may only begin to fall slowly from October,’ he warned. The Dhaka South City Corporation’s acting chief health officer, Dr Nishat Parveen, said that dengue cases in the capital were still climbing despite intensified control efforts. She said that the city corporation was doing its best with available facilities. She emphasised the need for proper treatment and public awareness to reduce mosquito bites. Bangladesh has faced recurring dengue outbreaks since its first official one in 2000, when 93 people died and 5,551 were hospitalised. The situation has worsened in recent years: dengue claimed 1,705 lives and led to 3,21,179 hospitalisations in 2023 alone, compared with 853 deaths and 244,246 hospitalisations in the entire period between 2000 and 2022. Past year, the country suffered another severe wave, with 575 deaths and 1,01,214 reported cases. Public health experts now fear Bangladesh is entering another prolonged season of high dengue transmission, driven by climate variability, urban crowding, and weak mosquito-control measures.

{"title": "New Age | Malnutrition causes unrecognised type of diabetes: experts", "body": "Malnutrition can cause its own form of diabetes, health experts said Thursday, calling for ‘type 5 diabetes’ to be recognised globally to help fight the disease in countries already struggling with poverty and starvation. The most common form of diabetes, type 2, can be caused by obesity and occurs when adults become resistant to the hormone insulin. Type 1, mostly diagnosed in childhood, arises when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. But diabetes researchers have been tracking another form of the disease, which often appears in people aged under 30. It also affects insulin production but is less severe than type 1. And rather than being linked to being overweight or obese like type 2, it affects people who are underweight because they do not eat enough. A paper published in medical journal The Lancet Global Health shows that more than 25 million people suffer from this ‘type 5 diabetes’, mostly in developing countries. ‘We call upon the international diabetes community to recognise this distinct form of the disease,’ the authors wrote, reflecting a consensus reached by the International Diabetes Federation earlier this year. The experts settled on calling this form of diabetes type 5, though types 3 and 4 have not been officially recognised. Diabetes driven by malnutrition is not a new discovery — in the 1980s and 1990s, the World Health Organisation classified a form of ‘malnutrition-related diabetes’. But the UN agency abandoned this classification in 1999 due to a lack of agreement among experts about whether undernourishment alone was enough to cause diabetes. Since then, numerous studies in countries including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Uganda, Pakistan and Rwanda have indicated that this is possible. The exact link between malnutrition and this strand of diabetes remains unknown. The efficacy of existing diabetes treatments that do not focus on weight loss on type 5 is also unclear. The best way to fight the disease involves supporting programmes already working to combat poverty and hunger, the authors of the paper said. This includes giving people access to ‘low-cost, energy-dense staple foods high in protein and complex carbohydrates’ such as lentils, legumes, oil-enriched cereals and fortified grains, they added.

{"title": "New Age | Study finds women have higher genetic risk of depression", "body": "Women are genetically at higher risk of clinical depression than men, Australian researchers found in a study published Wednesday that could change how the disorder is treated. Billed as one of the largest-ever studies of its kind, scientists poured through the DNA of almost 2,00,000 people with depression to pinpoint shared genetic ‘flags’. Women had almost twice as many of these genetic markers linked to depression than men, according to the project led by Australia’s Berghofer Medical Research Institute. ‘The genetic component to depression is larger in females compared to males,’ said researcher Jodi Thomas. ‘Unpacking the shared and unique genetic factors in males and females gives us a clearer picture of what causes depression — and opens the door to more personalised treatments.’ It has long been known that depression is more common in women, but the biological causes remain something of a mystery. Around 13,000 genetic markers were linked with depression in women, the researchers found, compared with 7,000 markers in men. Some of these genetic changes could alter biological pathways linked to metabolism or hormone production. ‘We found some genetic differences that may help explain why females with depression more often experience metabolic symptoms, such as weight changes or altered energy levels,’ Thomas said. Researcher Brittany Mitchell said the findings could lead to changes in how depression is treated in women. ‘Until now, there hasn’t been much consistent research to explain why depression affects females and males differently, including the possible role of genetics,’ she said. ‘There are more and more stories coming out about how many of the medications that are currently developed — and the research that we’ve known to date — has mostly been focused around men or male participants.’ Clinical depression, or major depressive disorder, is one of the most common mental disorders in the world. More than 300 million people across the globe have depression, according to the World Health Organisation. The study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications.

{"title": "New Age | Experts stress cancer screening to reduce deaths", "body": "Experts and public health campaigners at a discussion on Friday urged the government to introduce nationwide cancer screening programmes to reduce preventable deaths, particularly from breast cancer. The Bangladesh Breast Cancer Awareness Forum organised the discussion at the National Press Club in the capital and held a rally to observe the 13th Breast Cancer Awareness Day, said a press release. Since 2013, October 10 has been observed as Breast Cancer Awareness Day in Bangladesh, aiming at raising public awareness about early detection and timely treatment of the disease. The campaign focuses on educating women about prevention, encouraging early diagnosis and promoting timely treatment to save lives. The forum’s founder and chief coordinator, Professor Dr Habibullah Talukder Raskin, moderated the discussion, addressed by public health experts and activists. Among the speakers were Dr Zakir Hossain, member of the Health Reform Commission and chairperson of the Community Clinic Trust; Professor Dr Mozaherul Huq, former regional adviser of the World Health Organisation; Professor Dr Syed Akram Hossain, chair of the Oncology Department at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University; and Dr Halida Hanum Akhter, member of the Women’s Rights Reform Commission and faculty at Johns Hopkins University. Professor Raskin explained this year’s theme of the day—‘Know and Act: Screening Saves Lives’, he said that although awareness activities had continued for over two decades, many women still hesitated to seek screening or preventive services. ‘It’s time not just to know, but to act and come under screening coverage,’ he said. Citing international estimates, Dr Raskin noted that around 13,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the country each year, and about 6,000 die from the disease. The Gonoshasthaya Community-Based Cancer Hospital in Dhanmondi has also introduced a special initiative to provide breast cancer surgery and chemotherapy at minimal cost, including surgery for extremely poor patients for as little as Tk 5,000.

{"title": "New Age | WHO issues unprecedented global guidelines to combat infertility", "body": "The World Health Organisation on Friday published for the first time directives to improve the prevention, detection and treatment of infertility, which affects millions across the globe. ‘One in six people worldwide experience infertility during their lifetime,’ said Pascale Allotey, the global health body’s head of sexual and reproductive health. ‘The condition affects individuals and couples across all regions and income levels. ‘And yet access to safe and affordable care remains highly inequitable.’ Allotey told reporters that the issue of infertility had been neglected ‘for far too long’. The new guide would provide a ‘unified, evidence-based foundation’ to ensure care is safe, effective and accessible for all, she added. According to the WHO, infertility is a condition of the male and female reproductive system, defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual relations. The situation can lead to major distress, stigmatisation and financial difficulties. In several countries, most of the cost of infertility tests and treatment is borne by patients, which often leads to ‘catastrophic financial expenditures’. ‘In some settings, even a single round of in vitro fertilisation can cost double the average annual housheold income,’ the WHO said. The guide, published on Friday, sets out 40 recommendations and calls for the integration of fertility in national health funding, services and strategies. It also wants to see steps for effective clinical management, in both diagnosis and treatment. For example, the WHO calls for male diagnoses, which are often under-investigated, suggesting a range of approaches, starting with advice before moving to active treatment. It also advises increased investment in prevention. Health professionals need to address the main risk factors for infertility, which include untreated sexually transmitted infections and smoking, it says.

{"title": "New Age | Reproductive literacy delays adolescent pregnancy: study", "body": "The critical importance of applied reproductive health literacy and family planning services in deferring adolescent pregnancy has been underscored by a study conducted in the Gaibandha district. The research findings reveal that pregnancy rates among adolescent girls who received regular reproductive health education, counseling, and family planning support were significantly lower than those of the control group. These results were disseminated on Thursday at a workshop organised at The Daily Star Centre in the capital to present the midline survey findings of the study titled ‘Delaying Adolescent Pregnancy: The Role of Practical Reproductive Health Knowledge’. According to the study, the incidence of ever-pregnant adolescents within the intervention group stands at 8.5 per cent, whereas it reaches 18 per cent in the control group. Similarly, the prevalence of current pregnancies among adolescents in the intervention group is 6 per cent, in contrast to 16 per cent in the control group. Researchers assert that this disparity is statistically significant, underscoring the direct role of reproductive health literacy in deferring adolescent pregnancy. Furthermore, the midline survey reveals that adolescents who received reproductive health education exhibit a markedly higher inclination toward delaying pregnancy. Specifically, 88 per cent of adolescents in the intervention group expressed a desire to postpone pregnancy, compared to 67 per cent in the control group. Moreover, approximately 97 per cent of the intervention group possess an accurate understanding of the minimum legal age of marriage for girls — a finding that suggests a positive shift toward the prevention of child marriage. The project’s impact also extends to the educational sphere, with survey results indicating that 86.6 per cent of the total adolescent cohort remains enrolled in education. According to the researchers, awareness of reproductive health bolsters the self-confidence and decision-making capacity of adolescent girls, thereby playing a pivotal role in ensuring school retention. In collaboration with the Institute of Developing Economies (IDE-JETRO), Japan, and Florida International University, USA, the MOMODa FOUNDATION conducted the study involving 1,200 adolescent girls across 120 villages in the Gaibandha Sadar and Saghata upazilas. As part of the intervention framework, 60 adolescent clubs were established for girls aged 13 to 17, providing year-long regular monthly sessions, individual counseling, emergency helpline services, and the distribution of complimentary family planning kits to married adolescents. The project was implemented in three distinct phases: a baseline survey from December 2023 to January 2024, an intervention period from February 2024 to January 2025, and a midline survey from February to March 2025, during which data from 1,185 adolescents were aggregated. The intervention activities were facilitated by the Reproductive Health Services Training and Education Programme. At the workshop, Professor Momoe Makino, Senior Research Fellow at IDE, provided a synthesis of the research. At the same time, Abu S Shonchoy, associate professor at Florida International University, presented the core findings. Shonchoy remarked that equipping adolescents with timely and practical reproductive health information empowers them to make informed decisions regarding their physiology, education, and prospects, which serves as a potent catalyst in reducing adolescent pregnancy. In her concluding remarks, Ashrafi Ahmad, director general of the Directorate General of Family Planning, asserted that the findings of this study will serve as vital empirical evidence for policymakers to fortify adolescent reproductive health initiatives at the national level and facilitate the strategic optimization of national programs. The event was attended by officials from various government departments, representatives from diverse national and international development organisations, and academics specializing in public health research from various universities across the country.

Rwandan-backed M23 fighters have made big gains in the eastern DR Congo, seizing the cities of Goma and Bukavu and stoking fears of a regional conflagration. The UN refugee agency UNHCR had expected that the violence would send people fleeing into Burundi, making plans to help up to 58,000 people over three months, said Brigitte Mukanga-Eno, agency’s representative in Burundi. But ‘just in first two weeks, we have received ... around 42,000 people already seeking asylum’, she said as she addressed reporters in Geneva via a video link from Bujumbura. She said that more than 36,000 people had crossed the Rusizi river, near Rugombo, while another 6,000 had crossed directly to a transit centre close to the largest city Bujumbura. ‘Last week on Tuesday, we had more than 9,000 people who crossed in one day,’ she said. ‘Everyone is overwhelmed: the government, but also the humanitarian actors in the country who are trying our best.’ The agency said it was seeking $40.4 million to strengthen preparedness and deliver life-saving protection and assistance to 275,000 internally displaced people in the DRC’s South Kivu, North Kivu, Maniema and Tanganyika provinces.

{"title": "New Age | 7,000 killed in eastern DRC since January: PM", "body": "Violence raging in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has killed ‘more than 7,000 compatriots’, many of them civilians, since last month, the Congolese premier said Monday. The Rwanda-backed M23 armed group has seized large swathes of the mineral-rich eastern DRC — including the main cities of Goma and Bukavu — in the face of limited resistance from Congolese forces. ‘The security situation in eastern DRC has reached alarming levels,’ prime minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka told the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, stressing that since January, ‘the deaths of more than 7,000 compatriots’ had been registered. They include ‘more than 2,500 bodies buried without being identified’, she said, adding that another 1,500 bodies were still in the morgue. Asked at a press briefing on the sidelines of the council whether the dead were civilians or soldiers, she said that ‘for the moment we have not yet been able to identify all of these people’. But, she stressed, ‘there is a significant mass of civilians who are part of these dead’. The M23 movement, supported by some 4,000 Rwandan soldiers, according to UN experts, now controls large tracts of eastern DRC, a troubled region rich in natural resources. Its rapid advance has sent thousands fleeing. Fighters took control of the South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu just over a week ago, after first capturing Goma, the capital of North Kivu and the main city in the country’s east, last month. The premier said that more than 3,000 people had been killed in Goma alone.

{"title": "New Age | Somali govt claims 70 Al-Shabaab killed", "body": "More than 70 members of the Islamist armed group Al-Shabaab were killed during an army operation with local forces in Somalia, the information ministry said on Tuesday. Al-Qaeda-linked Al-Shabaab has been fighting the federal government for more than 15 years, to try to establish Islamic law in the impoverished country. ‘Over 70 extremist militants were eliminated through the coordinated efforts of the National Army and local forces,’ the ministry said in a statement. ‘In addition to the significant militant losses, a large cache of weapons was seized, and several combat vehicles utilised by the extremists were destroyed.’ The operation took place on Tuesday at several sites in Hirshabelle state, in south central Somalia, it added. AFP could not independently verify the death toll but several witnesses confirmed the fighting. ‘The armed men of Al-Shabaab were beaten,’ one resident contacted by telephone said, adding that ‘dozens’ of their bodies were visible in the combat zones. Several sources said the armed operation came in response to Al-Shabaab attacks in the area in the last few days. Al-Shabaab has carried out numerous bomb and other attacks in the capital Mogadishu and several other regions of the volatile Horn of Africa country. Although they were driven out of the capital by African Union forces in 2011, the group is still present in rural areas. Somalia’s president has promised ‘total’ war against Al-Shabaab. The army has joined forces with local militias in a military campaign backed by an AU force and US airstrikes.

{"title": "New Age | 46 killed in Sudan plane crash", "body": "Forty-six people were killed when a Sudanese military transport plane crashed into a residential neighbourhood on the outskirts of Khartoum, the regional government said on Wednesday. The Antonov aircraft went down on Tuesday night near Wadi Seidna air base, one of the army’s largest military hubs in Omdurman, northwest of the capital. The army, which has been at war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces since April 2023, said the plane crashed during takeoff, killing and injuring both military personnel and civilians. ‘After a final tally, the number of martyrs reached 46, with 10 injured,’ the Khartoum regional government’s media office said in a statement. The army-aligned health ministry had previously reported at least 19 dead. Witnesses described hearing a loud explosion and seeing several homes damaged in the area. The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods. The ministry said emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital. A military source cited a technical malfunction as the cause of the crash. The crash came a day after the RSF claimed responsibility for shooting down a Russian-made Ilyushin aircraft over Nyala, the capital of South Darfur The paramilitary group said the plane was destroyed with its crew on-board. The recent escalation follows significant advances by the army in central Sudan and the capital Khartoum in its multi-front offensive against the RSF. Late on Saturday, RSF signed a charter with allied political and armed groups in Nairobi, Kenya, paving the way for the formation of a parallel government in rebel-held areas. Since April 2023, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy and RSF commander Mohamed Hamadan Daglo, once allies, have been locked in a deadly power struggle. The war, which has claimed tens of thousands of lives, erupted after a rift emerged between Burhan and Daglo over the future structure of the government. The conflict has triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters in recent memory, according to the United Nations. The fighting has devastated Khartoum and other major cities, displacing over 12 million, plunging the country into hunger and crippling critical infrastructure.

The attacks by the Allied Democratic Forces were carried out Tuesday and Wednesday in Ituri province along the border with Uganda. ‘A total of 23 people executed by these rebels’ in the villages of Matolo and Samboko, Jospin Paluku, coordinator of one of the main civil society organizations in Mambasa territory, told AFP, specifying that the toll is provisional. At least another 20 civilians were ‘taken hostage, including the son of the village chief of Matolo’, he added. Humanitarian groups confirmed the numbers and said they were likely to rise. The victims were mostly farmers working in the fields, a local police chief said. ADF, which is made of former Ugandan rebels, has been implanted since the mid-1990s in the north-east of the DRC, where it has killed thousands of civilians despite the deployment of the Ugandan army alongside the Congolese armed forces. At the end of 2021, Kampala and Kinshasa launched a joint military operation against the ADF, called ‘Shujaa’, without so far managing to put an end to their operations. Paluku said it was the first ADF attack since the start of the year, after a three-month lull.

{"title": "New Age | UN says children as young as one raped in Sudan", "body": "Children as young as one have been raped by armed men during the conflict in Sudan, the UN said on Tuesday, condemning it as a horror that should ‘shock anyone to their core’. UNICEF said the scale of child rape in war-ravaged Sudan was far more widespread than just the documented cases and urged all sides to end sexual violence as a war tactic. Gender-based violence service providers in Sudan recorded some 221 cases of child rape since the beginning of 2024. Of those cases, 66 per cent of the survivors were girls and 33 per cent were boys. There were 16 survivors under the age of five — including four who were as young as one. The UN children’s agency recorded an additional 77 reported cases of sexual assault against children — primarily attempted rape. ‘Painstakingly verified by the United Nations, these figures provide only a partial picture of the true magnitude of violence inflicted against children,’ UNICEF said. It said survivors and their families were often unwilling or unable to come forward, fearing stigma, rejection from their family or community, retribution from armed groups, confidentiality breaches, or being accused of being a collaborator. ‘Children as young as one being raped by armed men should shock anyone to their core and compel immediate action,’ said UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell. ‘Millions of children in Sudan are at risk of rape and other forms of sexual violence, which is being used as a tactic of war. This is an abhorrent violation of international law and could constitute a war crime. It must stop.’ Sudan’s regular army (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been locked in a battle for power since April 2023. The fighting has plunged Sudan into what the UN calls the world’s largest humanitarian catastrophe. In its report entitled ‘Sudan’s child rape and sexual violence crisis’, UNICEF said attacks included armed men storming homes and demanding families surrender their girls; and raping girls in front of their loved ones. The report did not single out either the SAF or the RSF as being behind particular crimes. Victims were left with serious physical injury, including wounds, fractures, abscesses, and other complications. ‘No person, no child, should have to endure these horrors,’ the report said. It said sexual violence could have life-long consequences and leave survivors facing ‘impossible choices’ such as handling a resultant pregnancy, and whether to speak out or seek health support. UNICEF released clips from interviews with victims, maintaining their anonymity. ‘They forced me into a big car... They took me to a place next to a railway, and three people raped me,’ said one 16-year-old girl. ‘They were beating me and raping me and threw me next to the railway, and a woman came and helped me go home... and when I arrived, I was in a terrible condition.’ The girl is now nine months pregnant. An adult woman was held by armed men for 19 days in a room with other women and girls. ‘After nine at night, someone opens the door, carrying a whip, selects one of the girls, and takes her to another room. I could hear the little girl crying and screaming. They were raping her,’ she said. ‘Every time they raped her, this girl would come back covered in blood... They only release these girls at dawn, and they return almost unconscious.’ UNICEF urged the Sudanese government and all parties to the conflict to respect their obligations to protect civilians, especially children, while those providing services to survivors must be protected. ‘In decision-making on funding, GBV programmes must be treated by donors as lifesaving,’ the agency said.

{"title": "New Age | THREAT TO PEACE DEAL: South Sudan general, oil minister arrested", "body": "South Sudan troops have arrested the oil minister and deputy head of the armed forces, both allies of vice-president Riek Machar, as fears grew on Wednesday for the country’s fragile peace agreement. General Gabriel Duop Lam, a close ally of Machar, was arrested on Tuesday after being accused by the army of supporting rebels in Upper Nile state in the northeast of the country. Machar’s spokesman confirmed the arrest in a statement and said the vice-president’s home in the capital Juba had been surrounded by troops of the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces, the regular army allied to president Salva Kiir. The rivalry between Kiir and Machar helped trigger a civil war between 2013 and 2018 that left some 4,00,000 dead. It was ended with a power-sharing agreement between them, but many steps in the deal — including the holding of elections — have been repeatedly delayed. Machar’s spokesperson Pal Mai Deng said in a statement that the general’s arrest on Tuesday ‘violates’ the peace deal. ‘This act puts the entire agreement at risk,’ he said. ‘We are also gravely concerned about the heavy deployment of SSPDF around (Machar’s) residence,’ he added. The moves were followed overnight with the arrest of petroleum minister Puot Kang Chol, another ally of Machar. ‘Puot Kang Chol, several family members, and his bodyguards were arrested at his residence in Juba. The operation was conducted by personnel identified as members of the National Security Service,’ his press secretary wrote in a statement on Facebook. The tensions appear to have been sparked by growing concern over unrest in Upper Nile state. The SSPDF has accused Duop Lam and his troops of working with the so-called White Army rebels in the region, who are predominantly from the same ethnic Nuer community. The UN Mission in South Sudan last month reported increased fighting between the army and ‘armed youth’ in Nassir county in Upper Nile, involving ‘heavy weaponry which has, reportedly, resulted in deaths and injuries to civilians as well as armed personnel’. The civil war began just two years after South Sudan became independent from Sudan. The country remains mired in poverty and violence.

They warned such a move would ‘risk exacerbating the on-going conflict in Sudan, fragmenting the country, and worsening an already dire humanitarian situation’. They also urged warring factions to immediately cease hostilities and engage in ‘political dialogue and diplomatic efforts towards a durable ceasefire’. For nearly two years, the army and RSF have been locked in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee calls the ‘biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded’. The war has torn the country in two, with the army controlling the north and east, while the RSF holds nearly all of the western region of Darfur and swathes of the south.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan files case against UAE at top UN court over ‘complicity in genocide’", "body": "Sudan has filed a case against the United Arab Emirates arguing that the Gulf state is complicit in genocide over its alleged support for Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the International Court of Justice announced on Thursday. Khartoum contends the UAE is ‘complicit in the genocide on the Masalit (community in Sudan) through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia,’ the ICJ said in a statement. ‘The United Arab Emirates fuels the rebellion and supports the militia that has committed the crime of genocide in West Darfur,’ the Sudan submission to the court said. The UAE, which has repeatedly denied supporting the RSF, dismissed the case as a ‘publicity stunt’ and said it would try to have it thrown out. The case ‘is nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt aimed at diverting attention,’ a UAE official said in a statement sent to AFP, adding: ‘The UAE will seek the immediate dismissal of this baseless application.’ For nearly two years, the RSF and the regular army in Sudan have fought a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 12 million. Famine has been declared in parts of the country and is likely to spread. Sudan called on the ICJ, which rules in disputes between countries, to issue emergency orders — ’provisional measures’ in the court jargon — to force the UAE to pay reparations, among other requests. ‘The United Arab Emirates must make full reparation for the injury caused (by) its internationally wrongful acts, including paying reimbursement to the victims of the war,’ Sudan’s submission argued. ICJ rulings are legally binding but the court has no power to enforce them. For example, it ordered Russia to halt its assault on Ukraine only a few weeks after the invasion — to no avail. But Khartoum urged the court to act quickly ‘to ensure the urgent and fullest possible protection for the Sudanese civilian people who remain at grave and immediate risk of continuing and further acts of genocide.’ Sudan’s submission accused the RSF of ‘genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violations of human rights.’ It added that these acts were ‘perpetrated and enabled by the direct support given to the rebel RSF militia and related militia groups by the United Arab Emirates.’ Sudan charged that the UAE was breaching its obligations under the 1948 UN Genocide Convention ‘by attempting to commit genocide, conspiring to commit genocide, inciting genocide, complicity in genocide, and failing to prevent and punish genocide.’ ‘The allegations presented by the SAF representative at the ICJ lack any legal or factual basis, representing yet another attempt to distract from this calamitous war,’ the UAE official said. In June, Sudan’s UN ambassador Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith accused the UAE of fomenting conflict in his country, saying the RSF was being ‘supported with weapons by the Emirates’. The Emirati envoy to the United Nations, Mohamed Issa Hamad Mohamed Abushahab, rejected the claims as ‘ludicrous’ and accused Sudan of using the council to plead the army’s case. UN experts monitoring an arms embargo on Darfur said accusations that the UAE had funnelled weapons to the RSF through Chad were ‘credible’. The Gulf state promised the United States in December that it would not arm the RSF, after two US lawmakers attempted to block its purchase of $1.2 billion in advanced rockets and long-range missiles.

{"title": "New Age | Pro-govt DR Congo fighters kill 35 civilians", "body": "At least 35 people were killed when pro-government militia attacked a village in the restive eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local and security sources said on Friday. The attack happened at about 3:00am Thursday in the village of Tambi, in the Masisi area of North Kivu province controlled by the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group. A security source told AFP that at least 35 people were killed in the attack, while local sources and an eyewitness put the death toll at more than 40. A community leader and a medical source said villagers had recently returned to the area after having fled fighting between the Rwanda-backed M23 and the Congolese army and local militia. ‘The ‘wazalendo’ [patriots in Swahili] militia went to attack Tambi where residents had started to return... they opened fire and civilians were killed,’ said one community leader, who said 43 people died. ‘They put some victims in a church and then shot them. Those who were in the fields were killed there.’ The community leader, a local health worker and a local resident said another group of civilians sought refuge in a house and died when the militia set it on fire. ‘We counted 47 bodies in the morning,’ the resident said, adding that they were buried in a communal grave. Some of the victims were unable to be identified because of their burns, he added. Different groups make up the militia, which has fought alongside the Congolese army against the M23. Their fighters are often accused of attacking civilians. The M23, which according to UN experts is backed by some 4,000 Rwandan soldiers, is also accused of abuses. The armed group resumed its fight against the government in Kinshasa in 2021 and has since seized swathes of territory in North Kivu, which borders Rwanda. A lightning offensive in recent weeks has seen it capture the provincial capital, Goma, and Bukavu, the main city in the neighbouring province of South Kivu. The DRC’s mineral-rich east has been ravaged for three decades by conflict and atrocities.

{"title": "New Age | AU warns of huge risk of partition in Sudan", "body": "The African Union on Wednesday said the announcement of a parallel government in war-torn Sudan risked cleaving the country, already ravaged by nearly two years of unrest. The conflict between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and the regular Sudanese army has left tens of thousands dead and displaced more than 12 million people, in what the UN has described as an ‘unprecedented humanitarian crisis on the African continent’. The war, which was initially sparked by disagreements over the integration of the RSF into the army, has torn the country apart, with the army now controlling eastern and northern Sudan and the RSF dominating almost all of western Darfur and parts of the south. The RSF and its allies last month signed in Nairobi a ‘founding charter’ of a parallel government. On Wednesday the AU said in a statement that it condemned the move and ‘warned that such action carries a huge risk of partitioning of the country.’ The signatories to the document, seen by AFP, intend to create a ‘government of peace and unity’ in rebel-controlled areas. They have also pledged to ‘build a secular, democratic, decentralised state, based on freedom, equality and justice, without cultural, ethnic, religious or regional bias.’ In early March, the RSF and its allies signed, again in Nairobi, a ‘Transitional Constitution’. The AU called on all of its member states as well as the international community ‘not to recognise any government or parallel entity aimed at partitioning and governing part of the territory of the Republic of Sudan or its institutions’. The AU added it ‘does not recognise the so-called government or parallel entity in the Republic of Sudan’. On Tuesday, the European Union said in a statement that the parallel government threatens Sudanese democratic aspirations, echoing a statement by the UN Security Council last week.

{"title": "New Age | Dozens kidnapped in Mali", "body": "Suspected jihadists abducted dozens of civilians after holding up a bus in the centre of jihadist-rocked Mali, an eyewitness and local sources said Thursday. Tuesday’s attack saw a bus bound for the capital Bamako from the central town of Bankass ‘intercepted by a group of jihadists’, said local Bankass leader Abdalah Togo in a statement. A man passing by on the road told AFP he saw ‘five motorcycles and six people’ by the bus at the time of the hold-up. ‘Other attackers were already on the bus checking the passengers,’ the eyewitness added. ‘They were carrying weapons and wearing turbans.’ The attack resulted in ‘several dozen people abducted by suspected jihadists’, a security source told AFP on Thursday. ‘The kidnapped people are civilians,’ the source added. ‘The women and children were freed while the men were brought to an unknown destination.’ A local official said on Thursday that ‘buses coming from Bankass are often targeted by armed groups’, several kidnappings having taken place over the last three years. Those kidnapped ‘were never released’, the official added. But ‘no one expected this latest kidnapping because traffic has been normal for around three months’, said the official. Another Bankass source suggested the abductions were reprisals. ‘They warned us not to mix with villages that have not signed a deal with them,’ the source said. Since 2012, Mali has been in the throes of a profound security crisis fuelled in large part by armed jihadists affiliated to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, as well as criminal gangs. Following coups in 2020 and then 2021 the Sahel country has been led by a military junta, who have pledged to restore order and crack down on violent Islamists. But jihadist attacks continue to trouble the nation, despite the junta’s claims that its stepped-up military campaigns and tilt towards security cooperation with Russia have turned the tide.

Sharing images of some of those rescued, including women and children, after their boats capsized, the force said they were all migrants from sub-Saharan African countries attempting to cross the sea to Europe. The survivors were rescued in several operations in the Sfax region to the east of the centre of the country after their boats capsized or broke down, according to the national guard. Exhausted people including women and children, some of whom appear to be dead, can be seen in the images. Some are pictured clinging on to large buoys. In another image, a woman struggles to hoist a child, his body rigid and apparently lifeless, aboard the rescue boat. Maritime guard members ‘succeeded in thwarting several separate attempts to reach Europe clandestinely’, the national guard said in a press release. Along with Libya, Tunisia has in recent years become a key departure point in north Africa for migrants making the perilous Mediterranean Sea crossing in hopes of reaching a better life in Europe. Its coastline in some places lies fewer than 150 kilometres from the Italian island of Lampedusa, often their first port of call. Each year, tens of thousands of people attempt to make the crossing.

{"title": "New Age | RSF attacks kill 50 in Khartoum in one week", "body": "Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces killed at least 50 people in Khartoum during the past week, rescuers said Wednesday, as fighting with the army for control of the capital intensifies. ‘Khartoum is experiencing tragic conditions, with citizens in multiple areas facing widespread violations by the RSF and allied militias,’ the Khartoum Emergency Response Room, part of a network of volunteers coordinating aid across Sudan, said in a statement. The group said about 70 people, including 12 volunteers, had been abducted during the past week, and that forced displaced had sharply increased in the capital’s centre, south and east. Cases of sexual violence had also been reported, though the exact numbers remained unclear due to fear and social stigma, the group said. Malnutrition, it added, had reached ‘dangerous’ levels, leaving seven children dead since the start of March. The United Nations children’s agency, UNICEF, says about 3.2 million children are expected to face malnutrition in Sudan this year. Famine has been declared in three displacement camps in the western region of Darfur as well as parts of the Nuba mountains in the south, according to a UN-backed assessment. The war between the RSF and the army, which began in April 2023, has escalated in recent months, with the army seeking to reclaim territory in Khartoum and beyond. In a video address shared Saturday on Telegram, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo appeared wearing a kadamol headscarf, often associated with RSF fighters, and declaring his troops ‘will not leave the Republican Palace’. The army said on Monday that its forces advancing on Khartoum from the south had converged with troops in the capital’s centre, increasing pressure on rival paramilitary fighters and inching closer to retaking the city. Nationwide, the conflict has killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million, and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. In Khartoum alone, at least 3.5 million people have been forced from their homes due to the violence while at least 1,00,000 people are facing acute famine conditions, according to the United Nations.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan army retakes presidential palace from RSF", "body": "Sudan’s army said it recaptured the presidential palace in the capital Khartoum from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces on Friday after a fierce battle. ‘Our forces completely destroyed the enemy’s fighters and equipment, and seized large quantities of equipment and weapons,’ army spokesman Nabil Abdallah said in a statement broadcast on state television. Abdallah vowed the army would ‘continue to progress on all fronts until victory is complete and every inch of our country is purged of the militia and its supporters’. On social media, soldiers shared videos appearing to be inside the presidential palace, exchanging congratulations. AFP could not immediately verify the footage. Paramilitary fighters overran the palace in April 2023, when war broke out between the RSF and the army. At the time, the RSF swiftly took control of Khartoum’s streets, with the army-aligned government fleeing to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. Central Khartoum, where the presidential palace stands alongside ministries and the capital’s business district, has seen fierce fighting in recent months, after army troops surged through the city. Earlier this week, the army said its forces had merged from the north and south, hemming in the RSF. ‘With the army entering the Republican Palace, which means control of central Khartoum, the militia has lost its elite forces,’ a military expert said. The paramilitary had stationed its elite forces and stored ammunition in the former seat of government and symbol of Sudan’s state sovereignty, according to military sources. ‘Now the army has destroyed equipment, killed a number of their forces and seized control of one of its most important supply centres in Khartoum,’ the expert continued. In recent months, the army has appeared to turn the tide of the war, first advancing in central Sudan to reclaim territory before shifting focus to Khartoum. In January, it broke an almost two-year RSF siege of the General Command headquarters, allowing troops to merge with other battalions and encircle the RSF in the city centre. ‘What remained of RSF militias have fled into some buildings’ in central Khartoum, a military source said. Nearly two years of war has killed tens of thousands, displaced over 12 million, and triggered the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises.

{"title": "New Age | Ethiopian, Eritrean officials accused of war crimes during Tigray conflict", "body": "Eight survivors of the devastating conflict in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region have accused 12 high-ranking Ethiopian and Eritrean civilian and military officials of war crimes and crimes against humanity, the legal rights group representing them said on Monday. The Tigray region, bordering Eritrea, endured a war between 2020 and 2022 which claimed up to 6,00,000 lives, according to some estimates. The conflict pitted rebels of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front against federal Ethiopian forces, supported by local militias and the Eritrean army. Both sides were accused of committing atrocities, with the government sealing off Tigray for most of the war and restricting humanitarian aid to the region. The Swiss-based organisation did not disclose the identities of those accused in the filing, submitted in 2024 but announced last week. Eight survivors ‘have filed a groundbreaking criminal complaint with the German Federal Public Prosecutor, alleging that 12 senior Ethiopian and Eritrean government officials and military officers committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the conflict,’ non-profit Legal Action Worldwide said in a statement. A LAW spokesperson said on Monday they could not ‘confirm or deny’ whether Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed or Eritrean president Isaias Afwerki were mentioned. The case is being filed in Germany under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which allows the prosecution of crimes regardless of where they were committed, as they violate international law. Addis Ababa and Asmara did not respond to requests for comment from AFP. ‘We are asking the German authorities to open a criminal investigation, and to issue arrest warrants for 12 suspects,’ Nick Leddy, head of LAW’s strategic litigation department and a former prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, said. He said they would not be naming the suspects as it could ‘jeopardise the chances of their arrest’. The identities of the plaintiffs have not been made public either. ‘I’ve lost two of the most important people in my life in this war: my younger brother and my mom,’ LAW quoted one of them as saying. ‘The suffering and agony continues.’ ‘Tigrayans are still dying every day,’ they added, saying justice must be brought to those ‘who orchestrated and engineered these unimaginable crimes’. The two-year conflict was marked by allegations of massacres, mass rapes and other atrocities by all sides. In 2022, a United Nations commission said it had ‘reasonable grounds to believe that, in several instances, these violations amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity’. Anna Oehmichen, a lawyer involved in the case, said the ‘gravity of the crimes in Tigray are dramatic’. It requires investigation and prosecution, she said, ‘in order to put an end to the on-going violations of international law and to prevent other heads of state from committing similarly devastating crimes’. Although a peace agreement was signed in November 2022, around one million of the region’s pre-war population of six million remain displaced. In recent weeks, a rift within the TPLF has reignited fears of renewed conflict.

The Emergency Lawyers group of volunteer legal professionals who have documented atrocities on both sides of Sudan’s nearly two-year war said army warplanes carried out ‘an indiscriminate air strike on Tora market in North Darfur, killing hundreds of civilians and seriously wounding dozens’. It did not specify when the strike occurred. AFP could not independently verify the toll due to a telecommunications blackout in Darfur. The army, which has been fighting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in the conflict since April 2023, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The RSF, which controls nearly all of Darfur where the United States has accused it of committing genocide, said the army had committed the ‘massacre’ on Monday. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted more than 12 million and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. Darfur, a vast region the size of France, has faced some of the war’s worst violence, including reports of barrel bombs on civilian areas, paramilitary attacks on famine-hit displacement camps and rampant ethnic violence.

{"title": "New Age | ICJ sets April 10 for Sudan genocide case against UAE", "body": "The International Court of Justice on Friday set April 10 as the date for arguments from Sudan and the United Arab Emirates after Khartoum accused the Gulf State of complicity in genocide. Sudan has dragged the UAE before the court, arguing its alleged support for the rebel Rapid Support Forces makes it ‘complicit in the genocide on the Masalit’, a non-Arab ethnic group that has been a target of brutal violence in the Darfur region. The UAE, which has repeatedly denied supporting the RSF, has dismissed the case as a ‘publicity stunt’ and said it would try to have it thrown out. Sudan has called for so-called ‘provisional measures,’ urging the ICJ to issue emergency orders to force the UAE to pay reparations, among other requests. The orders of the ICJ, which rules in disputes between states, are legally binding but it has no direct power to enforce them. Khartoum urged the court to act quickly ‘to ensure the urgent and fullest possible protection for the Sudanese civilian people who remain at grave and immediate risk of continuing and further acts of genocide.’ ‘The United Arab Emirates fuels the rebellion and supports the militia that has committed the crime of genocide in West Darfur,’ according to Sudan’s submission to the court. For nearly two years, the RSF and the regular army in Sudan have fought a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 12 million. Famine has been declared in parts of the country and is likely to spread. In June, Sudan’s UN ambassador, Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith, accused the UAE of fomenting conflict in his country, saying the RSF was being ‘supported with weapons by the Emirates’. The RSF has received crucial support from the UAE, including arms deliveries through neighbouring Chad, say diplomats, analysts and rights groups. The Emirati envoy to the United Nations, Mohamed Issa Hamad Mohamed Abushahab, rejected the claims as ‘ludicrous’. The Gulf state promised the United States in December that it would not arm the RSF, after two US lawmakers attempted to block its purchase of $1.2 billion in advanced rockets and long-range missiles.

Ruwi village, where the attack happened, is in Plateau State, which lies on the internal border between the mostly-Muslim northern half of the country and the largely Christian south. It is a state that sees regular flare-ups of violence between nomadic herders and pastoral farmers. On Thursday night, unidentified men ‘came into the community shooting sporadically, and killed 10 people’, Moses John, a village leader, told AFP. ‘Three other people are injured and have been taken to the hospital. I can’t tell you exactly why we are attacked,’ added Joshua Maren, a villager who called on authorities to send ‘security personnel to come to our rescue’. The police spokesman for the Plateau State command, Alfred Alabo, confirmed the attack in a statement Friday, but did not comment on the number of victims. ‘The Command received a report of some unknown armed hoodlums who invaded Ruwi village at about 9:20pm Thursday and started shooting sporadically,’ he said. ‘As a result, some law abiding citizens of the community who were at a ceremony mourning the demise of their loved ones unfortunately lost their lives, while others secured varying degrees of injuries,’ he said. Joyce Ramnap, the state’s information commissioner, urged the country’s security forces ‘to hunt and track down the perpetrators of the heinous crimes and ensure justice for the victims’. Tensions have soared in the state since about 200 people were killed at Christmas 2023 during a bloody attack on a majority Christian village. In May last year, around 40 people were killed and homes torched in the town of Wase.

The Emergency Lawyers, a group of volunteer legal professionals, said that ‘the RSF attacked more than 15 villages’ south of the Khartoum area. It reported dozens killed and hundreds wounded. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, has been battling the army, led by Sudan’s de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, since April 2023. The regular army declared last Thursday that it had regained full control of Khartoum, a day after Burhan announced that the capital had been ‘liberated’ from the RSF. Daglo acknowledges on Sunday that the RSF had withdrawn from Khartoum, after weeks of fierce battles with the army. The war has created what the United Nations describes as the world’s worst hunger and displacement crises. More than 12 million people have been uprooted, tens of thousands killed, and a UN-backed assessment declared famine in parts of the country. Despite the army reclaiming Khartoum, Africa’s third-largest country remains essentially divided in two by the war.

{"title": "New Age | 7 Ethiopian journalists detained over terrorism allegations: CPJ", "body": "At least seven journalists have been detained on terrorism allegations, an international journalism monitor said, after they aired a story accusing men in military uniforms of raping a woman in 2020. The east African giant of some 130 million people is regularly criticised by human rights NGOs for the repression of dissenting voices. The country ranks 141st out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders 2024 press freedom index, which cites ‘widespread self-censorship’. The Committee to Protect Journalists said late on Wednesday that seven people were detained in late March after the Ethiopian Broadcasting Service broadcast a woman’s claims ‘to have been abducted and raped by men in military uniform while she was a student in 2020’. The woman later retracted her statements on a state-owned channel. EBS’s founder apologised, saying the station ‘discovered that the allegations were fabricated after the programme aired’, according to the CPJ. According to court documents reviewed by the CPJ, police allege that the journalists ‘sought to incite conflict, threaten the constitutional order, and overthrow the government in coordination with ‘extremist’ groups’ in the Amhara region. The journalists, along with the woman who made the accusations, were remanded in custody pending a 14-day investigation. ‘Arresting journalists on terrorism allegations is a disproportionate response to concerns over lapses in journalistic ethics,’ said CPJ Africa programme coordinator Muthoki Mumo. Amhara, the country’s second-most populated region, has recently seen a surge in violence. In April 2023, a local group called the Fano went from being allies of the federal government to launching an armed rebellion. Despite the government placing the region under a state of emergency from August 2023 to June 2024, the unrest did not stop and authorities sent in military reinforcements in September. Today, a large part of Amhara is beyond the control of the federal authorities and fighting has intensified in recent weeks.

Eastern DR Congo has been wracked by decades of conflict, but tensions have been heightened in recent months by the advance of the M23 armed group which the international community says is backed by Rwanda. Kigali denies the accusations. ‘The rate of sexual violence against children has never been higher,’ warned James Elder of the United Nations children’s agency UNICEF, demanding action. ‘Early reports show that children make up between 35 to 45 percent of the nearly 10,000 cases of rape and sexual violence reported... in just January and February of this year,’ he told reporters in Geneva, speaking from Goma. ‘In short, based on initial data, ... during the most intense phase of this year’s conflict in eastern DRC, a child was raped every half an hour.’ The conflict has killed thousands, driven vast numbers from their homes and left children even more vulnerable to the rampant sexual violence that has plagued the region for years. ‘We are not talking about isolated incidents,’ Elder said, decrying ‘a systemic crisis’. ‘We are seeing survivors as young as toddlers. It is a weapon of war and a deliberate tactic of terror. And it destroys families and communities.’ Elder stressed that the horrifying numbers could ‘just the tip of the iceberg, hidden beneath layers of fear, stigma, and insecurity’. This, he said, ‘should shake us to our core. Certainly it should compel urgent and collective action’. Elder called for ‘additional prevention efforts, survivor-centred services, and safe, accessible ways for survivors to report abuse without fear’. ‘Survivors must see the world stand with them, not turn away.

Shelling and intense gunfire by the Rapid Support Forces hit ‘Zamzam displacement camp from both the southern and eastern directions’, said the local resistance committee, a volunteer aid group in the besieged North Darfur state capital of El-Fasher. Zamzam and other densely populated camps for the displaced around El-Fasher have suffered heavily during nearly two years of fighting between the regular army and the RSF. El-Fasher is the only state capital still under army control in Darfur, making it a strategic prize in the RSF’s push for full control of the west. Witnesses described seeing RSF combat vehicles entering the Zamzam camp under cover of heavy gunfire. The attack on Zamzam comes a day after RSF shelling of nearby Abu Shouk camp killed at least 15 people, rescuers said. Three El-Fasher residents told AFP that the RSF attacked the city on Friday from the east, south and west, after bombarding it with heavy artillery and rockets. They spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern for their own safety. Drones were also seen bombing central El-Fasher, witnesses said. The paramilitaries have stepped up efforts to complete their conquest of Darfur since losing control of the capital Khartoum last month. Zamzam was the first part of Sudan where a UN-backed assessment declared famine last year. In December, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification said famine had since spread to two nearby camps—Abu Shouk and Al Salam—as well as to parts of the country’s south. The war between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, erupted in April 2023. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 12 million. While the army recaptured the capital Khartoum late last month, Africa’s third-largest country remains divided. The army holds sway in the east and north, while the RSF controls most of Darfur and parts of the south. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk warned on Friday of deeply catastrophic consequences for civilians as the conflict approaches its third year. ‘Two years of this brutal and senseless conflict must be a wake-up call to the parties to lay down their weapons and for the international community to act,’ he said. ‘Sudan must not remain on this destructive path.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/262112/paramilitary-attack-on-sudan-famine-hit-camp-kills-25", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 436}
{"title": "New Age | Sudan paramilitaries kill 56 over two days in Darfur town", "body": "Sudan’s paramilitaries killed 56 civilians over two days in attacks on a newly-retaken town on the road to El-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur still in army hands, activists said on Sunday. The killings, which occurred on April 11 and 12, targeted residents in Um Kadadah, around 180 kilometres east of El-Fasher, ‘on an ethnic basis’, said the local resistance committee, part of a network of volunteers coordinating aid across Sudan since the war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces began on April 15, 2023. The RSF have stepped up attacks in the El-Fasher area since the army last month recaptured the capital Khartoum, around 1,000 kilometres to the east. The committee’s report came a day after the United Nations said more than 100 people were feared dead in RSF attacks on El-Fasher and two nearby famine-hit camps for displaced people. The attacks on Um Kadadah came one day after RSF fighters said they seized the town from army forces. The local committee shared a list of those killed and said that the RSF committed ‘widespread violations’ and citizens ‘were forcibly displaced’ from the town. The paramilitaries shut down all telecommunications there, the committee added. Victims included the town’s hospital director, the committee said, adding that at least 14 people remain missing. The United States has sanctioned both sides in the war, saying the RSF had ‘committed genocide’ in Darfur, but also that the army had attacked civilians during the war. The conflict has essentially divided Sudan in two, killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and created what the International Rescue Committee described as ‘the biggest humanitarian crisis ever recorded’.

{"title": "New Age | Attackers kill nearly 50 in Plateau state of Nigeria", "body": "Unidentified attackers have killed nearly 50 people in Nigeria’s Plateau state, a Red Cross source said Monday, in the latest bout of violence in a religiously mixed region known for intercommunal conflict and deadly land disputes. The Sunday night attack on the villages of Zike and Kimakpa, in the Bassa local government area, comes less than two weeks after armed men struck multiple villages in the Bokkos area, also in Plateau state, killing 48. Land disputes, often between Muslim Fulani herders and mostly Christian farmers, are prone to descend into deadly violence in Plateau, especially in rural areas where law enforcement is largely absent and impunity is widespread. ‘I can confirm to you that 47 persons have died, 22 others were injured and taken to hospital, five houses were burnt down,’ the Red Cross official told AFP. Dorcas John, a resident of Zike, told AFP: ‘The attackers, unknown to us, came into the community and were shooting anywhere, and they killed eight people.’ John Adamu, of Kimakpa, said the attackers killed 39 people in his village. The motive for the killings and the identity of the attackers were unknown as of Monday. Police officials did not respond to a request for comment. Though millions of Nigerians of different backgrounds live side by side, intercommunal violence often flares in Plateau state. Researchers say that drivers of conflict in Plateau are often complicated. As Africa’s most populous country has continued to grow, so has the amount of land that farmers use, while grazing routes have come under stress from climate change. Land grabbing and political and economic tensions between local ‘indigenes’ and those considered outsiders, as well as the influx of hardline Muslim and Christian preachers have heightened divisions in recent decades. When violence flares, weak policing all but guarantees reprisal attacks, experts say. Last week, army troops recovered the headless body of a 16-year Fulani herder who went missing in the Bassa area. His cattle were also stolen. After the killings in Bokkos earlier this month, a local official told reporters that the violence was the result of ‘ethnic and religious cleansing’ by attackers ‘speaking the Fulani dialect’. A local herder association slammed the remarks, saying that the Fulfulde language, as it is formally known, is widely spoken in the country, ‘even (by) criminals’. The Plateau state government condemned the most recent killings ‘in strong terms’, calling them ‘unprovoked.’ The state commissioner of information and communication, Joyce Ramnap, said that the ‘series of attacks pose an existential threat to the lives and livelihoods of the peace-loving people of the state’.

{"title": "New Age | Nations call for immediate end to ‘horrific’ Sudan war", "body": "The UK led international calls Tuesday for a swift end to the devastating war in Sudan, hosting a gathering of world officials with fresh pledges of humanitarian aid as the conflict which has cost thousands of lives entered its third year. The war erupted on April 15, 2023 in a bitter power struggle between rival generals leading Sudan’s regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces — neither of whom were present at the conference. More than 13 million people have been uprooted and tens of thousands killed, with both sides accused of committing atrocities. It has created what the United Nations describes as the world’s worst hunger and displacement crises. ‘We simply cannot look away,’ the UK’s foreign minister David Lammy said as he opened the talks among counterparts from around 15 countries, denouncing what he called ‘a lack of political will’ to end the fighting. ‘We have got to persuade the warring parties to protect civilians, to let aid in and across the country, and to put peace first,’ he said, adding it would take ‘patient diplomacy’. Various peace efforts have so far failed to lead to a ceasefire. The continued fighting has fuelled fears the tensions will spill over Sudan’s borders and stir further instability in the impoverished Horn of Africa region. ‘There can be no military solution in Sudan, only an immediate, unconditional secession of hostilities,’ said the African Union’s commissioner for political affairs, Bankole Adeoye. ‘This, we believe, must be followed by an all-inclusive dialogue to end the war.’ The war has ‘shattered the lives of millions of children across Sudan,’ said Catherine Russell, executive director of UNICEF, which estimated 2,776 children had been killed or maimed in 2023 and 2024. A UN-backed assessment has concluded that famine is now blighting parts of the country. Britain’s foreign ministry said more than 30 million people were in desperate need, and 12 million women and girls were in danger of gender-based violence. Lammy unveiled 120 million pounds (140 million euros) in new aid for Sudan, with the EU pledging more than 522 million euros ($591 million) to address the crisis, and Germany putting up some 125 million euros. France also announced an extra 50 million euros in humanitarian aid this year. ‘How can we forget the world’s largest humanitarian crisis?’ asked German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock. During a visit to a refugee camp, she said she heard ‘horrific reports of women and children being raped’ while people were dying of hunger. Germany and France as well as the European Union and the 55-member African Union are co-hosting the conference with the British government in London. Ministers from some 14 other countries including Saudi Arabia and the United States were attending, the Foreign Office said, along with high-level representatives from bodies such as the United Nations. Sudan’s government has protested that it was not invited to participate, soliciting a rebuke from Khartoum. But the German foreign ministry said both the Sudanese army and the RSF militia were unwilling to come to the table. Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of supporting the paramilitary forces with arms shipments. Those fighters and the Gulf state deny the charges. In a statement Tuesday, the UAE issued ‘an urgent call for peace’ and accused both sides of ‘committing atrocities’. It said a senior foreign ministry official would attend the London conference. French foreign minister Jean-Noel Barrot stressed ‘the unity of Sudan must be preserved’ and there could be no unilateral government imposed on civilians. The conflict pits the regular army of Sudan’s de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the RSF led by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. It was triggered when relations between Burhan and Daglo soured following a 2021 coup that ousted the transitional government put in place after the 2019 overthrow of longtime leader Omar al-Bashir. The RSF are rooted in Darfur and control much of its territory, as well as parts of Sudan’s south. The army reclaimed the capital Khartoum last month, and holds sway in the east and north, leaving Africa’s third-largest country divided in two.

{"title": "New Age | Somali-US air strike kills 12", "body": "Somali and US forces carried out an air strike on an area under attack from the Al-Shabaab Islamist group and killed 12 militants, the Somali government said on Thursday. The strike on Adan Yabaal, 220 kilometres north of the capital Mogadishu came as Al-Shabaab fighters raided the key town used as a base by Somali military commanders. Growing attacks by the al-Qaeda-linked group, including one on President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s convoy, are fuelling worries of a jihadist resurgence after militants were forced back in recent years. The strike on Wednesday night by Somali armed forces and the US Africa Command ‘aimed to neutralise the threat posed’ by Al Shabaab, the information ministry said in a statement posted on X. ‘The targeted strike hit a site used by the militants as a gathering and hideout,’ it said. ‘Preliminary reports indicate that 12 operatives, including senior leaders, were eliminated.’ Somali government forces took control of Adan Yabaal from Al-Shabaab in December 2022 during the major offensive backed by African Union peacekeeping forces. On Wednesday, Al-Shabaab launched a dawn raid on the town, with bombs loaded on trucks detonating before militants fought their way into the town, a military official said. The official said the army was getting reinforcements from nearby positions to defend the town, but Al-Shabaab claimed its fighters had overrun the Somalia military and controlled Adan Yabaal. AFP was unable to confirm those claims. Two local residents said that militants had taken Adan Yabaal. The president had visited the town recently, with state media reporting he had met with military commanders to review the on-going military offensive against Al-Shabaab. In the southwest, Somali forces and allies killed 35 militants around Baidoa town in the early hours of Thursday, after they attempted to attack an army base there, the ministry said. Earlier this month, Al-Shabaab fired multiple mortar rounds near Mogadishu’s airport, disrupting international flights. Halane camp — a fortified compound that houses the United Nations, aid agencies, foreign missions and the headquarters of the African Union’s Support and Stabilisation Mission in Somalia — was also targeted. The group has seized key locations in Middle and Lower Shabelle, coastal regions on either side of Mogadishu. A bomb blast that narrowly missed the convoy of president Mohamud in March underscored that Al-Shabaab again poses a risk in the capital itself. Al-Shabaab has been fighting the government for 15 years, but the African Union-led peacekeeping force helped push the jihadists onto the defensive in 2022 and 2023.

{"title": "New Age | 143 killed in DR Congo boat fire", "body": "At least 143 people died and dozens more went missing after a boat carrying fuel caught fire and capsized in the Democratic Republic of Congo, officials said Friday. Hundreds of passengers were crowded onto a wooden boat on the Congo River in northwest DRC on Tuesday when the blaze broke out, according to Josephine-Pacifique Lokumu, head of a delegation of national deputies from the region. The disaster occurred near Mbandaka, capital of Equateur Province, at the confluence of the Ruki and the vast Congo river—the world’s deepest. ‘A first group of 131 bodies were found on Wednesday, with a further 12 fished out on Thursday and Friday. Several of them are charred,’ Lokumu told AFP. Joseph Lokondo, a local civil society leader who said he helped bury the bodies, put the ‘provisional death toll at 145: some burned, others drowned’. Lokumu said the blaze was caused by a fuel explosion ignited by an onboard cooking fire. ‘A woman lit the embers for cooking. The fuel, which was not far away, exploded, killing many children and women’, she said. Videos circulating on social media showed flames leaping from a long boat stranded far from shore, with smoke billowing from the wreckage and people aboard smaller vessels looking on. The total number of passengers on board the doomed vessel was not known but Lokumu said it was in the ‘hundreds’. Some survivors were rescued and admitted to hospital, Lokondo said. But on Friday, he added, ‘several families were still without news of their loved ones’. A vast Central African nation that covers 2.3 million square kilometres, the DRC suffers from a lack of practicable roads and planes serve only a limited number of cities and towns. As a result, people often travel on lakes, the Congo River—the second longest in Africa after the Nile—and its winding tributaries, where shipwrecks are frequent and the death tolls often heavy. A chronic absence of passenger lists often complicates search operations. In October 2023, at least 47 people died after a boat navigating the Congo sank in Equateur. More than 20 people died in October last year when a boat capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern DRC, according to local authorities. Another shipwreck on Lake Kivu claimed around 100 lives in 2019.

A local Mongo official, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, said prisoners broke into a manager’s office to steal guns. ‘A shootout with guards ensued, at the same time the governor arrived. He was wounded,’ he said. The Mongo official confirmed there were three dead, and put the total number of escaped prisoners at 132.

{"title": "New Age | Tunisian opposition leaders jailed in mass trial", "body": "A Tunisian court handed down jail sentences of up to 66 years to multiple defendants, including prominent opposition figures, for national security offences, local media and a defence lawyer said Saturday. The trial, criticised by rights groups and decried by a defence lawyer as a ‘masquerade’, is of unprecedented scale with around 40 defendants including vocal critics of President Kais Saied. They were found guilty of ‘conspiracy against state security’ and ‘belonging to a terrorist group’, and received sentences ranging from 13 to 66 years, an official from the anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office told media outlets including Jahwara FM. Among those sentenced were well-known opposition figures, lawyers and business people, with some already in prison for two years while others were in exile or still free. Issam Chebbi and Jawhar Ben Mbarek of the opposition National Salvation Front coalition, as well as lawyer Ridha Belhaj and activist Chaima Issa were sentenced to 18 years behind bars, defence lawyer Abdessatar Messaoudi told AFP. Activists Khayam Turki was handed a 48-year term while businessman Kamel Eltaief received the harshest penalty of 66 years in prison, added the lawyer. Kamel Jendoubi, a rights advocate and former minister tried in absentia, slammed what he called a ‘judicial assassination’ by the courts. ‘This is not a judiciary ruling, but a political decree executed by judges under orders, by complicit prosecutors and by a justice minister’ who all serve ‘a paranoid autocrat’, charged Jendoubi. Since Saied launched a power grab in the summer of 2021, during which he assumed total control, rights advocates and opposition figures have decried a rollback of freedoms in the North African country where the 2011 Arab Spring began. On Friday evening, defence lawyers denounced the trial after the judge finished reading the accusations and began deliberation without hearing from either the prosecution or the defence. Samia Abbou, one of the lawyers, told AFP that there were ‘flagrant violations of judicial procedure’ with the accused ‘not heard’, denouncing it as a ‘masquerade’. The hearing lasted much of the day, with media barred from the proceedings, along with foreign diplomats who had previously been admitted. Since proceedings began on March 4, lawyers for the defence have repeatedly called for all the defendants to appear in court, including at least six who have been on hunger strike. The lawyers denounced the case as ‘empty’, while Human Rights Watch said the trial was taking place in the context of repression with President Saied ‘weaponising the judicial system to target opponents and dissidents’. Analyst Hatem Natfi said in a post on X that any acquittal in the mass trial ‘would have negated the conspiratorial narrative that the regime has relied on since 2021’ and ‘accepted by a large part of the population’ relying on restricted media coverage.

{"title": "New Age | Paramilitary shelling kills 30 in Sudan city", "body": "Paramilitary shelling on Sudan’s besieged city of El-Fasher, in the western region of Darfur, killed more than 30 civilians and wounded dozens more, activists said on Monday. The attack, which took place on Sunday, involved ‘heavy artillery shelling’ and targeted the city’s residential neighbourhoods, said the local resistance committee, one of hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating aid across Sudan. Since April 2023, the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in a brutal war. El-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, remains the last major city in the vast Darfur region that the paramilitary group has not conquered. Last week, the RSF launched a renewed offensive on the city and two nearby displacement camps — Zamzam and Abu Shouk — killing over 400 and displacing some 4,00,000 people, according to the United Nations. In a bloody ground offensive, the RSF took control of Zamzam camp — where up to one million people were sheltering according to aid sources. Following the army’s recapture of the capital Khartoum last month, the RSF has intensified efforts to seize El-Fasher, raising fears of a devastating urban battle and a new wave of displacement. The war in Sudan, now in its third year, has killed tens of thousands, displaced 13 million and created what the UN describes as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The conflict has effectively divided the country in two with the army holding the centre, east and north while the RSF controls nearly all of Darfur and, with its allies, parts of the south.

The world’s youngest nation, which is deeply impoverished, has long been troubled by insecurity and instability. But recent fighting between factions allied to president Salva Kiir and his long-time rival vice-president Riek Machar have sparked worries of renewed war. International observers fear a return to the five-year civil war that cost some 4,00,000 lives and was ended by a 2018 peace deal which brought the two together in a unity government, but which appears to be unravelling. Clashes between the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-in Opposition in neighbouring Morobo and Yei counties in Central Equatoria State ‘have led to civilian displacement and casualties’, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan said. The state includes the capital, Juba, and under the 2018 agreement was split into areas controlled by government and opposition forces. Pro-Machar forces denounced government attacks on a military cantonment in the area earlier this week, urging civilians to leave. The army did not comment. The UN did not give further details of the clashes, but urged an ‘immediate cessation of hostilities’, especially given the ‘already fragile political and security conditions’. Morobo County Commissioner Charles Data Bullen said the situation in the area ‘remains volatile’. Margret Ileli, 28, said she heard gunshots nearby on Tuesday afternoon ‘and we started running leaving everything behind’. She was now sheltering in Morobo town but said: ‘I am confused and I don’t know what to do next.’ Charles Likambo, 30, was also displaced with his family of five, telling AFP he was forced to abandon his crops and goats. ‘Me and my family have not received any food assistance, and my children keep on crying because they are hungry,’ he said, urging humanitarian organisations to help.

That result marks a five-per cent increase on his score in the provisional results given the day after the April 12 ballot, the country’s first since Oligui ended more than five decades of Bongo dynasty rule in his August 2023 coup. Oligui, who temporarily hung up his general’s uniform to stand for office, was elected president in a single round with 588,074 ballots, according to the electoral commission’s final results. His main rival Alain-Claude Bilie By Nze, the last prime minister under ousted leader Ali Bongo Ondimba, likewise saw an increase in his vote share, coming second with 3.11 per cent compared to his provisional 3.02 per cent score. None of the six other candidates broke the one-per cent barrier. Turnout stood at 70.11 per cent in an election marking Gabon’s return to constitutional normality and civilian rule after 19 months under Oligui’s military leadership. No appeal against the election’s fairness and conduct had been lodged within the deadline, the electoral commission added. While he chose not to appeal against the outcome of the vote, the day after the provisional results’ release Bilie By Nze slammed a “victory snatched away in opaque and contestable conditions” and a lack of equity in the campaign period. Neither patriarch Omar Bongo, who ruled from 1967 to 2009, nor his son Ali Bongo, ever obtained vote shares as large as that scooped by Oligui, besides the three elections in 1973, 1979 and 1986 where Bongo senior was the sole candidate. Oligui, who will on Saturday attend the funeral of Pope Francis, is set to be sworn in on May 3 in the Gabonese capital Libreville, according to the presidency.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan violence may be crimes against humanity: UK", "body": "Violence in Sudan’s Darfur region shows ‘the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and may amount to crimes against humanity,’ UK foreign minister David Lammy said. Lammy called on the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces to ‘de-escalate urgently’ and said in a statement issued early Friday that Britain would continue to ‘use all tools available to us to hold those responsible for atrocities to account’. Paramilitary shelling of the besieged city of El-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, has killed more than 30 civilians and wounded dozens more, activists said on Monday. El-Fasher is the last major city in the vast Darfur region that still remains in army control. Lammy said that reports of the violence in and around El-Fasher were ‘appalling’. ‘Last week, the UK gathered the international community in London to call for an end to the suffering of the Sudanese people. ‘Yet some of the violence in Darfur has shown the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing and may amount to crimes against humanity,’ he said. He called on the RSF to ‘halt its siege of El-Fasher’, adding that ‘the warring parties have a responsibility to end this suffering.’ Lammy also urged the Sudanese Armed Forces to allow safe passage for civilians to reach safety. International aid agencies have long warned that a full-scale RSF assault on El-Fasher could lead to devastating urban warfare and a new wave of mass displacement. UNICEF has described the situation as ‘hell on earth’ for at least 825,000 children trapped in and around El-Fasher.

{"title": "New Age | 542 killed in North Darfur in past three weeks: UN", "body": "At least 542 civilians have been confirmed killed in Sudan’s North Darfur region in the past three weeks, the United Nations said on Thursday, warning the actual death toll was likely ‘much higher’. ‘The horror unfolding in Sudan knows no bounds,’ UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement, referring to the country’s on-going civil war. Darfur in particular has become a key battleground in the war that erupted on April 15, 2023 between the regular army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces, headed by his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. The war has left tens of thousands dead and triggered what aid agencies describe as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. The battle for El-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur to elude RSF control, has intensified in recent weeks as the paramilitaries have sought to compensate for their loss of the capital Khartoum last month. Turk pointed to an attack three days ago by the RSF on El-Fasher and the Abu Shouk camp that killed at least 40 civilians. ‘This brings the confirmed number of civilians killed in North Darfur to at least 542 in just the last three weeks,’ he said. ‘The actual death toll is likely much higher.’ He also cited ‘the ominous warning by the RSF of ‘bloodshed’ ahead of imminent battles with the Sudanese Armed Forces and their associated armed movements.’ ‘Everything must be done to protect civilians trapped amid dire conditions in and around El-Fasher.’ Turk also highlighted ‘reports of extrajudicial executions in Khartoum state’, which he described as ‘extremely disturbing’. ‘Horrific videos circulating on social media show at least 30 men in civilian clothing being rounded up and executed by armed men in RSF uniforms in Al-Salha in southern Omdurman,’ he said, adding that in a subsequent video, ‘an RSF field commander acknowledged the killings.’ Those videos came after ‘shocking reports in recent weeks of the extrajudicial execution of dozens of people accused of collaborating with the RSF in southern Khartoum, allegedly committed by the Al-Baraa Brigade’, a pro-SAF militia, Turk said. ‘Deliberately taking the life of a civilian or anyone no longer directly taking part in hostilities is a war crime,’ he insisted. The UN rights chief said he had ‘personally alerted both leaders of the RSF and SAF to the catastrophic human rights consequences of this war’. ‘These harrowing consequences are a daily, lived reality for millions of Sudanese. It is well past time for this conflict to stop.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/263823/542-killed-in-north-darfur-in-past-three-weeks-un", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 445}

Echorouk News TV used the derogatory word in a Facebook post after police raids in which migrants from sub-Saharan Africa were detained. The ANIRA broadcasting authority called the publication ‘extremely serious’. The report contained ‘a racist and discriminatory term, an attack on human dignity, conveying hate speech against a category of people because of their race,’ said ANIRA which demanded that the channel’s management make an official apology. Tens of thousands of undocumented African migrants have used Algeria as a staging post to attempt to get to Europe. Many have sought jobs in the North African country. Since the start of April, Algeria has expelled some 5,000 Africans to neighbouring Niger, according to state television. About half were from Niger.

{"title": "New Age | Outcry as Kenya arrests filmmakers", "body": "Rights groups condemned on Saturday the arrest of four Kenyan filmmakers which the activists linked to a BBC documentary about police killings during protests last year. The four independent filmmakers—Nicholas Wambugu Gichuki, Brian Adagala, Mark Karubiu and Chris Wamae—were arrested on Friday, the eve of World Press Freedom Day, in the capital Nairobi and charged with ‘publishing false information’. The BBC said in a statement that none of them was involved in the making of ‘Blood Parliament’, a documentary published last week that identified security officers who killed protesters during mass anti-tax demonstrations in June 2024. But rights groups suggested there was a link to the uproar over the film, which has received huge interest in Kenya and led some politicians to call for the British broadcaster’s expulsion from the country. Rights groups condemned Friday’s arrests. ‘We call on the National Police Services to concentrate its vast investigative resources on finding and charging the Kenyan Defence services and police officers identified in the BBC Blood Parliament documentary,’ said the Police Reforms Working Group, a coalition of Kenyan and international rights groups. ‘This is where the public interest lies.’ The four were released on Saturday but must appear in court on Monday to face charges of publishing false information. Interviews with two of those arrested were published online by Africa Uncensored, an independent Kenyan media house. Wambugu said the police took all their laptops, hard drives and phones. During the interrogation, police asked him if he had ‘done anything that speaks against government?’ he said. ‘They didn’t mention the BBC doc... but it’s not coming from just anywhere,’ Wambugu added. At least 60 people were killed during weeks of protests that began in June over tax rises in a finance bill from the government of President William Ruto. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights says at least 89 people were also abducted by shadowy elements of the security services in the following weeks and months, many held for long periods in secret, with 29 still missing.

{"title": "New Age | MSF’s hospital bombed in S Sudan", "body": "Doctors Without Borders said one of its hospitals in South Sudan had been bombed early on Saturday, with local officials reporting at least four dead in the area. South Sudan has descended into renewed conflict in recent months due to the collapse of a power-sharing agreement between rival generals, president Salva Kiir and first vice-president Riek Machar. MSF said its hospital in Old Fangak in the north of the country had been bombed at about 4:00am local time. ‘The pharmacy was destroyed. All medical supplies lost. There are reports of people killed and injured,’ the medical charity said in a statement posted on Facebook. The bombing came a day after army chief Paul Majok Nang threatened attacks in Fangak and Leer counties in response to a number of boats and barges being ‘hijacked’. An army statement on Friday accused members of Machar’s forces and its allies in the so-called White Army, a militia drawn from the vice president’s ethnic Nuer community, of being behind the hijackings, which led to passengers and crew being ‘held hostage’ and ransoms demanded. Biel Boutros Biel, a local official in Fangak County, confirmed that bombings had hit the area around 4 am on Saturday. In a recorded statement, he said they were carried out by a drone and plane, displacing ‘over 30,000 people’ and killing at least four, including a nine-month-old boy. ‘These planes belonged to the government of South Sudan.’ ‘The pharmacy of MSF has been burned to ashes... There are a lot of casualties,’ he added, saying there were at least 25 wounded at the hospital. AFP could not independently verify the information. MSF said it was the only functioning hospital in the area. ‘Hospitals are not a target. Stop the bombing.’ Last week, an opposition lawmaker accused president Kiir’s government of preparing a ‘genocide’ of the Nuer community by classifying their homelands as ‘hostile’. A government statement listed nine out of 16 Nuer-majority counties as ‘considered hostile’, meaning aligned with Machar’s party. South Sudan has been plagued by instability since gaining independence from Sudan in 2011. Kiir and Machar represent the two largest ethnic groups, the Dinka and Nuer, respectively. They fought a civil war between 2013 and 2018 that cost some 400,000 lives.

{"title": "New Age | Drone strikes rock Port Sudan in 3rd day of attacks", "body": "Drones struck the airport and knocked out power across Port Sudan on Tuesday, officials said, the third straight day the Sudanese army-aligned government’s seat of power has come under attack. The strikes, which also targeted an army base, come a day after the country’s main fuel depot was hit, causing a massive blaze just south of the eastern city which had until Sunday been considered a safe-haven for hundreds of thousands of displaced people fleeing the two-year war. An AFP correspondent reported loud explosions at dawn and plumes of smoke over the Red Sea coastal city, one blast heard from the direction of the port and another from a fuel depot just south. One drone hit ‘the civilian section of the Port Sudan airport’, an airport official said, two days after the facility’s military base was first attacked in drone strikes the army blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The RSF — born out of the Janjaweed militia accused of genocide in Darfur more than two decades ago — has not claimed the drone attacks. Air traffic was halted at the war-torn country’s only airport still handling international civilian flights, the source said. Another drone targeted the main army base in the city centre, an army source said, and witnesses said a nearby major hotel was hit. Both sites are close to the residence of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who has been at war with his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the RSF commander, since April 2023. A third drone hit a fuel depot near the southern port in the densely populated city centre, where the UN, aid agencies and hundreds of thousands of displaced people have relocated from Khartoum. Later in the morning, drones hit Port Sudan’s main power substation, the national electricity company said, causing a blackout across the city. AFP photos showed thick black smoke billowing over Port Sudan’s skyline after the strikes. Witnesses in the city’s north reported anti-aircraft fire from a military base. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The attacks have disrupted daily life in the city. Car queues stretched for more than a kilometre outside the few fuel stations still operating as motorists scrambled to fill their tanks amid growing fears of supply disruptions. The RSF has increasingly relied on drones since losing territory including nearly all of Khartoum in March, attacking deep into army-held territory. On Monday, UN chief Antonio Guterres said reports of paramilitary attacks on Port Sudan were a ‘worrying development threatening the protection of civilians and humanitarian operations’. Nearly all humanitarian aid into Sudan, where famine has already been declared and nearly 25 million people suffer dire food insecurity, arrives through Port Sudan. From the airport, where Sudanese airlines had resumed flights after the first drone strike on Sunday, ‘fires broke out in multiple buildings’ following the latest explosion, a traveller said. The army source said that strike had also ‘targeted fuel depots at the airport’. The RSF has in recent weeks attacked civilian infrastructure across the army-controlled northeast, causing widespread blackouts for millions of people. Sudan’s war has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted 13 million and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. It has effectively split the country in two, with the army controlling the centre, north and east while the RSF holds nearly all of the vast western region of Darfur and, with its allies, parts of the south. According to experts, the RSF’s increased reliance on drones after it lost Khartoum serves to both telegraph its reach and hinder the army’s supply lines. The RSF has used both makeshift and highly advanced drones, which Sudan’s army has accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying. Sudan’s army-aligned information minister, Khalid al-Aiser, accused the UAE of supplying the drones used in the attack to ‘its proxy’, the RSF, describing the assault as ‘criminal and terrorist’. The International Court of Justice on Monday threw out a case brought by Sudan against the UAE, accusing it of complicity in genocide by supporting the RSF. The army-aligned foreign ministry said Tuesday it ‘respected’ the ruling based on the ICJ’s lack of jurisdiction due to the UAE’s 2005 ‘reservation’ on the UN Genocide Convention. But it added the court’s refusal to hear the case ‘cannot legally be interpreted as a denial of the violations, nor does it represent any acquittal of the UAE from its involvement in genocide’. The foreign ministry vowed to continue pursuing legal avenues, saying: ‘The legal battle against those attacking Sudan is not over.’ Egypt, which shares a border with Sudan, condemned Tuesday’s latest attacks. Cairo warned of ‘the danger of the latest escalation’ and its severe impact on ‘ceasefire efforts, protection of civilians and boosting the delivery of humanitarian aid’ to the war-torn country.

{"title": "New Age | UAE supplying Sudan paramilitaries with Chinese weapons: AI", "body": "Chinese-made weapons supplied by the United Arab Emirates have been identified with Sudan’s paramilitaries, Amnesty International said Thursday, as drone attacks prompted civilians to flee the army-held aid hub of Port Sudan. The Britain-based watchdog said that its research had detailed the use by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces of sophisticated Chinese-made artillery and guided bombs in its war with the regular army, now in its third year. Abu Dhabi has repeatedly denied arming the RSF, despite reports from UN experts, US politicians and international organisations. Amnesty said its research was based on weapons used by the RSF in operations in the western region Darfur and during its loss of the capital Khartoum in March. It did not say anything about the long-range drones used by the paramilitaries to attack army-controlled cities in the east and south in recent days. ‘Sophisticated Chinese weaponry, re-exported by the United Arab Emirates, has been captured in Khartoum, as well as used in Darfur in a blatant breach of the existing UN arms embargo,’ Amnesty said. It said it identified ‘Chinese GB50A guided bombs and 155mm AH-4 howitzers’ through analysis of video footage and photos of RSF attacks. It said ‘the only country in the world that has imported AH-4 howitzers from China is the UAE’ in a 2019 deal, relying on data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Amnesty’s report came as the RSF pressed its long-range drone attacks on army-held cities. On Thursday morning, drones targeted the country’s main naval base just north of Port Sudan, seat of the army-backed government, as well as fuel depots in the southern city of Kosti, two sources said. ‘The militia launched another drone attack on the Flamingo Naval Base north of Port Sudan,’ one source said, referring to the RSF. He said air defences had shot down 15 drones overnight. Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast had been regarded as a safe haven, hosting United Nations offices and hundreds of thousands of displaced people, until drone strikes blamed on the RSF began on Sunday. The port city is the main entry point for humanitarian aid into hunger-stricken Sudan, and UN chief Antonio Guterres warned the attacks ‘threaten to increase humanitarian needs and further complicate aid operations’, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. More than two years of war have killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted 13 million, according to UN figures. On Tuesday, the army-backed government severed ties with the UAE, accusing it of supplying the RSF with the advanced weapons systems it has used to strike Port Sudan. The UAE denied the allegation, adding that the internationally recognised administration ‘does not represent the legitimate government of Sudan’. Since losing nearly all of greater Khartoum to the army in March, the RSF has ramped up their use of long-range drones. The strikes on Port Sudan have hit key facilities including the country’s last functioning international airport, its largest working fuel depot and the city’s main power station. At Port Sudan’s bustling main bus station, civilians were scrambling to leave. ‘You can’t get a ticket without booking over a day in advance now, all the buses are booked,’ said bus company employee Mahmoud Hussein. Among those fleeing was Haidar Ibrahim, preparing to travel south with his family. ‘The smoke is everywhere and my wife suffers from asthma,’ he said. ‘We have no choice but to leave.’ Many of those who had sought refuge in Port Sudan have been displaced multiple times. The war has effectively split the country in two, with the army holding the north, east and centre, and the RSF in control of most of Darfur and parts of the south.

{"title": "New Age | 33 killed in RSF strikes in Sudan", "body": "At least 33 people have been killed in Sudan in attacks blamed on the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, at war with the army since April 2023, first responders said Saturday. The attacks came after six straight days of RSF drone strikes on the army-led government’s wartime capital Port Sudan damaged key infrastructure including the power grid and the country’s last operational civilian airport. On Friday evening, at least 14 members of the same family were killed in an air strike on a displacement camp in the vast western region of Darfur, a rescue group said, blaming the paramilitaries. The Abu Shouk camp ‘was the target of intense bombardment by the Rapid Support Forces on Friday evening’, said the group of volunteer aid workers, which also reported wounded. ‘Fourteen Sudanese, members of the same family, were killed’ and several people wounded, it said in a statement. The camp near El-Fasher, the last state capital in Darfur still out of the RSF’s control, is plagued by famine, according to the United Nations. It is home to tens of thousands of people who fled the violence of successive conflicts in Darfur and the conflict that has been tearing Africa’s third largest country apart since 2023. The RSF has shelled the camp several times in recent weeks. Abu Shouk is located near the Zamzam camp, which the RSF seized in April after a devastating offensive that virtually emptied it. The United Nations says nearly one million people had been sheltering at the site. On Saturday, an RSF strike on a prison in the army-controlled southern city of El-Obeid killed at least 19 people and wounded 45, a medical source said. The source told AFP that the jail in the North Kordofan state capital was hit by an RSF drone. Elsewhere on Saturday, army warplanes struck RSF positions in the Darfur cities of Nyala and El-Geneina, destroying arms depots and military equipment, a military source said. This week, the RSF said it had taken the strategic town of En Nahud in West Kordofan, a key army supply line to Darfur. Sudan’s army-aligned authorities accuse the United Arab Emirates of supplying drones to the RSF, which has no air force of its own. The war—which began as a power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo—has killed tens of thousands, displaced more than 13 million people and triggered what the United Nations calls one of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters. It has effectively divided the country in two with the army controlling the north, east and centre while the RSF and its allies dominate nearly all of Darfur in the west and parts of the south. Both sides have been accused of committing war crimes.

{"title": "New Age | Ethiopia journalists face renewed fear", "body": "Journalists are facing raids and terrorism charges in Ethiopia as the media denounces a renewed ‘climate of fear’ ahead of elections next year. There had been hopes for greater press freedom after prime minister Abiy Ahmed took power in 2018, with exiled journalists encouraged to return. But a brutal war in the Tigray region from 2020 to 2022, and ongoing insurgencies in Amhara and Oromia regions, have led to those freedoms being once again harshly curtailed. Last month, three employees of Addis Standard, an online newspaper published in English, were detained for several hours for unknown reasons following a police raid on their offices. Six laptops and eight phones were seized and have still not been returned. In March, seven journalists from the private Ethiopian Broadcasting Service were arrested in a terrorism investigation after the broadcast of a documentary in which a woman claimed to have been raped by men in military uniform. The woman later retracted her statements and the station apologised, but that was not accepted by the authorities. On April 23, a journalist for The Reporter newspaper, who was investigating the grievances of dismissed former military personnel seeking financial compensation, was arrested. Last month also saw parliament pass an amendment to the press freedom law, putting oversight powers more firmly in the hands of the prime minister’s office rather than the semi-independent media association. ‘The current situation for journalists in Ethiopia is direr than ever,’ said ‘Tesfa’, a journalist who has worked in the east African country for 10 years. Like other journalists interviewed by AFP, he gave a false name for fear of repercussions by the security agencies, describing a widespread ‘climate of fear’. After the raid at Addis Standard, ‘Admasu’, who works for another private media outlet, said he deleted messages on WhatsApp and social media. ‘I realised it was time to think twice before doing anything that might land me in jail for no reason,’ he said. Last Saturday, World Press Freedom Day, 14 diplomatic missions in Ethiopia, including Britain, Belgium and France, issued a statement, deploring the fact that ‘freedom of expression continues to be subject to significant pressure’. Ethiopian authorities did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AFP. Some of the toughest restrictions are around access to Oromia and Amhara, the insurgency-hit regions that are Ethiopia’s most populous with more than 60 million people between them. Millions of children are deprived of schooling and hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by the violence, but reporters are rarely granted access. France-based media watchdog Reporters Without Borders put Ethiopia 145th out of 180 countries in its latest press freedom ranking. It said Abiy, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his temporary rapprochement with neighbouring Eritrea, had opened up the media space for a while. RSF said Ethiopia was ‘more open and pluralistic than under the previous regime, and more than 200 once-banned media outlets are now authorised’. But it said the government was now moving to ‘retake control of the information space’. Sadibou Marong, director of RSF’s sub-Saharan Africa bureau, told AFP the ‘recent attacks on press freedom... are weakening an already precarious situation’, with journalists facing ‘long detentions’ and being forced into self-censorship. Local reporters fear the situation will only get worse. ‘This trend will continue as the elections approach,’ said ‘Yosef’, referring to the vote due by June 2026. Yosef, who works for a foreign media outlet, said he ‘expects further arrests’ and intimidation, with many journalists now thinking of leaving Ethiopia or quitting the profession.

{"title": "New Age | Gunmen kill 23 in Nigeria", "body": "Gunmen killed 23 people in four separate attacks in central Nigeria’s Benue state, a Red Cross official said Sunday, the latest flare-up of unrest in the region. The attacks happened Saturday night in four villages. Clashes between nomadic cattle herders and farmers over land use are common in central Nigeria. ‘Reports from the field have confirmed the killings of at least 23 people from different attacks,’ Red Cross secretary in Benue state Anthony Abah said. Eight people were killed in Ukum, nine in nearby Logo, three each in Guma and Kwande, he said, citing data from the organisation’s field disaster officers. Several others were wounded, he added. A police spokeswoman said she was unaware of the attacks. Cephas Kangeh, a retired general manager with a state electricity company who recently relocated to his home village near one of the affected areas said he had heard of three killings, including a couple ambushed while riding a motorcycle which ‘was taken away by the herdsmen’. Chinese operators are mining gold in the area, he said. ‘The attacks did not take place near the mining sites,’ said Kangeh. ‘However, one is puzzled as to why indigenous people are always attacked, maimed yet there has never been a single case of attack on the Chinese miners who are operating in these areas.’ Some of the latest attacks were staged in areas previously targeted by attacks slightly over a month ago, which left at least 56 dead. With many herders belonging to the Muslim Fulani ethnic group, and many farmers Christian, the attacks in Nigeria’s so-called Middle Belt often take on a religious or ethnic dimension. Two attacks by unidentified gunmen earlier in April in neighbouring Plateau state left more than 100 people dead. Across the wider Middle Belt, including in Benue, land used by farmers and herders is coming under stress from climate change and human expansion, sparking deadly competition for increasingly limited space.

{"title": "New Age | Libya armed group leader among dead in Tripoli clashes", "body": "Overnight clashes in Libya’s capital killed at least six people, an emergency medical service said on Tuesday, with local media reporting that an armed group leader was among the dead. Heavy arms fire and explosions were heard in several areas of Tripoli from 9:00pm (1900 GMT) on Monday as violent clashes between rival armed groups rocked the capital. ‘Six bodies have been retrieved from the sites of clashes around Abu Salim’ in Tripoli, the Emergency Medicine and Support Centre said. Reports said Abdelghani al-Kikli, leader of the Support and Stability Apparatus which controls the southern district of Abu Salim, was killed, with unverified images of his body circulating on social media. The reports said he was shot at a base of the rival 444 Brigade while attending a meeting for mediation. Libya expert Jalel Harchaoui said on social media that Kikli was likely ambushed at the base, citing a relative of the SSA leader. Harchaoui described Kikli as among Tripoli’s ‘most successful armed group leaders’, with an ‘ability to outmanoeuvre prime minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah’. The 444 Brigade, which controls other parts of southern Tripoli, is aligned with Dbeibah. Libya is struggling to recover from years of unrest following the NATO-backed 2011 uprising that led to the overthrow and killing of Muammar Gaddafi. The North African country is currently divided between a UN-recognised government in Tripoli led by Dbeibah and a rival administration in the east, controlled by the Haftar family. Local media said clashes also broke out in the southern suburbs between armed groups from Tripoli and rivals from Misrata, a major port city 200 kilometres east of the capital. Authorities had urged residents to stay indoors before saying several hours later that the fighting had been brought under control. The Tripoli-based government on Tuesday said a ‘military operation’ to restore ‘security and stability’ in the capital had been successful. Dbeibah, in a post on social media platform X, thanked government forces ‘for restoring security and asserting the state’s authority in the capital’. ‘What was accomplished today shows that official institutions are capable of protecting the homeland and preserving the dignity of its citizens,’ Dbeibah said. He hailed the security forces’ actions as ‘a decisive step’ in the fight against ‘irregular’ armed factions. Despite relative calm in recent years, clashes periodically break out between armed groups vying for territory. In August 2023, fighting between two powerful armed groups in Tripoli left 55 dead. Authorities in several parts of the capital said schools would be closed on Tuesday until further notice. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya called for calm. ‘UNSMIL is alarmed by the unfolding security situation in Tripoli, with intense fighting with heavy weaponry in densely populated civilian areas,’ it said on X. It urged ‘all parties to immediately cease fighting’, warning that ‘attacks on civilians and civilian objects may amount to war crimes.’ ‘UNSMIL fully supports the efforts of elders and community leaders to de-escalate the situation.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/264816/libya-armed-group-leader-among-dead-in-tripoli-clashes", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 520}
{"title": "New Age | Fresh gunbattles rock Libya capital after brief lull", "body": "Fresh gunbattles have erupted in the Libyan capital between two powerful armed groups, a security official said Wednesday — just a day after authorities declared the fighting over. Clashes flared between the Radaa force and the 444 Brigade in key areas of Tripoli, including the port, the source said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. The official described the fighting as ‘urban warfare’, with intermittent clashes in residential areas involving light and medium weapons. In other areas, heavy weapons were being used to target rival positions. Libya has struggled to recover from years of unrest since the NATO-backed 2011 uprising that toppled and killed long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. The country remains split between a UN-recognised government in Tripoli, led by prime minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, and a rival administration in the east, controlled by the Haftar family. On Monday night, heavy arms fire and explosions rocked several Tripoli districts, killing at least six people, according to authorities. Reports said Abdelghani al-Kikli, leader of the Support and Stability Apparatus which controls the southern district of Abu Salim, had also been killed at a facility controlled by the 444 Brigade. Fighting now extended in southern and western Tripoli as Radaa and ‘groups supporting it came as reinforcements against the 444 Brigade’, the interior ministry source said. Another source said groups were moving into the capital from neighbouring Zawiya in support of Radaa. The 444 Brigade controls parts of southern Tripoli and is aligned with Dbeibah, whereas Radaa controls parts in the capital’s east and holds several key state facilities. On Tuesday, the Tripoli-based government said the fighting had been brought under control, and Dbeibah announced a string of executive orders including dissolving Radaa. Dbeibah also said authorities were seizing or dissolving some bodies previously run by Tripoli armed groups other than the 444 Brigade. The United Nations mission in Libya said it was ‘deeply alarmed by escalating violence in densely populated neighbourhoods of Tripoli for the second night in a row’. In a statement, it called for ‘an immediate, unconditional ceasefire in all areas, allowing safe corridors for the evacuation of civilians trapped in intense conflict zones’.

{"title": "New Age | Mali dissolves political parties in blow to junta critics", "body": "Mali’s military government on Tuesday dissolved the west African country’s political parties, according to a presidency decree, the latest attempt to clamp down on the opposition since the junta seized power. Opposition parties have feared the move for weeks, banding together into a hundred-party coalition to demonstrate in an rare act of open defiance since back-to-back coups in 2020 and 2021 brought the army to power. Hours after junta chief General Assimi Goita approved the suspension of a political parties charter, a step on the road to dissolution, the authorities announced the dissolution of ‘political parties and political organisations’. Read out on national television, the decree likewise bans ‘all meetings of members of political parties and organisations of a political character’. Yet junta officials working for the Malian state’s political and administrative institutions ‘may pursue their mission without having to identify themselves as representatives of political parties’, the decree added. The latest act of repression comes on the recommendation of a national assembly organised in late April, which was all but boycotted by the opposition. Besides the suspension of the political parties charter approved by Goita earlier on Tuesday, which allowed for the parties’ dissolution, the April assembly also proposed handing the junta chief a five-year renewable presidential term without a vote. Since the coups, a welter of retaliatory measures, legal proceedings and the dissolution of a swathe of associations have considerably weakened the Malian opposition. Citing the risk of disturbances to public order, the junta had already suspended all political party activities on May 7, a ban which drew fire from the opposition and calls for repeal from UN experts. That squeeze on civic space comes against a backdrop of demands by the authorities for the country to unite behind the military, which had originally committed to hand power back to civilians by March 2024 but since reneged on that promise. Since 2012, Mali has been mired in violence carried out by jihadist groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, as well as other criminal organisations. Fearing dissolution, a coalition of roughly 100 parties recently formed to demand an end to junta rule by December 2025, calling for ‘the establishment of a timetable for a rapid return to constitutional order’. In a rare act of protest against the junta, the movement drew several hundred people for a demonstration in the capital Bamako in early May. In an op-ed on Monday, former justice minister Mamadou Ismaila Konate said the junta was attempting ‘to systematically demolish political countervailing powers’ in Mali. However Malian director general of territorial administration Abdou Salam Diepkile disagreed. ‘The repeal of this law does not call into question the existence of political parties,’ Diepkile told public broadcaster ORTM. He said the decision was in line with the desire to ‘stop the proliferation of political parties’ in the country. The junta has suspended French television channel TV5 Monde for a reportage on the May 3 demonstration which the authorities argued ‘lacked a commitment to impartiality’, according to a ruling from Mali’s communications regulator. TV5 Monde has previously fallen foul of the junta, which suspended the channel for three months last year. Other media from former colonial power France, including France 24 and Radio France Internationale, have been banned permanently.

{"title": "New Age | UN says ‘alarmed’ by violence in Libya capital", "body": "The United Nations expressed deep concern Thursday over rising violence in Libya’s capital, warning the clashes risk mass displacement and put civilians in grave danger. The fighting broke out late Monday, with heavy gunfire and explosions rocking several districts and killing at least six people, according to authorities. They declared it over within hours, but clashes flared again on Wednesday in key areas including Tripoli’s only port, in what a security source described as ‘urban warfare’. The guns fell silent on Thursday, but fears of renewed violence linger. The International Organisation for Migration called for an immediate halt to hostilities to protect civilians in line with international law. The UN body said it was ‘alarmed by the recent escalation of violence’, highlighting the ‘severe risk of mass displacement and danger to civilians’. Turkey, a proponent of the Tripoli-based government, said it was evacuating its nationals from the North African country. Libya has remained deeply divided since the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled and killed long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. The country is split between a UN-recognised government in Tripoli, led by prime minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, and a rival administration in the east controlled by the Haftar family. Tripoli was calm again on Thursday after the clashes between a powerful armed group aligned with the Tripoli-based government and rival factions it is trying to dismantle. Schools, the University of Tripoli and the city’s only airport remained closed, AFP reporters said. Most shops also stayed shut, except for a few in outlying areas that said they were encountering shortages. The violence was sparked by the killing of Abdelghani al-Kikli, head of the Support and Stability Apparatus, by the 444 Brigade, a force aligned with Dbeibah. Kikli’s group controlled the southern district of Abu Salim. The second wave of clashes pitted the 444 Brigade against the Radaa force, which controls parts of eastern Tripoli and several key state institutions. No official casualty figures were released, but the Libyan Red Crescent said it had recovered a body from a main street in Tripoli. While the fighting subsided overnight, SSA loyalists said Kikli’s death ‘only strengthens our resolve to relentlessly pursue those involved wherever they are’. His relatives said he was killed in an ‘ambush’ during a mediation meeting at a 444 Brigade facility. Dbeibah on Tuesday vowed to ‘do away with irregular groups’ in Tripoli and ‘establish the principle that there is no place in Libya except for state institutions’. Libya expert Jalel Harchaoui said the clashes amounted to a ‘territorial reshuffle’, though fighting the more popular and entrenched Radaa force proved difficult. More than 500 people rallied on Wednesday night in the Souq el-Joumaa neighbourhood, a Radaa stronghold, chanting against the Dbeibah government before shots were fired to disperse them. The demonstration followed a string of executive orders to dismantle Radaa and dissolve other Tripoli-based armed groups, excluding the 444 Brigade. Radaa enjoys a degree of public legitimacy despite running prisons deemed illegal. The SSA, by contrast, faces mounting accusations of abuse, including torture and forced labour of sub-Saharan African migrants. ‘Whether these clashes serve to undermine or consolidate Dbeibah’s authority remains an open question,’ wrote the International Crisis Group’s Claudia Gazzini. ‘Either way, residents of Tripoli are yet again victims of violence wrought by forces beyond their control.’ The embassies of Germany, France the United States, Britain and Italy on Wednesday evening expressed ‘their deep concern about the recent violence in Tripoli’, urging the ‘authorities to take all measures to protect civilians’ in a statement.

{"title": "New Age | Chad’s ex-PM ‘abducted’ from home", "body": "Chad’s former prime minister Succes Masra, a critic of the ruling authorities of the central African nation, was taken by force from his home early Friday, his party said. ‘Succes Masra was just abducted by military force today, May 16 at 5:56 am’ from his home, which also serves as headquarters for his party, Les Transformateurs (The Transformers), said a post on his official Facebook page. The post also featured an unverified video that showed him leaving his residence surrounded by around a dozen armed men in military uniform. Masra, who served as prime minister of Chad from January to May 2024, faced off against President Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno in presidential elections last May. He took 18.5 per cent of the vote against Deby’s 61.3 per cent, but claimed victory. He has been one of Deby’s fiercest opponents. Deby had been proclaimed transitional president by fellow army generals in 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, who had ruled Chad for 30 years, was killed in a gun battle with rebels. Deby promised an 18-month transition to democracy but extended it by two years. Opposition figures have since fled, been silenced or joined with Deby. After a new constitution was approved in a referendum in December 2023, Deby, 40, was elected president in May 2024 in voting that international observers said was not credible.

{"title": "New Age | Libya’s PM calls on armed groups to align with state", "body": "Libya’s UN-backed premier Saturday called on armed groups to align themselves with ‘state institutions’ after days of deadly clashes in Tripoli and protests demanding his resignation. ‘We will welcome all those who choose to stand with the state,’ said prime minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah in a televised address. ‘We will side-line those who resort to blackmail and corruption. Our goal is a Libya free of militias and corruption.’ Days of clashes in the capital have pitted an armed group aligned with the Tripoli-based government against groups it has been seeking to dismantle. Libya is split between the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, led by Dbeibah, and a rival administration in the east controlled by the family of military strongman Khalifa Haftar. The North African country has remained deeply divided since the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled and killed long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi. The recent fights have killed at least eight people, said the UN, while the authorities have yet to release an official tally. The clashes had been trigerred by the killing of Abdelghani al-Kikli, head of the Support and Stability Apparatus faction, by the Dbeibah-aligned 444 Brigade. A second wave of clashes pitted the 444 Brigade against another group, the Radaa force, which controls parts of eastern Tripoli and several key state institutions. And a string of executive orders had sought to dismantle Radaa and dissolve other Tripoli-based armed groups, excluding the 444 Brigade. Dbeibah’s latest address mainly concerned Radaa, a group controlling parts of eastern Tripoli. ‘Trying to sow discord between us and Souq al-Joumaa (a Radaa stronghold) is bound to fail,’ Dbeibah said, acknowledging ‘a shared mistake’ when speaking of the ‘clashes in the heart of Tripoli in neighbourhoods full of civilians’. He said certain militias ‘had grown excessively, to the point of controlling the entire political, financial, economic, and even social landscape’. He said an SSA associate ‘took control of six banks, and those who dared to oppose him disappeared’, citing abuses by among others Kikli’s nephew, who ‘coldly executed 10 people recently’. Another SSA associate, Ousama Al Masri Nejim, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for acts of torture and the rape of a young girl, Dbeibah noted. ‘For the first time, I can tell you that you can hope to get rid of the militias,’ Dbeibah said, vowing to remove ‘those who prioritise blackmail and corruption’. Yet Tripoli residents have taken to the streets for two consecutive days, demanding Dbeibah’s resignation after the deadly fighting. Some 500 people protested on Saturday after thousands of other anti-government demonstrators had gathered at Martyrs’ Square in central Tripoli on Friday before marching on the premier’s office. The Friday rally had been followed by one police officer being shot dead by unknown attackers when he was ‘targeted while securing’ Dbeibah’s office, according to the government. Tripoli saw signs of normalcy on Friday, with flights resuming, shops reopening and people returning to work. But despite that, the capital’s political situation remained volatile. Local media reported late Friday that six ministers and deputy ministers from Dbeibah’s cabinet had resigned. Only two confirmed their departure. Several municipal councils in western Tripoli voiced support for the protests demanding that Dbeibah quit. Khaled al-Mishri, head of the High Council of State in the capital, said he had begun talks with the eastern-based parliament to ‘choose a national figure to form a new government’. Dbeibah, meanwhile, met tribal elders in the capital on Saturday and said his government was ‘trying to respond quickly’ to the recent developments in the city. In his first statement since the clashes erupted on Monday, he urged the tribal leaders to support ‘the state’s efforts’ to prevent ‘a return to chaos and the rule of armed groups’. He also met a delegation from Misrata, his hometown, some 200 kilometres east of Tripoli. In a statement, the government said the delegation ‘expressed firm and unwavering support’ for his efforts to ‘end the control of armed groups and strengthen state authority’ in Tripoli. While the situation remained uncertain, Turkey — a key proponent of Dbeibah’s government — repatriated 82 of its nationals late Friday.

Explosions rang out in the area, where the RSF had retreated after losing control of the Sudanese capital in March, an AFP correspondent at the scene reported. The army said its operation was aimed at driving the paramilitaries, with which it has been at war since April 2023, from their last positions in Khartoum state. The conflict has pitted the army headed by Sudan’s de facto leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the RSF under his former deputy Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. The conflict has effectively split the country in two, with the army controlling the north, east, and centre, while the RSF dominates nearly all of Darfur and parts of the south. Besides killing tens of thousands of people, the two-year conflict has uprooted 13 million others, more than three million of whom have fled the country as refugees.

{"title": "New Age | South Africans angered by Trump’s ‘genocide’ claims", "body": "South Africans voiced anger on Thursday at US president Donald Trump’s persistent false claim of a genocide against white farmers that were repeated in talks with president Cyril Ramaphosa. The talks between the two presidents Wednesday were aimed at repairing relations that have nosedived since Trump took office in January, since threatening high trade tariffs and expelling the South African ambassador. ‘I am not happy,’ university student Nicole Mbhele said. ‘He made it seem like we want to kill white people or white farmers for our land or wanting it back,’ she said. A video aired during the meeting showed the leader of a fringe, radical opposition party chanting a song from the anti-apartheid struggle about ‘killing’ white farmers. Trump also repeated baseless allegations that South Africa was expropriating land from the minority white Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch settlers who own more than three-quarters of commercial farmland. ‘Donald Trump does not have facts about what is happening in South Africa,’ said 25-year-old saleswoman Naledi Morwalle. He was making ‘false accusations about our country,’ she said. South Africans followed the meeting live on television and many were proud of the performance of the South African delegation, reinforced by four cabinet ministers and two top golfers. While some said Ramaphosa could have been more adamant in rejecting Trump’s baseless claims of a ‘white genocide’, others noted his calm pushback that the black South Africans suffer most from the high crime rate. ‘I think our country did well and actually put the facts out there,’ said activist Ulrich Steenkamp. ‘Whether the world responds is up to them,’ he added. The video played during the meeting, which also showed rows of white crosses in what Trump falsely said were graves of murdered white farmers, clearly rattled Ramaphosa, said analyst Thelela Ngcetane-Vika, of the Wits School of Governance. ‘In the first half of the session President Ramaphosa was very well prepared, poised as a statesman, diplomatic but when that video played you could literally see his voice language change, he became uneasy,’ she said. Ramaphosa should have provided data to disprove Trump’s disinformation, she said. An Afrikaans father, Authur Williams, said the success of the talks would only be seen in any trade deals reached between the two major trading partners. ‘I sincerely hope that economically we will come to an agreement where it’s mutually beneficial and there are economic benefits for both parties,’ he said.

{"title": "New Age | S Sudan clashes kill 75 since February: UN", "body": "Clashes between South Sudan’s army and fighters backing the rival to president Salva Kiir have killed at least 75 civilians since February, the UN human rights chief said on Friday. Dozens more have been injured and thousands forced to flee their homes in the world’s newest state, said United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk. South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011, was plunged into a civil war between 2013 and 2018 that left around 4,00,000 dead and four million displaced. A 2018 power-sharing agreement between the warring parties had allowed for a precarious calm. But for several months, violent clashes have set president Kiir’s faction against supporters of his rival, vice president Riek Machar, who was arrested in March. The fighting between Kiir’s SSPDF, Machar’s SPLA-IO and their respective militias has left ‘at least 75 civilians killed and 78 others injured, and displaced thousands from their homes’, Turk said in a statement. There are reports of ‘indiscriminate aerial bombardments, river and ground offensives’ by the South Sudanese army against SPLA-IO positions in Jonglei State and Upper Nile regions,’ the statement said. ‘Civilian-populated areas have also been struck, including a medical facility operated by (mdical charity) Doctors Without Borders.’ On Wednesday, the SPLA-IO and allied armed groups launched a counter-offensive to recapture areas it had lost in Fangak county in Jonglei State, causing more civilians to flee their homes. According to a UN estimate in mid-April, around 1,25,000 people have been displaced since the escalation of tensions. Turk said dozens of opposition politicians linked to the SPLM-IO had been arrested, including Machar, ministers, MPs and army officers, as had civilians. He expressed concern over arbitrary detentions and a rise in hate speech since February. ‘All parties must urgently pull back from the brink,’ Turk said. ‘I urge all parties to uphold the 2018 peace agreement.’ The escalation of violence risks further worsening the already terrible humanitarian situation and widespread violations of human rights, he said.

{"title": "New Age | AU for permanent ceasefire in Libya", "body": "The African Union called for a permanent ceasefire in Libya on Saturday after deadly clashes in the capital earlier this month and demonstrations demanding the prime minister’s resignation. The latest fighting in the conflict-torn North African country pitted an armed group aligned with the Tripoli-based government against factions it has sought to dismantle, resulting in at least eight dead, according to the United Nations. Despite a lack of a formal ceasefire, the clashes mostly ended last week, with the Libya defence ministry saying this week that efforts towards a truce were ‘ongoing’. On Saturday, the AU’s peace and security council condemned the recent violence, calling for an ‘unconditional and permanent ceasefire’. In a statement on X, the council urged ‘inclusive, Libyan-led reconciliation’, adding that it ‘appeals for no external interference’. Libya is split between the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, led by prime minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, and a rival administration in the east. The country has remained deeply divided since the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled and killed longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi. The clashes were sparked by the killing of an armed faction leader by a group aligned with Dbeibah’s government—the 444 Brigade, which later fought a third group, the Radaa force that controls parts of eastern Tripoli and the city’s airport. It came after Dbeibah announced a string of executive orders seeking to dismantle Radaa and dissolve other Tripoli-based armed groups but excluding the 444 Brigade.

{"title": "New Age | 44 killed in Nigeria attacks", "body": "At least 44 people have been killed in separate attacks in recent days in central Nigeria, a local government official said Tuesday, raising the toll in the latest raids in a region where herders and farmers often clash. The attacks occurred in three villages between Friday and Monday, the chairman of the Gwer West local government area of Benue state, Ormin Torsar Victor, said. Motives for the violence were not clear, but Victor blamed the ‘coordinated attacks’ on Fulani cattle herders. Muslim ethnic Fulani nomadic herders have long clashed with settled farmers, many of whom are Christian, in Benue over access to land and resources. ‘As of today morning I passed through Aondona, they were mentioning 14 bodies that have been recovered, including a pregnant woman and a boy of two,’ he said, adding that 30 others were killed in Ahume. ‘Yesterday evening one person was killed, the number keeps increasing by the day. Even now I think some corpses have not yet been discovered,’ he said, calling the attacks ‘systematic’. The victims were either shot or stabbed, he said. He said the ‘pregnant woman was macheted’ while the two-year-old boy was ‘mutilated’. A Catholic priest was shot and wounded while driving along the Markudi-Naka road, the church and the local government official said. ‘They shot him and left him there thinking he was dead,’ said Victor, adding that two passengers that were with him were abducted. In a call for prayers for the wounded priest posted on Facebook, the church said he was shot by ‘suspected terrorist herdsmen’. A resident of Aondona, Ruthie Dan Sam, said late Monday that ‘20 people were killed here in Aondona’. ‘Children of less than two are being killed. The worst sight is a baby macheted on its mouth,’ she said. She added that other people had been killed in neighbouring villages, but said she had no figures. Victor said he and other locals had buried five people, including a father and two of his sons killed in the village of Tewa Biana ‘very close to a military base’. Benue state police spokesperson Anene Sewuese Catherine confirmed two attacks in the area but said her office had received ‘no report of 20 people’ killed. She said that one raid resulted in the death of a policeman who had ‘repelled an attack’ and that ‘three dead bodies were discovered’. The attacks in Nigeria’s so-called Middle Belt often take on a religious or ethnic dimension. Benue has been one of the states hit hardest by such violence between nomadic herders and farmers who blame herdsmen for destroying farmland with their cattle grazing.

{"title": "New Age | Paramilitaries claim capture of key Sudan towns", "body": "Paramilitary forces fighting Sudan’s military have said they captured two strategic towns in the war-ravaged nation, which has been hit by a cholera outbreak that killed 70 people in the capital this week. For more than two years Africa’s third-largest country has been engulfed by a war between the army, led by the nation’s de facto ruler, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The surge in cholera infections comes weeks after drone strikes blamed on the RSF knocked out water and electricity supplies across the capital Khartoum, which now faces a mounting health emergency. The RSF announced Thursday that its forces had retaken the key towns of Dibeibat, in South Kordofan state, and Al-Khoei, in West Kordofan state, which border South Sudan. ‘The liberation of Dibeibat, followed by Al-Khoei, not only means a field victory; it also consolidates the complete control of the RSF over most of the Kordofan region,’ an RSF spokesman said in a statement. Al-Khoei, located around 100 kilometres from El-Obeid — a crossroads between Khartoum and the Darfur region — had been briefly recaptured by the army this month. Residents confirmed to AFP that Dibeibat, which links the states of North and South Kordofan, was now under RSF control. The conflict has effectively split Sudan in two: the army controls the centre, east and north of the country, while paramilitaries hold almost all of Darfur in the west and parts of the south. The war has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 13 million and created what the United Nations has described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. Last week, the military-backed government said it had dislodged RSF fighters from their last bases in Khartoum state, two months after retaking the heart of the capital from the paramilitaries. Khartoum has been a battleground throughout the war and remains devastated, with health and sanitation infrastructure barely functioning. Up to 90 per cent of hospitals in the conflict’s main battlegrounds have been forced out of service by the fighting. Now the capital is facing a major health crisis. A cholera outbreak claimed 70 lives on Tuesday and Wednesday, the health ministry for Khartoum state said Thursday. Health officials also recorded more than 2,100 new infections over the same two days. But the UN’s humanitarian agency, OCHA, said it is ‘difficult to assess the true scale of the outbreak’ with ‘significant discrepancies’ in official data. The federal health ministry reported 172 deaths in the week to Tuesday, 90 per cent of them in Khartoum state. Authorities said 89 per cent of patients in isolation centres are recovering, but warn that deteriorating environmental conditions are driving a surge in cases. Cholera vaccinations have begun in Jebel Awila, the hardest-hit district in Khartoum, UN chief Antonio Guterres’s spokesman said Thursday. Meanwhile the World Health Organisation had delivered more than 22 metric tons of cholera and emergency health supplies, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. Cholera is endemic to Sudan, but outbreaks have become worse and more frequent since the war broke out. Since August, health authorities have recorded more than 65,000 cases and over 1,700 deaths across 12 of Sudan’s 18 states. ‘Sudan is on the brink of a full-scale public health disaster,’ said Eatizaz Yousif, the International Rescue Committee’s Sudan director. ‘The combination of conflict, displacement, destroyed critical infrastructure and limited access to clean water is fuelling the resurgence of cholera and other deadly diseases.’ Aid agencies warn that without urgent action, the spread of disease is likely to worsen with the arrival of the rainy season next month, which severely limits humanitarian access. Sudan’s government also faces US sanctions over allegations by Washington that the Sudanese military used chemical weapons last year in its war against the RSF. On Thursday, Sudan’s foreign ministry announced the creation of a national committee to investigate the charge, while expressing its ‘disbelief in the validity of the US administration’s accusations’.

{"title": "New Age | Death toll in central Nigeria flood rises to 88", "body": "The death toll in central Nigeria flash floods has risen to at least 88 after rescuers recovered more bodies, an emergency services official said on Friday. Teams of rescuers continued to search for missing residents after torrential rains late on Wednesday washed away dozens of homes in the city of Mokwa, drowning residents with many still missing. ‘The death toll is about 88,’ Hussaini Isah, head of operations for the National Emergency Management Agency in Niger state told journalists, adding that the number is ‘rising’. Earlier, a Niger state emergency management agency spokesman, Ibrahim Audu Husseini, said he ‘expected the toll to rise considerably because there are different rescuers at different locations’. Nigeria’s rainy season, which usually lasts six months, is just getting started for the year. Flooding, usually caused by heavy rains and poor infrastructure, wreaks havoc every year, killing hundreds of people across the west African country. Scientists have also warned that climate change is already fuelling more extreme weather patterns. In Nigeria, the floods are exacerbated by inadequate drainage, the construction of homes on waterways and the dumping of waste in drains and water channels. The Nigerian Meteorological Agency had warned of possible flash floods in 15 of Nigeria’s 36 states, including Niger state, between Wednesday and Friday. In 2024, more than 1,200 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced in at least 31 out of Nigeria’s 36 states, making it one of the country’s worst floods in decades, according to the National Emergency Management Agency.

The sharp jump from the previous death toll of 115 came as bodies were recovered nearly 10 kilometres away from the town of Mokwa, the epicentre of the floods, Ibrahim Audu Husseini, a spokesperson for the Niger state emergency management agency, told AFP. As Husseini warned that the toll could still rise—with bodies being swept away down the powerful Niger River—President Bola Tinubu said that search-and-rescue operations were underway, with the disaster response being aided by security forces. According to the figures shared by Husseini, 151 people were killed, 3,018 were displaced, 265 houses were ‘completely destroyed’ and two bridges were washed away in the busy, rural market town. Tinubu, in an overnight post on social media, added that ‘relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay’ in Mokwa, which was hit by torrential rains late on Wednesday through to early on Thursday. Buildings collapsed and roads were inundated in the town, which is located more than 350 kilometres by road from the capital Abuja, an AFP journalist in Mokwa observed on Friday. Emergency services and residents searched through the rubble as floodwaters flowed alongside. ‘Some bodies were recovered from the debris of collapsed homes,’ Husseini said, adding that his teams would need excavators to retrieve corpses. He said many were still missing, citing a family of 12 where only four members had been accounted for as of Friday. Mohammed Tanko, 29, a civil servant, pointed to a house he grew up in, telling reporters: ‘We lost at least 15 from this house. The property [is] gone. We lost everything.’ The national emergency management agency said that the Nigerian Red Cross, local volunteers, the military and police were all helping in the response.

{"title": "New Age | 4 million flee Sudan since start of war", "body": "More than four million people have fled Sudan since the start of the conflict in 2023, the United Nations said Tuesday, calling the figure a ‘devastating milestone’. UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said that if the war continues, the outflow of people would threaten regional and global stability. Sudan’s regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in a battle for power since April 2023. The war has killed tens of thousands of people and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. ‘Four million people now have fled Sudan into neighbouring countries since the start of the war, now in its third year,’ UNHCR spokeswoman Eujin Byun said at a press briefing in Geneva. ‘It’s a devastating milestone in what is the world’s most damaging displacement crisis,’ he added. ‘If the conflict continues, thousands more people will continue to flee, putting regional and global stability at stake.’ UNHCR figures showed that 40,03,385 people had fled Sudan as refugees, asylum seekers, and returnees as of Monday. Of those, 1.5 million have fled to Egypt; more than 1.1 million to South Sudan, including nearly 8,00,000 returnees who had been refugees themselves in Sudan; and more than 8,50,000 to Chad. The UNHCR described a deepening humanitarian emergency in eastern Chad, where the number of Sudanese refugees has more than tripled since the war broke out. The country was already hosting more than 4,00,000 Sudanese refugees before the conflict began, and the figure has now surpassed 1.2 million. This is placing ‘unsustainable pressure on Chad’s ability to respond’, said Dossou Patrice Ahouansou, UNHCR’s principal situation coordinator in Chad, speaking from Amdjarass in the country’s east. He said there had been an influx across the border since late April following violent attacks in Sudan’s North Darfur region, including assaults on displacement camps. In just over a month, 68,556 refugees have arrived in Chad’s Wadi Fira and Ennedi Est provinces, with an average of 1,400 people crossing the border daily in recent days, he said. ‘These civilians are fleeing in terror, many under fire, navigating armed checkpoints, extortion, and tight restrictions imposed by armed groups,’ Ahouansou said. He said the emergency response was ‘dangerously underfunded’, with people living in ‘dire’ shelter conditions, and tens of thousands exposed to extreme weather, insecurity and water shortages. UNHCR said there was an ‘urgent need’ for the international community ‘to acknowledge, and act to eradicate, the grave human rights abuses being endured in Sudan’. ‘Without a significant increase in funding, life-saving assistance cannot be delivered at the scale and speed required,’ Ahouansou said. The war has effectively split Sudan in two, with the army holding the centre, east and north, while the paramilitaries and their allies control nearly all of Darfur and parts of the south.

{"title": "New Age | 100 killed by gunmen in north-central Nigeria: rights group", "body": "At least 100 people have been killed in a gun attack on a village in Nigeria ‘s north-central Benue state, Amnesty International Nigeria said Saturday. The attack took place between late Friday and the early hours of Saturday in Yelewata, a community in the Guma area of the state, the rights group said in a Facebook post. Dozens of people are still missing, and hundreds were injured and without adequate medical care, it added. ‘Many families were locked up and burnt inside their bedrooms. So many bodies were burnt beyond recognition,’ Amnesty said. Graphic videos and photographs on social media platforms showed what appeared to be corpses and burnt down houses in the aftermath of the attack. Udeme Edet, a spokesperson of the police in Benue, confirmed that an attack took place in Yelewata, but did not specify how many people were killed. While it remains unclear who was responsible for the killings, such attacks are common in Nigeria’s northern region where local herders and farmers often clash over limited access to land and water. The farmers accuse the herders, mostly of Fulani origin, of grazing their livestock on their farms and destroying their produce. The herders insist that the lands are grazing routes that were first backed by law in 1965, five years after the country gained its independence. Last month, gunmen, believed to be herders, killed at least 20 people in the Gwer West area of Benue. In April, at least 40 people were killed in the neighbouring state of Plateau. Benue State Gov. Hyacinth Alia has sent a delegation to Yelewat to support relatives of the victims.

{"title": "New Age | 60 migrants feared dead after Libya shipwrecks", "body": "At least 60 migrants are feared dead after a pair of shipwrecks off the coast of Libya over the past week, according to the International Organisation for Migration. The first ship went down on June 12 near a Libyan port in Tripoli, with 21 people, including women and children, reported missing and only five survivors found, the IOM said in a statement Tuesday. Those lost at sea included Eritrean, Pakistani, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals. The second wreck took place about 35 kilometres off the port city of Tobruk, with the sole survivor reporting 39 people lost at sea, according to the UN body. ‘With dozens feared dead and entire families left in anguish, IOM is once again urging the international community to scale up search and rescue operations and guarantee safe, predictable disembarkation for survivors,’ said Othman Belbeisi, the IOM’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa. According to the statement, at least 743 people have died so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The deadly route, it said, is ‘marked by increasingly dangerous smuggling practices, limited rescue capacity and growing restrictions on humanitarian operations’. As of June 15, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, migrant landings on the Italian coast were up 15 per cent year on year, with most originating in Libya.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan refugees stranded as IOM suspends transport", "body": "The United Nations migration agency warned Friday that critical funding shortfalls have forced it to ‘temporarily suspend’ a vital transport link in South Sudan, stranding people fleeing the war in neighbouring Sudan. South Sudan has been plagued by conflict and poverty since its independence in 2011, heightened in recent months by the roiling war in Sudan on its porous northern border. In Sudan, the conflict between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that began in April 2023 has recently intensified in the west and south. On Friday, the UN International Organisation for Migration warned that funding cuts meant its transport operations for people fleeing south into South Sudan were ‘drastically reduced and temporarily suspended on 1 June 2025’. It said in a statement that it had established an emergency service consisting of one bus and one truck between the Joda border — the main crossing between the two countries — and the town of Renk. However, the IOM said it could only run the service until the end of June, appealing for $6.5 million to plug the funding shortfall. ‘The people arriving in South Sudan have already endured unimaginable trauma — conflict, displacement and profound loss,’ said IOM Director General Amy Pope. She said it was ‘unconscionable’ that many had now been ‘left stranded at the border without the means to reach safety or rebuild their lives’. ‘We cannot allow financial constraints to determine whether people live with dignity or languish in desperation,’ she said. The IOM said the suspension would also strain the host communities, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks and exacerbating tensions over already scarce resources including water, medical care, land, and livelihoods. It comes only days after the IOM said that more than 16,000 people had been displaced in a week by violence in Sudan. The uptick in fighting — both in Sudan and South Sudan — comes after US President Donald Trump’s decision to heavily slash foreign aid, causing havoc in the humanitarian sector.

{"title": "New Age | Suicide blast kills 20 in Nigeria", "body": "A suicide attack in Nigeria’s Borno state by a woman allegedly acting for Boko Haram killed at least 20 anti-jihadist fighters, militia members told AFP on Saturday. Police have confirmed 10 people have been killed and said the overall toll could be higher. Late on Friday, a woman allegedly detonated explosives strapped to her body at a haunt for vigilantes and local hunters assisting the Nigerian military in fighting ‘jihadists’ in the town of Konduga, the militia told AFP. ‘We lost 20 people in the suicide attack which happened yesterday [Friday] at around 9:15pm local time while our members were hanging out near the fish market,’ said Tijjani Ahmed, the head of an anti-jihadist militia in Konduga district. Konduga is about 40 kilometres from Maiduguri, the capital of the northeastern state of Borno. Surrounding villages have been repeatedly targeted by suicide bombers said to be acting for Boko Haram, a group of armed Islamic militants that has been active in the area for at least 16 years. Konduga town itself had seen a lull in such attacks in the past year. ‘Eighteen people died on the spot, while 18 others were injured. Two more died in hospital, raising the death toll to 20,’ Ahmed said. Sixteen were wounded, with 10 of them nursing severe injuries in two hospitals in Maiduguri, he said. The dead were buried in a mass funeral on Saturday, an AFP reporter saw. Corpses wrapped in white cloths—some covered in bamboo mats—were laid out in rows on the ground on wooden biers ahead of the burial. The alleged bomber was dressed as a local heading to the crowded nearby fish market. She detonated her explosives as soon she reached the shed used by the militia fighters as a hangout, said militia member Ibrahim Liman. He gave the same toll as Ahmed. Borno state police spokesperson Nahum Daso told AFP 10 bodies had been recovered from the ‘suicide attack’. He said the toll could be higher as ‘details are sketchy’. Konduga fish market, which is usually busy at night, has been the target of a series of suicide attacks in the past. ‘I was in the market to buy fish for dinner when I heard a loud bang some metres behind me,’ Konduga resident Ahmed Mallum said. ‘I was flung to the ground and I couldn’t stand. I just lay down,’ Mallum said. The conflict between the authorities and Boko Haram has been ongoing for 16 years. In that time, more than 40,000 people have died and around two million been displaced from their homes in the northeast, according to the United Nations. The violence has spread to neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon, prompting a regional military coalition to fight armed militant Islamic groups.

{"title": "New Age | Nigeria receives over 100 looted artifacts from Netherlands", "body": "The Netherlands on Saturday officially handed back to Nigeria 119 precious ancient sculptures, stolen from the former kingdom of Benin more than 120 years ago during the colonial era. It is the latest return of artefacts to Africa, as pressure mounts on Western governments and institutions to hand back the spoils of colonial oppression. Nigeria celebrated the return of the priceless ‘Benin Bronzes’ — metal and ivory sculptures dating back to the 16th to 18th centuries — with a ceremony held at the National Museum in Lagos, showcasing four of them in the museum’s courtyard. The selection included a bronze carving of a king’s head, a carved elephant tusk and a small leopard. In the 19th century, British troops stole thousands of Benin Bronzes in the then-independent kingdom of Benin, in the south of present-day Nigeria. The sculptures were pillaged from the kingdom’s royal palace and have since been held in museums and private collections across Europe and the United States. The four artefacts currently on display in Lagos will remain in the museum’s permanent collection, while the others will be returned to Ewuare II, the Oba of Benin — the traditional ruler of the kingdom of Benin in southern Nigeria. ‘These are embodiments of the spirit and identity of the people from which they were taken from,’ said Olugbile Holloway, director-general of Nigeria’s National Commission for Museums and Monuments. ‘All we ask of the world is to treat us with fairness, dignity and respect,’ he said at the ceremony, where he announced that Germany had agreed to return more than 1,000 additional Benin Bronze pieces. ‘The German government has actually signed a transfer agreement to hand over a 1,000 Benin Bronzes back’ to Nigeria, he said. Nigeria’s art and culture minister Hannatu Musa Musawa, who signed the handover document with the Dutch ambassador for international cultural cooperation, Dewi van de Weerd, said ‘Nigeria needs to reclaim its history and its heritage’. ‘The deal reached with Germany further underscores the growing international commitment to right historical wrongs and foster mutual respect,’ she added. Van de Weerd said the Netherlands said the ‘return of the bronzes which were stolen in 1897 by the British is historic’ and would help to restore ‘dignity’. She said her government was also working with other countries such as Indonesia and Sri Lanka for the restitution of artworks plundered by imperialist nations. Adebimpe Adebambo, a Lagos-based artist who has followed the repatriation of the Benin artefacts over the years, said she had paid ‘top euro to see the works that were stolen from my country’. ‘Im happy that they have come home to us,’ she said at the ceremony.

{"title": "New Age | Nigerian gangs kill 20 soldiers", "body": "Criminal gangs in central Nigeria earlier this week killed at least 20 soldiers in a raid on a military base, security sources told AFP on Wednesday. Armed ‘bandits’, as they’re known in the west African country, stormed a base in Niger state Tuesday, overrunning it after a gun battle with troops stationed to combat criminal gangs and jihadists operating in the region, the sources said. The military put the toll at 17. The state is part of a region in central and northwestern Nigeria that has for years been terrorised by criminal gangs who carry out deadly raids on villages, conduct kidnappings for ransom and burn homes after looting them. In Tuesday’s raid, armed men stormed a base outside the town of Bangi in Mariga district in the early morning. ‘We lost 20 soldiers and several injured in the well-coordinated attack on the base,’ a military officer said. Some attackers were also killed in the raid, the military officer said, without giving a toll. ‘The bandits attacked the camp while others laid ambush on soldiers outside, which resulted in the death of 20 soldiers and several bandits as well,’ another military officer said. According to a situation report from an international aid agency, seen by an AFP reporter, ’the assailants overran the camp after a prolonged exchange of fire’, resulting in the ‘killing of 18 soldiers’. Residents of communities in the area fled for fear of ‘further violence’, the report said. With no ideological leaning, the bandits are primarily motivated by financial gain, but their increasing alliance with jihadists from the northeast has been raising concern among authorities and security analysts. Gangs maintain camps in a huge forest straddling Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna states in the northwest region and Niger state in the country’s central zone, and have carried out mass kidnappings of students from schools in recent years. In a short statement on Wednesday, the Nigerian army confirmed its bases in Niger and neighbouring Kaduna state were attacked, leading to casualties among troops. On Tuesday, ‘forward operating bases’ in Niger and Kaduna states ‘were attacked by bandits in a three-pronged attack’, the army said in the statement. ‘Sadly, some gallant warriors paid the supreme price in the day-long battles while four wounded in action troops are currently receiving treatment for their gunshot wounds,’ the army said. Several alleged attackers were killed in counterattacks by troops with air support, the army said, without giving a toll.

{"title": "New Age | Two killed as Kenyan anniv protests turn violent", "body": "Marches in Kenya to mark a year since massive anti-government demos turned violent on Wednesday, with two killed and running battles between protesters and police, who flooded Nairobi’s streets with tear gas and sealed off government buildings with barbed wire. At least 60 people were killed last year by security forces in weeks of protests over tax rises and the dire economic situation for young Kenyans, peaking when a huge crowd stormed parliament on June 25. Thousands gathered in central Nairobi and other towns on Wednesday, including the families of last year’s victims, for initially peaceful anniversary marches. They soon descended into chaos as scattered groups ripped up flagstones to throw projectiles at security forces and chanted for the resignation of president William Ruto. ‘We are marching against police brutality, against oppression by the government, against high taxation, everything that is going wrong in this country,’ said Anthony, 25, who was also selling flags and did not want to give his full name. Two people were shot and killed in the town of Matuu, around 100 kilometres from the capital, a hospital official said, with local media reporting that police had fired on protesters. At least one police officer and several demonstrators were injured in Nairobi, while a man suspected of being a plain-clothed officer was manhandled by the crowd. Last year, unidentified police were seen shooting protesters. By late afternoon, local media showed huge crowds were still heading down main roads towards the business district, though blocked by police. The government ordered TV and radio stations to halt live coverage of the protests, which gained momentum beyond the capital, including in the port city Mombasa. NetBlocks, a global internet tracker, said social media platform Telegram had been restricted. ‘We are here as the young generation. We want a complete overhaul of the system, the system is rotten, the system is rogue,’ said protester Florence Achala in Nairobi. Anger has flared over police brutality, particularly after a teacher was killed in custody earlier this month. A group of peaceful protesters was attacked last week by a gang of motorbike-riding ‘goons’, as they are known in Kenya, armed with whips and clubs and working in tandem with the police. Western embassies in Kenya, including those of Britain, Germany and the United States, criticised in a joint statement ’the use of hired ‘goons’ to infiltrate or disrupt peaceful gatherings’. The ‘goons’ were not clearly present on Wednesday but police used large amounts of tear gas and water cannons as they attempted to push back groups of protesters. Analyst and lawyer Javas Bigambo said he was worried political groups would exploit the volatile mood to foster violence. ‘There is nothing good to celebrate about the events that happened last year,’ he said. ‘If we were serious about commemorating June 25th, it should be in solemnity, prayer and restraint.’ There is deep resentment against Ruto, who came to power in 2022 promising rapid economic progress. Many are disillusioned by continued stagnation, corruption and high taxes, even after last year’s protests forced Ruto to cancel the unpopular finance bill. His government has been at pains to avoid direct tax rises this year. But the frequent disappearances of government critics — rights groups have counted more than 80 since last year’s protests, with dozens still missing — have led many to accuse Ruto of returning Kenya to the dark days of its dictatorship in the 1980s and 1990s. Ruto has previously promised an end to abductions but was unapologetic in a speech on Tuesday, vowing to ‘stand by’ the police.

The marches had been called to mark one year since the anti-tax demonstrations that left at least 60 people dead and peaked when a huge crowd stormed parliament. Although the anniversary marches began peacefully Wednesday, they descended into chaos as young men held running battles with security forces, lit fires and ripped up flagstones to throw at police. Business owners in downtown Nairobi said that looting had started in the afternoon after the government ordered TV and radio stations to stop broadcasting live images of the protests. AFP saw stores that had sold everything from electronics to perfume to clothing reduced to ashes or ransacked by looters. Amnesty International’s Kenya director Irungu Houghton said the death toll had risen to 16. A coalition of rights groups had earlier said at least 400 people were injured, with 83 in serious condition in hospital. They recorded protests in 23 counties around Kenya. Emergency responders reported multiple gunshot wounds, and there were unconfirmed reports in local media that police had opened fire on protesters, particularly in towns outside the capital.

Just over 5,300 students were sitting the second day of the baccalaureat exams at the time of the explosion early Wednesday afternoon in Bangui, the capital of the deeply poor nation. In the ensuing panic, supervisors and students tried to flee, some jumping from the first floor of the school. The injured were transported by ambulance, on the back of pickup trucks or by motorbike taxi, AFP journalists saw. ‘I would like to express my solidarity and compassion to the parents of the deceased candidates, to the educational staff, to the students,’ president Faustin Archange Touadera said in a video published on his party’s Facebook page. Touadera, who is attending a summit of the Gavi vaccine alliance in Brussels, also announced three days of national mourning. According to a document circulating on social media and authenticated by the health ministry, 29 deaths were registered by hospitals in the city. ‘The hospital was overwhelmed by people to the point of obstructing caregivers and ambulances, a health ministry source stated. UN peacekeepers, police and other security were seen around the Barthelemy Boganda high school and hospitals. Education minister Aurelien-Simplice Kongbelet-Zingas said in a statement Wednesday that ‘measures will be taken quickly to shed light on the circumstances of this incident’. The minister added that a further statement would follow regarding selection of a date for the students to resume their exams programme. The Republican Bloc for the Defence of the Constitution, a coalition of opposition parties, condemned what it termed ‘the irresponsibility of the authorities in place, who have failed in their duty to ensure the safety of students and school infrastructure.’ The CAR is among the poorest countries in the world and, since independence from France in 1960, has endured a succession of coups, authoritarian rulers and civil wars. The latest civil war started more than a decade ago. The government has secured the main cities and violence has subsided in recent years. But fighting occasionally erupts in remote regions between rebels and the national army, which is backed by Wagner mercenaries and Rwandan troops. Municipal, legislative, and presidential elections are scheduled for August and December of this year but UN experts are calling for urgent institutional reform of the electoral authority before the polls and for ‘transparent internal governance,’ as tensions between the government and the opposition intensify.

{"title": "New Age | 19 dead in Kenya protests", "body": "The death toll from protests in Kenya to mark the anniversary of a massive crackdown on anti-tax demonstrations has risen to 19, with another 15 people missing, the national human-rights commission said Friday. Wednesday’s anniversary protests drew thousands of people into the streets across Kenya, descending into chaos when young men battled police and destroyed thousands of businesses. ‘The Commission strongly condemns all human rights violations and urges accountability from all responsible parties,’ the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights said in a statement. It said it had so far documented 19 fatalities in Wednesday’s violence and 15 ‘enforced disappearances’. That was an increase from a previous death toll of 16. KNCHR, a government agency, said 531 people had been wounded and 179 arrested. Human Rights Watch called for authorities to be held accountable for the abuses witnessed. ‘Kenyan authorities should not treat protesters as criminals,’ said Otsieno Namwaya, associate Africa director at the rights group. The United Nations deplored the violence and called for calm and restraint. The Kenyan government meanwhile condemned the vandalism and looting of a national fertiliser depot during the protests. The ministry of agriculture said more than 7,354 bags of fertiliser, worth around $230,000, were looted in Meru, about 200 kilometres east of Nairobi. ‘Fertiliser was looted, fertiliser meant to sustain farmers through this planting season,’ the ministry said, calling it ‘a direct assault on Kenya’s food security’. ‘Its loss threatens to trigger a catastrophic crisis for both food crop and cash crop production.’ Agriculture accounts for about 21 per cent of Kenya’s economy. Agriculture minister Mutahi Kagwe called for the arrest and prosecution of those responsible.

{"title": "New Age | Serbian police dismantle anti-govt protesters’ barricades", "body": "Serbian police said on Monday they had cleared barricades that anti-government protesters had set up at the weekend, after clashes between officers and demonstrators demanding early elections. Thousands of people blocked major roads in Belgrade and other Serbian cities late on Sunday to protest at police handling of a mass anti-government demonstration on Saturday. The events were the latest in six months of near daily student-led protests over the collapse of a train station roof that killed 16 people. The disaster in Novi Sad in November, which followed extensive renovation work at the station, was widely blamed on poor construction and entrenched corruption. Around 1,40,000 people rallied in Belgrade on Saturday, in one of the largest demonstration in recent months. Clashes ensued, with riot police using tear gas and batons to disperse a crowd throwing bottles and flares. ‘Several people were detained for attacking and insulting police officers and for disturbing public order,’ police said, without specifying how many people had been arrested. They insisted officers had ‘acted professionally’. In response, thousands of people barricaded major roads in Belgrade and other Serbian cities. Students who are blockading Belgrade universities shared videos on social media apparently showing arrests at some of the barricades. ‘During the night, police removed all roadblocks on routes in Belgrade and traffic can now operate normally,’ police said early on Monday. AFP journalists on the ground confirmed the barricades had been dismantled. Protestors have called on social media for new, local gatherings and blockades later on Monday. The public uproar over the Novi Sad disaster triggered the resignation of the prime minister and the collapse of the government. But a new government was formed through a reshuffle and President Aleksandar Vucic has dismissed calls for elections. He has accused ‘foreign powers’ of orchestrating the protests. For more than half a year, students have demanded a transparent investigation into the deaths in Novi Sad. With little action from authorities, their focus shifted last month to calling for early parliamentary elections. The next parliamentary elections are not expected before 2027.

{"title": "New Age | Anxious residents re-emerge after Mali jihadist attacks", "body": "People in towns in western Mali where jihadists attacked army sites a day earlier were afraid but went about their business Wednesday following the major assault which killed a civilian. Jihadist fighters staged early-morning strikes on military positions in seven towns or cities Tuesday, in the third large-scale attack on the Malian army in a month. A source in the governor’s office in the city of Kayes said the places hit — Kayes, Nioro du Sahel, Niono, Molodo, Sandare, Gogui and Diboli — were calm on Wednesday. ‘The governor’s residence was attacked by the jihadists. There was some damage but today the city is calm,’ the source said. ‘The situation is calm in the other towns but according to the information coming back, the people are afraid,’ the source added. A hospital source in Kayes, the main city in the western region, said a civilian, who had been admitted to hospital following the attacks, had died. ‘More than 10 seriously injured people are admitted here and are receiving treatment,’ the source said, adding most were civilians and one a soldier. In Nioro du Sahel, ‘calm returned on Wednesday morning’, a shop owner who had opened for business said. ‘Yesterday we were really afraid... This morning, people are going about their business, but everyone is talking about nothing but this attack.’ A regional elected official also said the situation was ‘calm everywhere’, but added: ‘The jihadists caused damage’ in several places. An al-Qaeda-linked group known by its Arabic initials, JNIM, claimed responsibility. AFP was unable to independently verify the claim. The series of assaults came on the heels of two major attacks claimed by jihadists. On June 2, a coordinated assault targeted an army camp in the ancient city of Timbuktu in Mali’s north, as well as its airport. That attack took place a day after a bloody raid killed at least 30 soldiers in the centre of the country. Mali’s army said late Tuesday the jihadists had suffered ‘big losses’ and that ‘more than 80 terrorists’ were ‘neutralised’, a loose term that could mean killed or captured. An overnight curfew was imposed for 30 days and people and transport face restrictions in the Kayes region. ‘In Kayes, the city is calm and tense at the same time,’ a resident told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity due to security concerns. People had already hunkered down at home late Tuesday even before the curfew was announced, the resident said. ‘All we could hear were the patrols moving around the city. This morning, insecurity is certainly at the centre of everyone’s discussions, but people are going about their business,’ the resident added. Since 2012, Mali has been battling an Islamist insurgency that erupted in the north of the vast nation, swept the country and spilled over into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger. Violence by groups affiliated to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group as well as separatist movements and criminal gangs has plunged the junta-led west African country into a deep security crisis. The three Sahel states’ military juntas pledged during the coups that brought them to power to make security a priority. But they are struggling to contain the advance by the jihadists, who have recently intensified their offensives against the armies in the three countries.

The men were seized Tuesday when ‘a group of armed assailants carried out a coordinated attack at the factory premises’ of the Diamond Cement Factory in Kayes, the main city in Mali’s western region, the ministry said in a statement late Wednesday. It said the gunmen ‘forcibly took three Indian nationals as hostages’. It added the Indian embassy in Bamako was in ‘close and constant communication’ with Mali’s government, as well as ‘the family members of the abducted Indian nationals’. India did not give details about the attackers, or say if it was in contact with them. However, it said that ‘many military and government installations at multiple locations of western and central Mali were attacked by terrorists on 01 July 2025’. Since 2012, Mali has been battling an Islamist insurgency that erupted in the north, swept the country and spilled over into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.

{"title": "New Age | Nairobi tense as Kenya marks democracy uprising", "body": "Kenya marked its fight for democracy on Monday, with police blocking main roads in Nairobi ahead of potential protests, after last month’s demonstrations descended into violent clashes. Saba Saba Day marks the uprising on July 7, 1990 when Kenyans demanded a return to multi-party democracy after years of autocratic rule by then-president Daniel arap Moi. This year’s event comes as young Kenyans—frustrated over economic stagnation, corruption and repeated acts of police brutality—are once again engaging in protests that have degenerated into looting and violence, leaving dozens dead and thousands of businesses destroyed. Protesters accuse the authorities of paying armed vandals to discredit their movement, while the government has compared the demos to an ‘attempted coup’. On Monday, the streets of Nairobi were eerily quiet after police mounted roadblocks on the main roads, preventing most people from entering the centre, with many businesses closed for the day. Leading activist Hanifa Aden wrote on X: ‘the police getting rained on as they block every road while we stay at home warming our beds.’ ‘Total shutdown and forced holiday executed by the state,’ she said. On Sunday afternoon, a press conference by the Kenyan Human Rights Commission calling for an end to ‘enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings’ was broken up when men, some armed with sticks, forced their way into the compound. Social media and rising economic expectations have created anger at inequalities in a country where around 80 per cent are trapped in informal, poorly paid jobs. But the violent response of the police—at least 80 people have died in protests since June 2024 and dozens detained illegally—has scared many off the streets. Politically, President William Ruto—elected in 2022 – still holds a strong position having forged an alliance with the main opposition leader Raila Odinga, leaving no clear challenger ahead of the next vote in 2027. But each violent crackdown is fuelling further unrest, said activist Nerima Wako. ‘Every time people organise a protest, they kill more people, so it just continues to feed off itself,’ she said. It is as though the government is recycling tactics from the 1990s, said Gabrielle Lynch, an African politics expert at Britain’s University of Warwick. ‘But we’re not in the nineties,’ she said. ‘They don’t seem to have realised the world is different.

{"title": "New Age | UN troubled by Kenya protest killings", "body": "The United Nations on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the deaths of at least 10 people in Kenya where police and protesters clashed during anti-government demonstrations the previous day. The violence erupted on Saba Saba Day, meaning Seven Seven, when demonstrators annually mark the events of July 7, 1990 when Kenyans rose up to demand a return to multi-party democracy after years of autocratic rule by then-president Daniel arap Moi. ‘We are deeply troubled by the killings yesterday of at least 10 people, as well as looting and destruction of property in Kenya,’ UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva. She said that ‘lethal ammunition, rubber bullets, teargas and water cannons were used’ as police responded to the protests. She highlighted that Kenyan police had reported that at least 11 people were killed, 52 police officers injured and 567 arrests made. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights meanwhile reported at least 10 deaths, 29 injuries, 37 arrests and two abductions, she added. ‘We have also received reports of looting and damage to public and private property by unidentified individuals in multiple locations.’ Shamdasani said the violence came ‘barely two weeks after 15 protesters were reportedly killed and many more injured in Nairobi and other parts of Kenya on 25 June’. UN rights chief Volker Turk renews ‘his call for calm and restrain, and full respect for the freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly’, she said. ‘It is essential that legitimate grievances at the root of these protests are addressed,’ the spokeswoman said. The UN rights office noted that Kenyan police had announced an investigation into earlier incidents. Shamdasani stressed that ‘under international human rights law, intentional lethal force by law enforcement officers, including with firearms, should only be used when strictly necessary to protect life from an imminent threat’. Turk reiterates ‘his call for all reported killings and other alleged violations and abuses of international human rights law, including with respect to use of force, to be promptly, thoroughly, independently and transparently investigated’, she said. ‘Those responsible must be held to account.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/269480/un-troubled-by-kenya-protest-killings", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 377}
{"title": "New Age | South Sudan says US deportees under govt care", "body": "War-torn South Sudan has said it is looking after a group of eight criminal migrants controversially deported from the United States. Only one of them is from South Sudan. The administration of US president Donald Trump is trying to move unwanted migrants to third countries as some nations refuse to accept returnees. The rest comprise two people from Myanmar, two from Cuba, and one each from Vietnam, Laos and Mexico. The decision has been fought in American courts. ‘They are currently in Juba under the care of the relevant authorities, who are screening them and ensuring their safety and well-being,’ the South Sudanese foreign ministry statement said late Tuesday. It did not give details, but said the ‘careful and well-studied decision’ was part of ‘on-going bilateral engagement’. ‘South Sudan responded positively to a request from the US authorities as a gesture of goodwill, humanitarian cooperation, and commitment to mutual interests,’ it added. United Nations experts, appointed by the UN Human Rights Council but who do not speak on behalf of the UN, have criticised the move. ‘International law is clear that no one shall be sent anywhere where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, enforced disappearance or arbitrary deprivation of life,’ 11 independent UN rights experts said in a statement. The deportees left the United States for South Sudan in May but their flight ended up in Djibouti when a US district court imposed a stay on third-country deportations. That ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court earlier this month. The group arrived in South Sudan on June 5 with an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, saying they had been returned by US Marines. Foreign ministry spokesperson Apuk Ayuel Mayen said Juba maintains a strong commitment to its people, including ‘its nationals returning under any circumstances’ and ‘persons with recognised links to South Sudan’. Simmering rivalry between South Sudanese president Salva Kiir and his vice-president Riek Machar boiled over into open hostilities in March. The tensions have raised fears of a return to full-scale war in the world’s youngest country, where a civil war killed some 4,00,000 people in 2013-2018.

{"title": "New Age | Kenya’s president warns against bid to ‘overthrow’ govt by protests", "body": "Kenyan president William Ruto warned Wednesday against attempts to ‘overthrow’ the government through ‘unconstitutional means’ and ordered police to shoot violent protesters in the leg, days after 31 people were killed in nationwide anti-government demonstrations. His toughest remarks yet come as the east African nation faces a wave of violent protests over economic stagnation, corruption and police brutality. ‘They want to start chaos, organise protests, burn people’s property, bring disaster so as to overthrow the government before 2027. This is a democratic country,’ Ruto told supporters in the capital Nairobi, speaking in Swahili. ‘This country will not be destroyed by a few people who are impatient and want a change of government through unconstitutional means,’ he said. ‘You cannot sponsor violence and go scot-free,’ he added, saying any attacks on the police would be seen as a ‘declaration of war’. Ruto, who was elected in 2022, also said violent protesters ‘should be shot in the leg, be taken to hospital and taken to court’. The demonstrations began in June last year as a youth-led anti-taxation protest, which subsequently forced the government to withdraw the contested finance bill. But many of Kenya’s youth are once again engaging in protests, which last month degenerated into looting and violence, killing dozens and destroying thousands of businesses. They are disillusioned by the economic situation, corruption and high taxes, as well as police brutality after a teacher died in custody last month. Fifty-one people have died in protests over the last two months, according to an AFP tally citing rights groups. Rallies early this week saw hundreds arrested and scores wounded. Rights groups said 31 people died across the country in the protests which marked Saba Saba day — meaning Seven Seven — or July 7, 1990 when Kenyans rose up to demand a return to multi-party democracy after years of autocratic rule by then-president Daniel arap Moi. Protesters accuse the authorities of paying armed vandals to discredit their movement, while the government compared a demonstration in June to an ‘attempted coup’. Opposition leaders, including Ruto’s former deputy and ally Rigathi Gachagua, have accused the government of unleashing state-sponsored violence against its citizens, slamming it as ‘hostile’. On Tuesday, they called on the public to ‘boycott all businesses, services and institutions owned, operated or publicly linked to this regime and its enablers’. Gachagua campaigned for Ruto during the 2022 election but the two fell out last year, leading to his impeachment. Ruto’s allies have accused Gachagua of bankrolling violent protests, with some calling for his arrest. He has denied the accusations. Marches last month marked the one-year anniversary of the anti-tax protests that saw young demonstrators breach parliament on June 25, with rights groups saying at least 60 people died in last year’s rallies. Social media and rising economic expectations have fanned anger over inequalities in a country where around 80 per cent are trapped in informal, poorly paid jobs. The United Nations said it was ‘deeply troubled’ over the deaths during this week’s protests and that ‘intentional lethal force by law enforcement officers, including with firearms, should only be used when strictly necessary to protect life from an imminent threat’.

{"title": "New Age | Mali junta chief approves law giving him unlimited mandate", "body": "Mali’s junta chief has granted himself a five-year presidential mandate, renewable ‘as many times as necessary’ and without election, in a law made public Thursday. General Assimi Goita’s approval of the measure had been widely expected for several days, and comes after the country’s military-appointed legislative body passed the bill last week. The law, which was leaked to the public after being signed by Goita Tuesday, allows him to lead the west African country until at least 2030, despite the military government’s initial pledge to return to civilian rule in March 2024. It is the latest in a series of restrictions on freedoms by Mali’s military leadership to consolidate its power in the jihadist-hit Sahelian nation. The country’s cabinet, the Council of Ministers, had already adopted the measure last month. Under the law Goita will be able to serve ‘as head of state for a term of five years, renewable as many times as necessary, until the country is pacified’. When Goita took power, he insisted on Mali’s commitment to the fight against jihadist violence and initially pledged a return to civilian rule. He was even celebrated in some quarters as a hero who might bring salvation to his troubled west African nation. But he ultimately failed to make good on his promise to cede power to elected civilians, which was to occur by March 2024. Earlier this year, a junta-led national consultation recommended proclaiming Goita president without a vote for the five-year renewable term. The same assembly — boycotted by most political groups — also recommended the dissolution of political parties and tougher rules for their creation. Subsequently, the junta announced in May the dissolution of all political parties and organisations, as well as a ban on meetings. The on-going squeeze on Mali’s civic space comes against a backdrop of clamour by authorities for the country to unite behind the military. Goita’s rule has marked a turning point in Mali’s relationship with the West. The country has broken ties with France and other former allies and pivoted toward Russia. Mali and its junta-led neighbours Burkina Faso and Niger have teamed up to create their own confederation, the Alliance of Sahel States, and have announced the creation of a joint 5,000-strong force for joint military operations. Meanwhile its Russian mercenary allies from the Africa Corps, tasked in particular with tracking down jihadists, are regularly accused of rights violations against civilians alongside the Malian army. Since 2012, Mali has been mired in violence carried out by jihadist groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, as well as other criminal organisations. Those attacks have only intensified in recent weeks. Despite Mali’s multifaceted tumult, Goita remains popular with a segment of the population, which views him as an architect of reform and newfound sovereignty.

{"title": "New Age | Cameroon president will seek eighth term", "body": "Cameroon’s president Paul Biya said Sunday that he would be seeking an eighth term in office in October’s elections in a bid to extend his nearly 43 years in power. Biya, 92, posted the announcement on X in French and English. ‘I am a candidate for the 12 October 2025 presidential election. Rest assured that my determination to serve you is commensurate with the serious challenges facing us,’ he wrote. ‘Together, there are no challenges we cannot meet. The best is still to come.’ Biya was already the de facto candidate of the Cameroon People’s Democratic Movement, of which he is party leader. But given his age, the president’s health and his capacity to govern have become the subject of debate. Several longstanding supporters have appeared to distance themselves from him in recent months, and there have been two high-profile defections from Biya’s camp in recent weeks. Employment minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary resigned from government in June to stand in the election for his Front for the National Salvation of Cameroon. And former prime minister Bello Bouba Maigari, an ally of Biya’s for nearly 30 years, said he was standing for National Union for Democracy and Progress. Both Tchiroma’s and Maigari’s parties were longstanding allies of Biya’s CPDM, which has held power since independence in 1960. Also in the running are Maurice Kamto, who came second in the 2018 presidential election and is Biya’s fiercest critic, and prominent opposition figure Cabral Libii from the Cameroonian Party for National Reconciliation. Candidates have until July 21 to declare that they intend to run for office. But the opposition is deeply divided and is struggling to unite behind a single candidate, even though public opinion is critical of the government. Cameroonians frequently complain about rampant youth unemployment, rising prices and poor public services. In addition, violence occasionally erupts from separatists, especially in English-speaking regions of the mostly francophone country.

{"title": "New Age | Paramilitary attack kills 48 in central Sudan village", "body": "Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces killed 48 civilians in an attack on a village in the centre of the war-torn country, a monitoring group reported Monday. The Emergency Lawyers, a group that has documented atrocities throughout the two-year conflict between the regular army and the RSF, said civilians were killed en masse Sunday when paramilitary fighters stormed the village of Um Garfa in North Kordofan state, razing houses and looting property. The attack occurred around 90 kilometres north of Bara, a city currently under RSF control, where fierce clashes have recently broken out between the paramilitary force and the army. The village also lies on a key highway to Khartoum, some 250 kilometres southwest of the capital, which the army recaptured in March, sending the RSF on a scramble to secure territory in other parts of the country. A list sent to AFP by the group confirmed that women and children were among those killed in the attack. There are also reports of dozens of civilian casualties in neighbouring villages. The UN’s International Organisation for Migration said on Sunday that intensified fighting in the region forced more than 3,000 people to flee the villages of Shag Alnom and Al Kordi. Many have sought refuge in surrounding parts of Bara, according to the UN agency. The Sudanese army has launched several offensives in recent weeks to regain control of Bara, a key strategic location in North Kordofan. Now in its third year, the conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions, creating what the United Nations describes as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis.

{"title": "New Age | Gunmen kill 27 in central Nigeria", "body": "Gunmen killed 27 people in north-central Nigeria’s Plateau state, in the latest bout of violence in the restive region, local sources said on Tuesday. Plateau state, like other parts of Nigeria’s Middle Belt region, has long suffered deadly farmer-herder clashes over land and natural resources, as well as violence meted out by gangs of armed criminals known as ‘bandits’. Resident Haggai Gankis said that the attackers went into the settlement of Jebu-Rahoss, in the Riyom local government area, on Monday evening, armed with guns and machetes. He blamed the attack on herdsmen. Another resident, Chuwang David, blamed bandits. ‘We were asleep overnight, we heard gunshots, the attackers shot many many people and they also used machetes,’ David said. Da Chomo Moses, another resident, gave the same toll and said he lost three family members ‘for no reason’. ‘Twenty-seven innocent people were shot dead,’ said Gankis, adding that most of the victims were women. Local government council chairman Sati Bature Shuwa confirmed the attack to AFP, but did not give a toll. Residents said an unknown number of people were sent to the hospital. For years, heavily armed bandit gangs have intensified their assaults in rural areas in northwest and central Nigeria. At the same time, Plateau state has been riven by conflicts between herders and farmers over dwindling land and grazing space, exacerbated by population growth and climate change. In the ethnically and religiously mixed state, farmers are mostly Christian while herders are ethnic Fulani Muslims, giving the clashes a sectarian dimension. Land grabs, political and economic tensions between locals and those considered outsiders have heightened divisions in recent decades, as has an influx of hardline Muslim and Christian preachers. A spate of particularly deadly attacks on farmers this year has residents warning the assaults are becoming increasingly frequent, better planned and more organised. Attacks across Plateau and neighbouring Benue state left more than 150 people dead in April alone. While high-profile killings blamed on herders have shocked the country, herders across the region say they are also the victims of deadly attacks, land grabs and cattle poisonings by farmers. Much of the violence in Plateau occurs in areas with little police or government presence, giving criminals a sense of impunity as killings almost always go unsolved, researchers say. Reprisals are often disproportionate and fall across communal lines.

{"title": "New Age | Hundreds rally against government corruption in Liberia", "body": "Hundreds of Liberians took to the streets on Thursday, angry over perceived corruption in president Joseph Boakai’s government and democratic backsliding in the west African country, an AFP journalist saw. Under the pounding rain the protesters marched towards Capitol Hill and other government institutions, chanting ‘Enough is enough’ and brandishing placards taking aim at the head of state. Critics accuse Boakai, who took office at the beginning of 2024 for a six-year term, of mismanaging the impoverished country’s economy, presiding over rampant corruption and failing to improve salaries for public workers. The government’s defenders say it has suspended senior officials for alleged corruption and strengthened ties with investors. The protesters also accuse Boakai of not keeping the promises he made while campaigning to unseat his predecessor, former Ballon D’Or-winning footballer George Weah. One protester, 55-year-old civil servant Bendu Camara, accused the president of targeting officials associated with the Weah administration, and said he was forced into retirement when Boakai came into office. Camara also claimed Boakai’s government gave preferential treatment while distributing jobs and favoured members of his Unity Party. ‘He entered the mansion and we gave him the flag for all Liberians, but he is picking and choosing. He is taking the Unity Party people to be the country’s owners.’ Another protester, Hawa Kpehe, said the president had ‘lied to the Liberian people’. Boakai ‘came to power and took food from our parents’ table. Today, we, their children, are on the streets hustling for ourselves,’ the 22-year-old pottery trader added. Among the world’s poorest countries, Liberia has been hoping to rebuild after a devastating Ebola epidemic in 2014 and years of bloody conflict. Two back-to-back wars devastated the nation from 1989 until 2003, claiming around 2,50,000 lives with rampant massacres, mutilation, rape and the widespread use of child soldiers.

{"title": "New Age | ‘Bandit’ gang kills 9 Nigerian farmers", "body": "A criminal gang killed nine farmers on Friday in Nigeria’s Zamfara state, the epicentre of the country’s violent cattle rustling and kidnapping crisis, an official and two residents said. Motorcycle-riding ‘bandits’—as the gang members are locally known—rounded up a group of farmers working their fields outside Jangebe village in Talata Mafara district, kidnapping around 15 others, the sources said. Armed gangs across Nigeria have taken root across its rural hinterlands amid poverty and government neglect. They raid, loot, burn villages, exact taxes, and conduct kidnappings for ransom. ‘Bandits attacked the farmers and killed nine of them,’ Yahaya Yari Abubakar, political administrator of Talata Mafara district, told AFP. ‘The attackers kidnapped around 15 other farmers, and they are yet to make contact,’ said Abubakar, who attended the funeral of the nine who were killed. The victims included the head of the village’s vigilante self-defence group and his five comrades, along with three residents, said Abu Zaki, a Jangebe resident. ‘Everybody is now afraid of going to the farm for fear of being attacked,’ said another resident, Bello Ahmadu, who gave the same toll. The village was the scene in 2021 of the mass abduction of more than 300 girls from a boarding school. The girls were freed days later after authorities made a ransom payment. Nigeria’s bandits maintain camps in a huge forest straddling Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states, in unrest that evolved from clashes between herders and farmers over land and resources into a broader conflict fuelled by arms trafficking. Increasing cooperation between the criminal gangs, who are primarily motivated by financial gains, and jihadists—who are waging a separate, 16-year-old-armed insurrection in the northeast—has compounded the situation and seen attacks worsen. Zamfara’s state government has recruited vigilantes and anti-jihadist militias to assist the military in fighting the gangs. Last month, vigilantes, with the aid of Nigeria’s secret police, killed around 100 bandits when they raided the enclave of a bandit kingpin in the state’s Shinkafi district, according officials.

{"title": "New Age | DR Congo, M23 armed group sign ceasefire deal", "body": "The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda-backed armed group M23 signed a ceasefire deal on Saturday to end fighting that has devastated the country’s mineral-rich but conflict-torn east. The two sides signed a declaration of principles whose terms include a ‘permanent ceasefire’, after three months of talks in Qatar. It follows a separate peace deal between the Congolese and Rwandan governments signed in Washington last month. Rich in natural resources, especially lucrative minerals, eastern DRC has been wracked by conflict for more than three decades, creating a humanitarian crisis and forcing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. Thousands were killed in a lightning offensive by the M23 in January and February, in which the group seized vast swathes of territory, including the key provincial capitals of Goma and Bukavu. In the agreement signed in Doha, the warring parties agreed to ‘uphold their commitment to a permanent ceasefire’, including refraining from ‘hate propaganda’ and ‘any attempt to seize by force new positions’. The deal includes a roadmap for restoring state authority in eastern DRC, and an agreement for the two sides to open direct negotiations toward a comprehensive peace agreement. Congolese presidential envoy Sumbu Sita Mambu and M23 permanent secretary Benjamin Mbonimpa shook hands after signing the deal at a ceremony in the Qatari capital. The M23 had insisted on seeking its own ceasefire deal with Kinshasa, saying the DRC-Rwanda deal signed in Washington in June left out various ‘problems’ that still needed to be addressed. The two sides said the new deal aligned with the Washington agreement, which US president Donald Trump at the time called the start of ‘a new chapter of hope and opportunity’ for the region. The African Union hailed the new agreement as a ‘significant development’, saying: ‘This... marks a major milestone in the ongoing efforts to achieve lasting peace, security, and stability in eastern DRC and the wider Great Lakes region.’ Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said the deal took account of the DRC’s ‘red lines’, including ‘the non-negotiable withdrawal of the M23 from occupied areas followed by the deployment of our institutions’, including the armed forces. He said the comprehensive peace agreement would follow ‘in the coming days’. The two sides agreed to implement the deal’s terms by July 29 at the latest, and to start negotiations toward a comprehensive agreement by August 8. Rwandan president Paul Kagame and Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi are due to meet in the coming months to solidify the Washington peace deal, whose terms have not yet been implemented. Questions remain over an expected side deal on economic issues, after Trump boasted of securing mineral wealth in the vast central African nation. Tshisekedi said in April he had discussed a deal for access to the DRC’s mineral wealth with US special envoy Massad Boulos. Boulos, who was at the signing ceremony in Doha, called the restoration of the Congolese government’s control over its eastern territory ‘one of the most important clauses’ in the new deal. But ‘we know that there are no magic solutions’ to end the conflict, ‘especially regarding the timeline’, he told a news conference. Previous ceasefire agreements for eastern DRC have collapsed in the past. Neighbouring Rwanda denies providing military backing to the M23, but UN experts say the Rwandan army played a ‘critical’ role in the group’s offensive, including combat operations. The front line has stabilised since February, but fighting was still breaking out regularly between the M23 and multiple pro-government militias.

{"title": "New Age | Gambia announces mpox outbreak", "body": "The Gambia reported an outbreak of mpox on Tuesday with detection of a single case, as several nearby countries have recorded recent increases in infections. Mpox remains an international health emergency, the World Health Organisation’s director said last month, amid a rise in west Africa. ‘A case of mpox has been detected in the country through the routine surveillance system’, The Gambia’s Ministry of Health said in a statement, adding that the disease was detected on Friday. ‘The detection of a single case in a country where mpox is not presently in circulation constitutes an outbreak, requiring immediate response,’ it said. The ministry said it was actively looking for cases, carrying out contact tracing and community engagement to prevent the disease’s spread. Mpox is caused by a virus from the same family as smallpox. It can be transmitted to humans by infected animals but can also be passed between people through close physical contact. The disease, which was first detected in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, causes fever, muscular aches and large boil-like skin lesions, and can be deadly. It has two subtypes — clade 1 and clade 2. Sequencing is being carried out to determine the virus subtype in The Gambia, the ministry said. From January to late May of this year, nearby Sierra Leone recorded a total of 3,350 cases, including 16 deaths. Liberia had some 71 active cases in early June, according to its National Public Health Institute. Guinea meanwhile reported last week that the number of cases within its border since the disease was detected last September had surpassed 200. Thousands of cases have also been recorded this year across DR Congo, Uganda and Burundi, according to WHO.

{"title": "New Age | China, EU vow to ‘step up’ action on climate change", "body": "China and the European Union vowed Thursday to ‘step up’ action on climate change, according to a joint statement released as Beijing hosted the bloc’s leaders for a one-day summit. The warming planet is historically an area of convergence between Brussels and Beijing, with both sides signalling a willingness to cooperate on combating climate change. The EU aims to become carbon neutral by 2050 while China — the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter — has pledged to do so by 2060. Chinese and European leaders ‘reiterate that in the fluid and turbulent international situation today, it is crucial that all countries step up efforts to address climate change’, the joint statement said. China and the EU agreed on enhancing bilateral cooperation in areas such as ‘energy transition, adaptation, methane emissions management and control, carbon markets and green and low-carbon technologies’. They will also accelerate global renewable energy deployment and facilitate access to green technology, the statement added. This joint declaration ‘sends an important signal that climate cooperation can still rise above geopolitical tensions’, said David Waskow from the World Resources Institute. Stronger climate leadership from the two major emitters is critically needed to rekindle global momentum after the United States announced its withdrawal from the 2015 Paris accord to curb greenhouse gas emissions, he added. And while this agreement between China and the EU is a positive sign, both sides ‘need to get practical’, said Yao Zhe, a global policy adviser at Greenpeace East Asia. ‘Both should demonstrate greater ambition in reducing emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels,’ she added. A top EU climate official told the Financial Times this month that Brussels would not sign a joint climate declaration with China until Beijing adopted bolder emissions reduction goals. An editorial in the state-backed China Daily newspaper then accused the EU of playing the ‘climate card’ to get China to change its position on the Ukraine war.

{"title": "New Age | Troops kill 95 ‘bandits’ in northwest Nigeria", "body": "Nigerian troops killed at least 95 members of an armed criminal gang in a shootout and airstrikes earlier this week, according to a situation report shared with the UN and seen by AFP on Thursday. Armed gangs known as ‘bandits’ have taken root across Nigeria’s rural hinterlands amid poverty and government neglect. They raid, loot and burn villages, exact taxes, and conduct kidnappings for ransom. On Tuesday, Nigerian air and ground troops ‘foiled an attempted bandit attack, launching air strikes and shootouts’ in the northwestern state of Niger, according to the report, which was produced by a private conflict monitor. It added that ‘at least 95 bandits’ were killed in the clash, which occurred near the villages of Warari and Ragada in the Rijau local government area. The Nigerian military put out a statement about the clash Wednesday, saying that forces ‘engaged terrorists in a firefight, neutralising several.’ One soldier was killed, it said. Tuesday’s attack follows a slew of battles where the Nigerian military — which has in the past has been quick to publicise and sometimes exaggerate its gains — has kept relatively mum on apparent victories where scores of bandits were killed. An intelligence source said the military was changing tack after realising publicising their gains was keeping jihadists and bandits abreast of their operations. The army did not respond to a request for comment. Nigeria’s myriad bandit gangs maintain camps in a huge forest straddling Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna and Niger states, in unrest that evolved from clashes between herders and farmers over land and resources into a broader conflict fuelled by arms trafficking. Violence has spread in recent years from its heartland in the northwest — where analysts say some gains have been made by the military recently — into north-central Nigeria, where observers say the situation is getting worse. Increasing cooperation between the criminal gangs, who are primarily motivated by financial gains, and jihadists — who are waging a separate, 16-year-old-armed insurrection in the northeast — has seen attacks worsen. Despite recent gains in the northwest, the military remains overstretched. While improved cooperation between the army and air force has aided the fight, analysts say, air strikes have also killed hundreds of civilians. Between 2018 and 2023, there were more deaths from bandits than there were from jihadist groups, according to figures from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a US-based monitor. Last week motorcycle-riding bandits rounded up a group of farmers working their fields outside Jangebe village in Zamfara state, killing nine and kidnapping around 15 others, local residents said. Earlier this month, Nigerian soldiers killed at least 150 members of a criminal gang in an ambush in northwestern Kebbi state this week, a local official said.

Doctors Without Borders said northern Nigeria, which already is struggling with an insurgency, is ‘currently facing an alarming malnutrition crisis’. Cases of the most severe and deadly form of malnutrition among children jumped by 208 per cent between January and June compared with the same period last year. ‘Unfortunately, 652 children have already died in our facilities since the beginning of 2025 due to a lack of timely access to care,’ the charity, which is known by its French initials, said in a statement released Friday. Huge cuts in foreign aid sparked by US president Donald Trump’s decision to slash spending overseas have combined with spiking living costs and a surge in jihadist attacks to create a dire situation in northern Nigeria. Ahmed Aldikhari, country representative of MSF in Nigeria, said the cuts from the United States—but also from the United Kingdom and European Union—were hampering treatment and care for malnourished children. He said ‘the true scale of the crisis exceeds all predictions’. Pregnant and breastfeeding women have not been spared, as an MSF survey on 750 mothers showed that more than half of them were ‘acutely malnourished, including 13 per cent with severe acute malnutrition’. Across the country a record nearly 31 million people face acute hunger, according to David Stevenson, chief of the UN’s food agency in Nigeria. WFP warned earlier this week it would be forced to suspend all emergency food and nutrition aid for 1.3 million people in northeast Nigeria at the end of July because of critical funding shortfalls.

The country remains split between prime minister Abdelhamid Dbeibah’s government based in Tripoli and a rival administration based in the east. With Italy some 300 kilometres away, Libya has become a key Launchpad for tens of thousands of migrants who risk their lives at sea trying to reach Europe. The area targeted in the sweep east of Tripoli housed makeshift encampments surrounded by high walls and a large gate. Hundreds of migrants—mostly Egyptians and sub-Saharan Africans—were said to have lived there. Inside the compound, an AFP journalist saw a small grocery store, a butcher shop and vegetable vendors. The labour minister said the site had ‘unregulated housing that fails to meet basic requirements for decent accommodation, health and workplace safety’. The detained migrant workers will be ‘transferred to centres run by the Anti-Illegal Immigration Authority, and legal proceedings will be initiated against them according to national regulations’, Abed said. It remained unclear whether the migrants would be immediately deported. Earlier this month, a European Union commissioner and ministers from Greece, Italy and Malta were in Libya to discuss irregular migration from the North African country.

The ADF, originally formed from former Ugandan rebels and which pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2019, raided a Catholic church in the town of Komanda where worshippers were gathered for prayer, residents said by telephone from Bunia, capital of Ituri province. ‘Last night around 9:00pm (1900 GMT), we heard gunfire near the parish church... so far we have seen 35 bodies,’ Dieudonne Katanabo, an Umoja neighbourhood elder, said. ‘We have at least 31 dead members of the Eucharistic Crusade movement, with six seriously injured some young people were kidnapped, we have no news of them,’ Father Aime Lokana Dhego, parish priest of the Blessed Anuarite parish of Komanda, said. The priest added that seven other bodies had been discovered in the town. Likewise attributing the attack to ‘ADF rebels’, Christophe Munyanderu, coordinator of the local NGO Convention for the Respect of Human Rights, gave a provisional death toll of 38. Lieutenant Jules Ngongo, army spokesman in Ituri, did not comment on the toll but confirmed the attack to AFP, stating that ‘the enemy is believed to have been identified among ADF’ rebels. The bloodshed comes after months of calm in the region of Ituri, bordering Uganda. The last major attack by the ADF was in February, leaving 23 dead in Mambasa territory. The town of Komanda in Irumu territory is a commercial hub linking three other provinces — Tshopo, North Kivu, and Maniema. The ADF, originally Ugandan rebels who are predominantly Muslim, has killed thousands of civilians and ramped up looting and killing in northeastern DRC despite the deployment both of the Ugandan army alongside Congolese armed forces in the area.

Sporadic gunfire was heard across Luanda and several other cities on Monday and Tuesday as people looted shops and clashed with police when violence erupted during a taxi strike. The strike was the latest in a series of protests after the price of fuel was hiked from 300 to 400 kwanzas ($0.33 to $0.43) a litre on July 1, squeezing living costs for the millions of poor in one of Africa’s top oil producers. ‘We regret 22 deaths, including one police officer,’ interior minister Manuel Homem told reporters in a press conference on Wednesday. Nearly 200 people were injured in the violence, he said, and more than 1,200 people had been arrested. Shops and businesses remained closed in Luanda on Wednesday as security forces patrolled the city. The streets were largely empty as people stayed home, although there were some queues outside petrol stations and shops, AFP reporters said. Police in the southern city of Lubango confirmed separately that a police officer had shot and killed a 16-year-old on Tuesday. The teenager was part of a group attempting to invade the headquarters of the ruling MPLA party, a statement said. Anger against the price hike was also the focus of a demonstration of around 2,000 people in Luanda on Saturday, with protesters also alleging government corruption. There had been similar protests the two previous weekends. Four people were killed on the first day of the unrest on Monday, according to police. Local media reported other victims on Tuesday. TV Nzinga showed women weeping over a body in a street in Luanda’s central Cazenga area as people ran out of a supermarket carrying food and goods. The report did not say how the person was killed. In the same area, a young man was killed near a supermarket, apparently by a stray bullet, an AFP reporter said. Protests and unrest were also reported outside the capital, including in the city of Huambo, around 600 kilometres north of Luanda, police said. Images on social media also showed protests in the coastal city of Benguela, south of the capital.

{"title": "New Age | Lebanon president promises justice 5 years after Beirut port blast", "body": "Lebanese president Joseph Aoun on Monday vowed justice and accountability five years after a catastrophic explosion at Beirut’s port, as the investigating judge finished questioning defendants, a judicial official said. Nobody has been held accountable for the August 4, 2020 blast — one of the world’s largest non-nuclear explosions, which devastated swathes of the Lebanese capital, killing more than 220 people and injuring over 6,500. Authorities have said the explosion was triggered by a fire in a warehouse where tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser had been stored haphazardly for years after arriving by ship, despite repeated warnings to senior officials. Judge Tarek Bitar resumed his investigation this year as Lebanon’s balance of power shifted following a war between Israel and Hezbollah that weakened the Iran-backed militant group, which had spearheaded a campaign for Bitar’s resignation. Aoun said the Lebanese state ‘is committed to uncovering the whole truth, no matter the obstacles or how high the positions’ involved. ‘The law applies to all, without exception,’ Aoun said in a statement. Monday has been declared a day of national mourning, and rallies demanding justice are planned later in the day, converging on the port. ‘The blood of your loved ones will not be in vain,’ the president told victims’ families, adding: ‘Justice is coming, accountability is coming.’ After resuming work following a more than two-year impasse, Bitar has finished questioning defendants and suspects, a judicial official said. Those questioned include former prime minister Hassan Diab, as well as military and security officials, while several former ministers did not appear for questioning, the official said. Bitar is waiting for some procedures to be completed, including receiving responses from several Arab and European countries following a request for ‘information on specific incidents’, the official added, without elaborating. The judge will then finalise the investigation and refer the file to the public prosecution for its opinion before he issues an indictment, the official said. President Aoun said that ‘we are working with all available means to ensure the investigations are completed with transparency and integrity’. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, a former International Court of Justice judge, said on Sunday that knowing the truth and ensuring accountability were national issues, decrying decades of official impunity. Aoun and Salam took office earlier this year, in the wake of the Israel-Hezbollah war, with both leaders pledging to uphold judicial independence. Officials named in the investigation had filed a flurry of lawsuits seeking to prevent it from going forward. Nobody is currently in custody over the case. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said in a joint statement on Monday that ‘despite the resumption of the investigation, the road to justice remains littered with political and legal challenges’. They urged authorities to ensure a comprehensive, unobstructed investigation that establishes ‘the facts and circumstances surrounding the explosion, encompassing the full chain of responsibility’, whether domestic or international. Mariana Fodoulian from the association of victims’ families said that ‘for five years, officials have been trying to evade accountability, always thinking they are above the law.’ ‘We’re not asking for anything more than the truth,’ she said. ‘We won’t stop until we get comprehensive justice.’ On Sunday, culture minister Ghassan Salame said the port’s gutted and partially collapsed wheat silos would be included on a list of historic buildings. Victims’ families have long demanded their preservation as a memorial of the catastrophe. ‘The silos are the only witness to what happened on August 4,’ said Fodoulian. United Nations special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, on Monday urged authorities to ‘take all necessary action to expedite progress in judicial proceedings related to the explosion’. The US, British and French embassies in Lebanon urged justice and accountability in statements on X. The European Union on Sunday welcomed recent steps ‘that have enabled progress in the investigation’, noting that ‘ending impunity is essential for Lebanon’s recovery.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/272102/lebanon-president-promises-justice-5-years-after-beirut-port-blast", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 671}
{"title": "New Age | Sudan paramilitaries kill 14 civilians fleeing besieged city", "body": "Sudanese paramilitary fighters have killed at least 14 civilians trying to flee a besieged city in Darfur, a rights group said Monday, more than 27 months into their war against the army. The Emergency Lawyers, which documents atrocities in the war between the Rapid Support Forces and the Sudanese army, said that ‘dozens more were injured and an unknown number of civilians detained’ in the paramilitary attack on Saturday on the outskirts of El-Fasher city, in the western Darfur region. The RSF has in recent days launched its latest attack on El-Fasher, the North Darfur state capital which it has besieged since May 2024 but has been unable to seize from the hands of the army. Just two days before Saturday’s attack, the RSF’s political administration urged residents to evacuate to Qarni village, where the Emergency Lawyers says the civilians were killed. ‘I call on you to leave El-Fasher and head to Qarni, the northwest gate of the city, where our forces and the Tasis alliance forces are located and will ensure your safety,’ the RSF-appointed Darfur governor Al-Hadi Idris said in a video address on Thursday. Tasis is an RSF-led political alliance which late last month named leaders of a government based in South Darfur state capital Nyala. The UN has repeatedly warned of the plight of hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in El-Fasher with virtually no aid or services. Families have survived on animal feed, a shortage of which was announced last week. Since April 2023, the war between the army and the RSF has killed tens of thousands, torn the country apart, and created what the UN has called the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. If the RSF captures El-Fasher, it will control all of Sudan’s vast western region of Darfur and, along with its allies, much of the country’s south.

{"title": "New Age | Nigerian military kills 100 ‘bandits’ in northwest raid", "body": "The Nigerian military killed more than 100 members of a criminal gang in an air and ground raid over the weekend, according to a conflict monitoring report produced for the United Nations and seen by AFP on Monday. Armed groups called ‘bandits’ by locals have for years been terrorising communities in northwest and central Nigeria, raiding villages, kidnapping residents for ransom and burning homes after looting them. The military raid in the restive northwestern state of Zamfara was launched ‘in the early hours’ Sunday in the Bukkuyum local government area, where fighter jets in coordination with ground troops pounded a gathering of more than 400 bandits in their Makakkari forest camp. The military’s attack ‘may have occurred in response to consecutive banditry, especially kidnapping, in the state in the previous month’, the report said, noting a link between a recent decrease in military operations in the state and a spate of bandit attacks. Bukkuyum’s Adabka village was on Friday the scene of a bandit attack that saw residents kidnapped and 13 security personnel killed. Bandits had been planning an attack on a farming village when ‘air and ground troops ambushed a bandit camp... killing over 100’, the report said. A spokesman for the Nigerian army did not respond to an AFP request for comment. Nigeria’s ‘banditry’ crisis originated in conflict over land and water rights between herders and farmers but has morphed into organised crime, with gangs preying on rural communities that have long had little or no government presence. Cattle rustling and kidnapping have become huge moneymakers in the largely impoverished countryside. Groups also levy taxes on farmers and artisanal miners. The conflict is worsening a malnutrition crisis in the northwest as attacks drive people away from their farms, in a situation that has been complicated by climate change and western aid cuts. Despite military deployment to fight the criminal gangs since 2015 and the creation of a militia force by the Zamfara state government two years ago, the violence has persisted. In July, Nigerian troops killed at least 95 members of an armed gang in a shootout and air strikes in the northwest state of Niger. But the military is overstretched, with banditry spreading out of its northwestern heartland into central Nigeria. Bandits, who are primarily motivated by money, have also increased their cooperation with Nigeria’s jihadist groups, who are waging a separate, 16-year-old armed insurrection in the northeast.

{"title": "New Age | 40 killed in Sudan’s worst cholera outbreak in years", "body": "Cholera has claimed at least 40 lives in Sudan’s Darfur region over the last week as the country weathers its worst outbreak of the illness in years, Doctors Without Borders said on Thursday. The medical charity said the vast western region, which has been a major battleground over more than two years of fighting between the regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, had been hardest hit by the year-old outbreak. ‘On top of an all-out war, people in Sudan are now experiencing the worst cholera outbreak the country has seen in years,’ MSF said in a statement. ‘In the Darfur region alone, MSF teams treated over 2,300 patients and recorded 40 deaths in the past week.’ The NGO said 2,470 cholera-related deaths had been reported in the year to August 11, out of 99,700 suspected cases. Cholera is an acute intestinal infection that spreads through food and water contaminated with bacteria, often from faeces. It causes severe diarrhoea, vomiting and muscle cramps. Cholera can kill within hours when not attended to, though it can be treated with simple oral rehydration, and antibiotics for more severe cases. There has been a global increase in cholera cases, which have also spread geographically, since 2021. MSF said mass displacements of civilians sparked by the war in Sudan had aggravated the outbreak by denying people access to clean water for essential hygiene measures, such as washing dishes and food. ‘The situation is most extreme in Tawila, North Darfur state, where 3,80,000 people have fled to escape ongoing fighting around the city of El-Fasher, according to the United Nations,’ MSF said. ‘In Tawila, people survive with an average of just three litres of water per day, which is less than half the emergency minimum threshold of 7.5 litres needed per person per day for drinking, cooking, and hygiene.’ At a cholera isolation centre in a tent at a Tawila displacement camp, an AFP journalist saw women and a young girl receiving intravenous fluids, while around them exhausted and weak patients were sprawled out on camp beds. ‘We mix lemon in the water when we have it and drink it as medicine,’ said Mona Ibrahim, who has been living for two months in a hastily-erected camp in Tawila. ‘We have no other choice,’ she said. ‘We don’t have toilets — the children relieve themselves in the open,’ she added. According to the World Health Organisation, between January of 2023 and July of this year, Sudan had the highest number of cholera deaths of any country in the world. Sudan’s mortality rate from cholera, at 2.1 per cent, is more than 2.5 times higher than the global average. Since forces loyal to the regular army recaptured the capital Khartoum in March, fighting has again focused on Darfur, where the paramilitaries have been attempting to take El-Fasher. The besieged pocket is the last major city in the western region still under the army’s control and UN agencies have spoken of appalling conditions for the remaining civilians trapped inside. ‘In displacement and refugee camps, families often have no choice but to drink from contaminated sources and many contract cholera,’ said Sylvain Penicaud, MSF project coordinator in Tawila. ‘Just two weeks ago, a body was found in a well inside one of the camps. It was removed, but within two days, people were forced to drink from that same water again.’ MSF said that heavy rains were worsening the crisis by contaminating water and damaging sewage systems, while the exodus of civilians seeking refuge was spreading the disease. ‘As people move around to flee fighting, cholera is spreading further, in Sudan and into neighbouring Chad and South Sudan,’ it said. MSF’s head of mission in Sudan, Tuna Turkmen, said the situation was ‘beyond urgent’. ‘The outbreak is spreading well beyond displacement camps now, into multiple localities across Darfur states and beyond,’ he said. ‘Survivors of war must not be left to die from a preventable disease.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/273026/40-killed-in-sudans-worst-cholera-outbreak-in-years", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 688}
{"title": "New Age | Libya local vote begins amid security tensions", "body": "Hundreds of thousands of Libyans are voting Saturday in the second phase of municipal elections, held under tight security after incidents and irregularities forced delays at several stations. The elections are seen as a test of democracy in a nation still plagued by division and instability after years of unrest following the NATO-backed uprising that toppled longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011. Polling took place in around 50 municipalities, including the capital Tripoli, with some stations opening at 9:00am local time to serve 380,000 registered voters. A heavy police presence was deployed in the west by the Tripoli-based unity government. Since Kadhafi’s overthrow, Libya has been split between the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, led by prime minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, and its eastern rival, backed by military strongman Khalifa Haftar. After a first phase in November across 58 cities, the vote was initially scheduled in 63 municipalities – 41 in the west, 13 in the east and nine in the south. The High National Election Commission had to suspend elections in 11 municipalities, mostly in Haftar-controlled areas, due to ‘irregularities’ including unexplained halts in voter card distribution. On Saturday, the commission also announced the postponement to August 23 of elections in seven more municipalities, mostly in the west, including four in the Zawiyah area, as well as Surman and Sabratha. The delays followed Friday arson attacks that destroyed electoral materials in Zawiyah and Sahel al-Gharbi, 45 kilometres from Tripoli. And on Tuesday, the electoral body said a group of armed men attacked its headquarters in Zliten, some 160 kilometres east of Tripoli. It made no mention of any casualties, although the UN Support Mission in Libya said there were some injuries. ‘These attacks, on the eve of polling day, threaten the conduct of the ongoing municipal elections and the broader democratic aspirations of the Libyan people,’ UNSMIL said. ‘Such criminal acts represent another grave assault on the electoral process and a blatant attempt to disenfranchise citizens, undermine their right to choose their representatives, and obstruct the democratic process,’ the mission added. For Tripoli resident Esraa Abdelmomen, 36, a mother of three, the municipal elections were ‘very important’ because they determine who would manage the government-allocated funds. Following Kadhafi’s fall in 2011, Libya held its first free elections in 2012 to select 200 members of the General National Congress. That was followed by nationwide municipal elections in 2013 and legislative polls in June 2014, which were marred by renewed violence and very low turnout. In some western municipalities, residents are voting in a local election for the first time since 2014.

{"title": "New Age | Nigerian bandits kill 50 in mosque attack, village raids", "body": "Gunmen killed at least 30 people in an attack on a mosque in northwestern Nigeria earlier this week, according to a resident and a lawmaker, with another 20 people killed in neighbouring villages. ‘Bandits’, as members of criminal gangs are locally known, struck a mosque in the town of Unguwar Mantau, in Katsina state’s Malumfashi local government area Tuesday, with a conflict monitor reporting an initial toll of 13 dead. The attack on worshippers at early morning prayers came despite a rash of recent peace deals in Katsina state meant to stem the tide of gang attacks — though Malumfashi had not been among the local governments to strike a truce. ‘Nine worshippers were killed on the spot and many others died in the course of the day. The latest toll stands at 32,’ resident Nura Musa said on Wednesday. Local politician Aminu Ibrahim told the Katsina House of Assembly on Tuesday that the attackers had killed 30 people. ‘They burnt alive 20 others during attacks on several villages’ nearby, he said. Bandits have for years preyed on rural communities in northwest and central Nigeria, raiding villages, kidnapping residents for ransom and burning homes after looting them. Musa said that Tuesday’s attack came after local self-defence vigilantes had ambushed a bandit gang over the weekend. ‘The vigilantes keep vigil from dusk to dawn, patrolling the village and environs against bandits,’ he said. After ending their watch, they went to the mosque ‘at dawn to say the morning prayers with other worshippers before retiring’, he said. ‘As they were praying, the bandits launched a surprise attack on the mosque. They opened fire on worshippers and fled.’ The bandits also attacked other nearby towns and kidnapped ‘several people’, Musa said. Nigeria’s banditry crisis originated in conflicts over land and water rights between herders and farmers, which has since morphed into organised crime. The gangs have turned cattle theft, kidnapping and imposing taxes on farmers into huge moneymakers across the impoverished countryside, where the government’s presence has long been nearly non-existent. Even in communities that do strike peace deals with bandits, the reprieve can be short-lived if the gunmen or authorities fail to uphold the bargain. Bandits — who often keep the majority of their weapons after any deal — have also been known to exploit truces to establish safe havens in areas covered by such agreements, while continuing to launch attacks elsewhere. Security in Kaduna state’s Birnin Gwari district improved after a truce in November, but neighbouring Katsina and Niger states have seen a rise in bandit attacks. ‘The situation has become unbearable. Our people can no longer live in their villages because of these relentless attacks,’ Ibrahim, the lawmaker, said.

{"title": "New Age | Uganda reaches agreement with US to take migrants", "body": "Uganda has agreed to receive migrants who do not qualify to remain in the United States, a foreign ministry official said Thursday, in Washington’s latest attempt to speed up deportations. US president Donald Trump’s administration has negotiated arrangements to send people to third countries, among them El Salvador and Eswatini, which have been fiercely criticised by rights groups. At roughly 1.7 million Uganda already hosts the largest refugee population in Africa, according to the United Nations, and is the latest east African country to announce such a deal with Washington, joining Rwanda and South Sudan. ‘The agreement is in respect of Third Country Nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States, but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin,’ the Ugandan foreign affairs ministry’s permanent secretary, Vincent Bagiire, said in a statement on X. He said it was a ‘temporary arrangement’, which specified that ‘individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted’. Bagiire also stated Uganda’s preference that ‘individuals from African countries shall be the ones transferred to Uganda’. ‘The two parties are working out the detailed modalities on how the agreement shall be implemented,’ he added. The UN’s refugee agency notes that Uganda — led by president Museveni Yoweri, who has held power for almost four decades — has a ‘progressive refugee policy, maintaining an open-door approach to asylum’. However the country also saw a ‘significant’ increase in arrivals in 2024, it said, primarily as a result of Sudan’s civil war, but also unrest in South Sudan and the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Kampala’s announcement of the agreement comes a day after the country denied any such deal existed. It also comes after Rwanda said it would receive up to 250 migrants earlier this month. Kigali is yet to give any further details of that agreement, which Washington has not confirmed. However the Trump administration has struck a deal with South Sudan. The impoverished and increasingly fragile nation accepted a group of eight migrant criminals from the US earlier this year. Only one of them is South Sudanese. Though their extradition was fought in the American court system, South Sudan confirmed in July that its government had care of the men, without giving further details. Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has taken a number of actions aimed at speeding up deportations of undocumented migrants to countries that are not their own. His administration deported hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, where they were kept in a high-security jail with poor conditions before being returned to Venezuela. Trump’s administration has defended the deportations, arguing that the home nations of some of those targeted for removal sometimes refuse to accept them. But rights experts have warned that the deportations risk breaking international law by sending people to countries where they face the risk of torture, abduction and other abuses.

{"title": "New Age | $346m US-Nigeria arms deal sets rights groups on edge", "body": "Rights groups are questioning a multimillion-dollar arms sale by the United States to Nigeria as security forces in the west African nation continue to be accused of killing civilians with impunity. Last week the State Department approved the possible sale of $346 million in weapons, including bombs, rockets and munitions, to Nigeria, which is battling jihadist militants in the northeast, armed ‘bandit’ gangs in the northwest and separatists in the southeast. Civilians have often been caught in the crossfire: in May, the Nigerian air force bombed a local self-defence group in Zamfara state, mistaking them for bandits, residents said. The State Department’s own annual human rights report on Nigeria, released the same week it approved the weapons sale, warned of air strikes killing civilians and torture of detainees. The sale announcement was ‘conspicuously silent on the Nigerian military’s record of serious human rights abuses and on what safeguards, if any, will be implemented’, Anietie Ewang, Nigeria researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. In an interview with AFP, she added that the US Congress, which has the authority to pause such sales, ‘really needs to ask these tough questions that the State Department is dancing around’. Spokespeople for the Nigerian army, air force and the US embassy in Abuja did not respond to requests for comment. Hundreds of civilians have been killed in air strikes in Nigeria in recent years, though the authorities sometimes dispute hitting civilians. In the Zamfara bombing, the air force said it struck ‘terrorists’. Though violence linked to the Boko Haram uprising has receded since its peak between 2013 and 2015, Nigeria’s security situation remains dire as jihadist attacks continue, including from the Islamic State West Africa Province group. The United States is not Nigeria’s top weapons supplier, typically trailing third behind China and Russia, according to a database on arms sales from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In the past five years, that landscape has shifted, with China, Turkey, Brazil, Pakistan and the Netherlands making up the top suppliers, according to SIPRI’s database of publicly available ‘major conventional arms’ transfers. But ‘the US still remains the beacon of democracy, and it should still be an example of holding those human rights standards’, Isa Sanusi, Nigeria director for Amnesty International, said, calling on Washington to strictly monitor how its arms are used, and whether any are tied to abuses. In a report released this month, the rights group warned of extrajudicial killings by the army in Nigeria’s southeast, along with civilian casualties from airstrikes. Sadeeq Shehu, a former air force spokesman, told broadcaster Arise News that the sale was ‘very good news’, and served as proof of increased civilian protection mechanisms. ‘There are alternatives, but then certain things, you have to get from the Americans,’ Shehu said. The United States supplied $232 million in ‘security sector assistance’, $593 million in foreign military sales and $305 million in ‘direct commercial sales’ from private companies to the country from 2000 to 2021, according to a report from Brown University. But alleged corruption and rights abuses in Nigeria have weighed on the relationship in the past: under president Barack Obama, the United States government blocked arms sales to the country and mostly worked with neighbouring Chad and Niger in the fight against Boko Haram. In 2021, US lawmakers temporarily held up a sale of attack helicopters worth nearly $1 billion over human rights concerns, though it ultimately went through. Malik Samuel, an Abuja-based conflict researcher with the non-profit Good Governance Africa, said while a lack of accountability was a problem in the army, it was also worth questioning why the military’s superior weaponry has not led it to victory. ‘You can’t tell me that the Boko Haram factions or even the bandits have more sophisticated weapons,’ he said, calling for an emphasis on better strategy and intelligence gathering.

{"title": "New Age | Why are countries accepting deportees from the US", "body": "Several poor countries, mostly in Africa, have agreed to take deportees from the United States as part of president Donald Trump’s crackdown on undocumented migrants. What motivates them? The African nations of Rwanda, South Sudan and Eswatini have already accepted deportees — almost entirely citizens of other countries — as has El Salvador in Central America. Uganda, too, has agreed to take deportees, including one of the most high-profile cases, a Salvadoran man named Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to El Salvador in March and alleges torture in prison there before being returned to the United States. The State Department said secretary of state Marco Rubio spoke by phone to Uganda’s long-ruling president Yoweri Museveni last week before announcing Garcia’s deportation, which is currently held up by legal challenges. Details of all these agreements remain murky. Uganda hosts one of the largest refugee populations in the world and receives significant international assistance to support them. It also relies on US aid, especially for its HIV-AIDS programmes. Ugandan opposition leader Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobi Wine, told AFP the government was ‘desperate’ for US backing. He said the deal likely involves ‘hosting individuals with criminal records in exchange for aid, political support and economic cooperation’. South Sudan, a desperately poor country in east Africa on the verge of renewed civil war, accepted eight deportees in July, only one of South Sudanese nationality. All eight were convicted of serious crimes in the United States and were described as ‘barbaric, violent criminal illegal aliens’ by the Department of Homeland Security. ‘South Sudan responded positively to a request from the US authorities as a gesture of goodwill, humanitarian cooperation and commitment to mutual interests,’ its foreign ministry said at the time. Since then, Washington has lifted some visa restrictions on officials that it imposed in April as part of a blanket ban on all South Sudanese entering the US — which it directly linked to the country’s previous refusal to accept deportees. Lily Sukeji Michael, a women’s activist based in the capital Juba, said the government was hoping to see a range of sanctions lifted, including an arms embargo, though that has yet to occur. Rwanda agreed this month to take 250 ‘vetted’ migrants from the US and said Thursday that the first seven have already arrived. The details have not been released, but a similar deal with Britain, signed in 2022, promised Rwanda hundreds of millions of pounds in development assistance, though it was scrapped when the British government changed hands last year. El Salvador’s strongman president, Nayib Bukele, has already taken hundreds of deportees from the US this year, including 252 Venezuelans who were imprisoned for four months. This has bolstered ties with the Trump administration, which has turned a blind eye to Bukele’s rights record, including moves to cancel term limits and widespread allegations of arbitrary detentions and prison deaths as part of a crackdown on gang violence. Bukele feels ‘shielded by his association with the US president’, said Noah Bullock, director of rights NGO Cristosal. Some rights groups are pushing back, especially in Eswatini, a tiny absolute monarchy in southern Africa that took five non-African deportees in July, described by the Department of Homeland Security as having committed ‘uniquely barbaric’ crimes. ‘The Trump administration is targeting weaker democracies where they know there will not be any questions,’ said Melusi Simelane, of the Southern Africa Litigation Centre, one of a group of organisations that has taken the government to court over the issue. The groups believe Eswatini may have been promised trade deals, individual financial incentives or reduced criticism of its rights record. But Mzwandile Banele Masuku, of the Eswatini Litigation Centre, said that, for now, ‘it is all speculation’. None of these deals will make a dent in the numbers leaving the US — which the Department of Homeland Security says reached 1.6 million during Trump’s first 200 days in office. ‘This is more about messaging and deterrence — trying to get people to self-deport and trying to deter people from coming to the US-Mexico border,’ said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington.

The accident occurred late on Tuesday night when the migrants saw the lights of a town off the coast of Mauritania some 80 kilometres north of the capital Nouakchott and “moved to one side, causing it to capsize”, a senior coastguard official said. One of the coast guard’s patrols had been able to rescue 17 people, the official said. An earlier toll had put the number of dead at 49 but a senior coast guard official later revised it higher to 69. According to a statement from the migrants, the boat had left The Gambia a week earlier with about 160 people on board, including Senegalese and Gambian nationals, the official added. Drownings are frequent during the perilous crossing between Africa and Europe, with strong ocean currents and ramshackle vessels making the long crossing dangerous. At least 10,457 migrants died, for example, while trying to reach Spain by sea in 2024, according to the NGO Caminando Fronteras. Officials did not say where the migrants in Tuesday’s accident were headed.

{"title": "New Age | 1,000 killed as landslide flattens Sudan village", "body": "A massive landslide in Sudan’s western Darfur region has flattened an entire mountain village and killed more than 1,000 people, a rebel group said, calling for aid to recover the bodies. The disaster struck Sunday after days of heavy rain, devastating the village of Tarasin in the Jebel Marra area, the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army, led by Abdulwahid al-Nur, said in a statement. ‘Initial information indicates the death of all village residents, estimated at more than 1,000 individuals, with only one survivor,’ the group said, calling the landslide ‘massive and devastating’. The group appealed to the United Nations and other aid organisations for help recovering the dead still buried under mud and debris. ‘This is beyond our capacity,’ the SLM leader Nur said via a messaging app. ‘Masses of mud fell onto the village. Our humanitarian teams and local residents are trying to retrieve the bodies, but the scale of the disaster is far greater than the resources available to us,’ he said. Images the SLM published on its website appeared to show huge sections of the mountainside collapsed, burying the village under thick mud, uprooted trees and shattered beams. Sudan is embroiled in a bloody war between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which has plunged the country into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The SLM controls parts of the Jebel Marra range and has mostly stayed out of the conflict, but hundreds of thousands of people have fled into SLM-held territory to escape the violence. Jebel Marra is a rugged volcanic range stretching about 160 kilometres southwest of North Darfur’s besieged capital of El-Fasher, which the RSF is pushing to capture after besieging it for more than a year. The area is prone to landslides, particularly during the rainy season which peaks in August. A 2018 landslide in nearby Toukoli killed at least 20 people. Darfur’s army-aligned governor, Minni Minnawi, called the landslide a ‘humanitarian tragedy that goes beyond the borders of the region’. ‘We appeal to international humanitarian organisations to urgently intervene and provide support and assistance at this critical moment, for the tragedy is greater than what our people can bear alone,’ he said in a statement. Much of Darfur — including the area where the landslide occurred — remains largely inaccessible to international aid organisations due to the on-going fighting, severely limiting the delivery of urgent humanitarian assistance. The disaster also comes during Sudan’s rainy season, which often renders mountain roads and remote areas impassable. The relentless rainfall further complicates efforts by humanitarian organisations to access those in need, particularly in conflict-affected regions like Darfur where infrastructure is already fragile or non-existent. Since April 2023, Sudan has been ravaged by a war that erupted from a power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. In a series of offensives, Burhan’s forces regained central Sudan this year, leaving the RSF with control over most of Darfur — where it has conquered all but one state capital, El-Fasher — and parts of southern Kordofan. The fighting has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions, including about four million from the capital alone. The war has decimated the northeast African country’s infrastructure and created what the UN describes as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. About 10 million people are currently displaced within Sudan, while an additional four million have fled to neighbouring countries, according to the UN.

{"title": "New Age | Zambia court sentences ex-FM to hard labour", "body": "A Zambian court on Thursday sentenced former foreign minister Joseph Malanji to four years in prison with hard labour for corruption. Malanji, who served under former president Edgar Lungu from 2018 to 2021, was arrested in late 2021 for allegedly using embezzled state funds to acquire property, including two Bell 420 helicopters. The conviction marked a rare victory for state prosecutors in the southern Africa country, ranked among the world’s most corrupt by Transparency International’s 2024 perception index. ‘I have heard the spirited mitigation by counsel and taken note that the convicts are first offenders and are entitled to leniency,’ said magistrate Ireen Wishimanga. The 60-year-old will serve ‘four years imprisonment with hard labour’, she ruled. Malanji’s co-accused Fredson Yamba will serve three years, she added. Yamba, a former secretary to the treasury, was accused of facilitating the transfer of more than $8 million to Zambia’s mission in Turkey without justifying the expense. It was not immediately clear if the pair will appeal the ruling. They were the first top officials from Lungu’s government to be arrested on graft charges after president Hakainde Hichilema took office. Hichilema has repeatedly vowed to root out corruption but critics say progress has been sluggish. More than 64 per cent of the population of copper-rich Zambia live in poverty.

{"title": "New Age | Three quarters of pupils in Sudan out of school: charity", "body": "More than three quarters of school-age children in war-torn Sudan are currently out of school, making it one of the world’s worst education crises, Save the Children said Thursday. A new study by the UK-based charity revealed that 13 million out of 17 million school-age children in Sudan are not attending classes. All 13 million children have been out of school since at least April 2023, meaning they have now lost more than two academic years to violence, the study said. This figure includes around seven million children who are enrolled but unable to access education due to on-going conflict or displacement, and another six million who are not enrolled at all and risk losing their right to an education entirely, the study showed. Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by a brutal war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The war has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated the country’s infrastructure, including schools and hospitals. ‘If the conflict continues, millions of these children will not be able to go back to school, leaving them exposed to immediate and long-term dangers, including displacement, recruitment into armed groups and sexual violence,’ said Mohamed Abdiladif, Save the Children’s country director in Sudan. The study comes after the United Nations’ fact-finding mission on Sudan said this week that girls as young as 12 were being forced into marriage, sometimes under the threat of death to their families. Even before the current conflict began, nearly seven million Sudanese children were already out of school due to poverty and instability, Save the Children said. It added that just under half of schools in the country have reopened in recent months, allowing approximately four million children to resume their education. This comes as relative calm has returned to parts of central Sudan, including the capital Khartoum, after the army regained control of the area earlier this year. Across Sudan, around two million people have made their way back home since November last year, according to the UN’s migration agency. Nearly half of those have resettled in the central Al-Jazira state, followed by Khartoum with over 6,00,000 returnees. Sudan is facing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to the United Nations, with famine declared in a number of refugee camps in Darfur. As of July, nearly 10 million people were forcibly displaced inside the country, while an additional four million had fled across the borders.

{"title": "New Age | US, KSA, UAE, Egypt urge Sudan truce", "body": "The United States, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt called on Friday for a three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan, to be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition towards civilian rule. In a joint statement issued by the US state department, the four countries said the transition should ‘meet the aspirations of the Sudanese people towards smoothly establishing an independent, civilian-led government with broad-based legitimacy and accountability’. Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by war between its army—which maintains control over most state institutions—and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The conflict has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and created what the United Nations describes as one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. ‘Sudan’s future governance is for the Sudanese people to decide through an inclusive and transparent transition process, not controlled by any warring party,’ Friday’s statement said. The statement appeared to have been released in lieu of a meeting involving the foreign ministers of the four countries that had originally been scheduled for July in Washington but was postponed due to disagreements between Egypt and the UAE. Egypt, a key ally of Sudan’s regular army, has consistently called for the protection of state institutions. The UAE, meanwhile, has been widely accused—including in UN reports—of supplying arms to the RSF, a claim it denies. Diplomatic sources told AFP that Cairo objected to earlier language barring both the army and the RSF from taking part in the transition. The final language appears to reflect a compromise, avoiding specific mention of either side while insisting Sudan’s next government be decided by the people. It also explicitly excludes the involvement of ‘violent extremist groups part of or evidently linked to the Muslim Brotherhood’ in the transition process. The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on Sudan’s army-aligned finance minister, Gebreil Ibrahim, a senior Islamist figure, and on the Baraa Ibn-Malik Brigade, an Islamist militia that has been fighting alongside the army. Islamists dominated Sudanese politics for three decades under ousted president Omar al-Bashir and have seen a resurgence during the war, aligning with the army. ‘These sanctions aim to limit Islamist influence within Sudan and curtail Iran’s regional activities, which have contributed to regional destabilization, conflict, and civilian suffering,’ the US Treasury Department said in a statement. Despite international efforts to push for peace, it remains unclear whether the warring factions are willing to engage. In June, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres called for a one-week ceasefire in North Darfur’s besieged capital of El-Fasher. The army agreed to the pause, but the RSF rejected it. Both sides have repeatedly vowed to continue fighting until securing outright military victory. The army currently controls Sudan’s east, north and centre, while the RSF holds parts of the south and nearly all of the western Darfur region—where it recently declared a parallel government, fuelling fears of the country’s fragmentation. Friday’s joint statement, however, maintained ‘there is no viable military solution to the conflict, and the status quo creates unacceptable suffering and risks to peace and security’.

The resolution, adopted on Thursday, calls on Togolese authorities to release Abdoul Aziz Goma, one of 14 people jailed for 10 years in February for ‘plotting against internal security’ after taking part in banned opposition demonstrations in 2018. It condemns Goma’s detention and says he has been held ‘in secret’ and ‘tortured’. A Togolese foreign ministry note says the West African nation considers the resolution a ‘clear interference in a purely judicial and sovereign issue’.

{"title": "New Age | Libya govt reaches agreement with armed group to end Tripoli tensions", "body": "Libya’s UN-recognised government based in Tripoli has reached a preliminary accord with a powerful armed group to end months of tensions that have flared into occasional violence, a government adviser and local media said Saturday. Negotiations between the government and the Radaa Force were facilitated by Turkey, according to the same sources. Ziyad Deghem, an adviser to the head of the Presidential Council transitional body, said the details of the accord ‘will be announced to the public at a later date’. Neither Radaa nor the government have so far made any official comments. However, Libyan broadcaster Al-Ahrar on Saturday posted on X a video that it said showed defence ministry forces entering an airport controlled by Radaa. The North African country is still plagued by division and instability after years of unrest following the NATO-backed uprising that toppled long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. It remains divided between the UN-recognised government in the west and its eastern rival, backed by military commander Khalifa Haftar. In mid-May, there were clashes in Tripoli between forces loyal to the government and armed groups that the authorities are trying to dismantle. Among them is the Radaa Force, which controls the east of the capital and Mitiga airport, as well as prisons and detention centres. According to a source within the group, cited by Al-Ahrah, the two parties agreed to a ‘neutral and unified force... managing and securing four airports’ in the west, including Mitiga. The airport, controlled by Radaa since 2011, is the only one to serve the Libyan capital with commercial flights. Prisons and detention centres managed by the Radaa Force are set to come under the authority of the Attorney General’s office, according to Al-Ahrar. Speaking on the channel, Deghem thanked Turkey ‘for its exceptional efforts’ and the UN mission in Libya for its ‘essential and decisive’ mediation.

{"title": "New Age | 50 Sudanese refugees killed in Libya shipwreck", "body": "At least 50 Sudanese refugees have died off the coast of eastern Libya after their boat caught fire, an International Organisation for Migration spokesperson said Wednesday. ‘The tragic incident took place when a rubber boat carrying 75 Sudanese refugees caught fire off the coast of Tobruk, Libya, while en route to Greece,’ the spokesperson said. ‘At least 50 lives were lost.’ The IOM said in a post on X the shipwreck occurred Sunday. The spokesperson did not provide details of the ages or gender of those on board the boat. ‘IOM provided immediate lifesaving medical care to the 24 survivors,’ the spokesperson added without clarifying if one last person was still missing. Libya is a key transit country for thousands of migrants seeking to reach Europe by sea each year. At least 456 people died and 420 were reported missing along the central Mediterranean route between January 1 and September 13, according to the IOM. Libyan authorities have so far this year intercepted and returned 17,402 migrants to Libya, including 1,516 women and 586 children. The war in neighbouring Sudan between the army and paramilitaries has pushed over 1,40,000 refugees into Libya in the past two years, nearly doubling the number of Sudanese refugees in the country. Many brave near-slavery conditions in Libya, migrants have said, and the dangerous sea crossing in attempts to reach Europe. The IOM considers the central Mediterranean crossing one of the deadliest migrant routes in the world. In 2024, 2,573 people trying to reach Europe died in the Mediterranean Sea, it said. Libya is still plagued by division and instability after years of unrest following the NATO-backed uprising that toppled long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. It remains divided between the UN-recognised government in the west and its eastern rival, backed by military commander Khalifa Haftar. Smugglers and human traffickers have taken advantage of the instability, leading to human rights violations including extortion and slavery, according to rights groups.

{"title": "New Age | RSF strike kills 75 in Sudan’s Darfur", "body": "Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces killed 75 people in a drone strike that hit a mosque in the western city of El-Fasher on Friday, first responders said. The RSF conducted their strike as they pressed a push to capture the last major city in the vast western region of Darfur still under army control. The attack struck worshippers in the city’s Al-Daraja neighbourhood, where civilians from the famine-hit Abu Shouk displacement camp had fled after fighters overran the camp. ‘The bodies were retrieved from the rubble of the mosque,’ the Abu Shouk Emergency Response Room, one of hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating relief across Sudan, said on social media. There was no immediate comment from the RSF on the incident. El-Fasher, which has been under paramilitary siege for about 18 months, is the final state capital in Darfur still under the control of Sudan’s army, which has been locked in a devastating war with the RSF since April 2023. The city’s fall would hand the RSF full territorial dominance over the region, where the UN and rights groups have already reported mass atrocities, including ethnically targeted massacres. Satellite imagery released by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab on Thursday showed RSF forces advancing on multiple fronts, including around Abu Shouk camp and the former UNAMID peacekeeping base, now used by anti-RSF Joint Forces. The Joint Forces, a coalition armed groups, has fought alongside the army since late 2023 after mass killings targeting the Massalit tribe in West Darfur state capital El-Geneina. ‘RSF has likely captured the former UNAMID compound, Joint Forces’ base of operations,’ Yale said, citing damage visible in satellite imagery collected between Monday and Thursday. An RSF source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media, said: ‘By around 2:00pm (Thursday), our forces had taken full control of the UNAMID base.’ Buildings near Abu Shouk have been razed to the ground between Monday and Wednesday, according to Yale’s analysis of low-resolution satellite imagery. RSF units now control much of the famine-hit Abu Shouk displacement camp, a densely populated area just three kilometres north of UNAMID, according to eyewitnesses. This places El‑Fasher airport — the army’s de facto base of operations located three kilometres south of UNAMID — and the army’s 6th Division headquarters both within direct RSF firing range. El-Fasher remains under a communications blackout, making it difficult to verify casualties or coordinate aid. The war in Sudan, now in its third year, has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 12 million and created what the United Nations describes as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. The war has divided the country, with army controlling the country’s north, east and centre, while the RSF dominates swathes of the south and most of Darfur, where it has begun establishing parallel administrative structures.

{"title": "New Age | Guinea votes in constitutional referendum boycotted by opposition", "body": "Guineans began casting ballots Sunday on a draft constitution that would pave the way for elections but also permit the junta leader who seized power four years ago to run for president, in a referendum boycotted by the opposition. The vote, which Guineans and the international community have been awaiting for years, opens the way for stalled political elections in the West African nation. The country has been ruled by General Mamady Doumbouya since he overthrew elected civilian president Alpha Conde in 2021. Some 6.7 million Guineans will be able to cast a ballot, out of a population of approximately 14.5 million people. There was a heavy security presence on the streets of Conakry as polls opened Sunday morning, with armoured vehicles and police checkpoints inspecting vehicles in the city centre. At a school in the capital’s Kaloum district, several dozen people queued as polls monitored by security forces opened at 7:00am (0700 GMT), according to AFP journalists. ‘I came to vote of my own free will,’ said 23-year-old student Ahmad Diallo, with his voter card in hand. ‘This is what everyone is waiting for: to have peace and we want the transition to end.’ First time voter Aisha Camara, 20, said she believed the new constitution was ‘a good thing for Guinea’ adding that she ‘came to support president Doumbouya’. After polls close at 6:00pm, results are not expected until Tuesday evening at the earliest, according to the country’s election body. Authorities are deploying no fewer than 45,000 members of the defence and security forces across the country Sunday to secure the vote, along with 1,000 light and armoured vehicles and combat helicopters, the National Gendarmerie said. Guinea’s military initially pledged to return power to civilians before the end of 2024. Although its authorities are now promising presidential and legislative elections before the end of the year, the junta has not yet set a date. Campaigning has been strong in the referendum’s ‘yes’ camp: rallies, marching bands and posters depicting 40-year-old Doumbouya have been prevalent throughout the country. The ‘no’ campaign, however, was virtually non-existent, mainly taking place on social media and often led by the junta’s critics abroad who fled the country’s crackdown on dissent. Since 2022, the junta has banned demonstrations and has arrested, prosecuted or pushed into exile several opposition leaders, some of whom were victims of forced disappearances. On August 23 the junta suspended two of the country’s main opposition parties for three months. Several media outlets have additionally been suspended and journalists arrested, creating a climate of fear in the press. Given that context, Guinea’s opposition has called on voters to stay home, denouncing the vote as a ‘charade’ for the junta to keep its hold on power, with the referendum’s outcome determined in advance. If adopted, the new constitution would replace a ‘transition charter’ established by the military government, which had prevented the junta’s leaders, government members and heads of institutions from standing in elections. The stipulation does not exist in the draft constitution, thereby paving the way for a presidential run by Doumbouya. All signs point to him standing for office. The draft also requires candidates be between 40 and 80 years of age and have their primary residence in Guinea — effectively excluding two of the main opponents. Former president Conde, 87, is living in exile in Istanbul, while opposition leader and ex-prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, age 73, lives in Dakar and Abidjan. Since Guinea’s 2021 coup, it has remained suspended from the African Union. Meanwhile the Economic Community of West African States, which sent a mission to Guinea in recent days, has not invited it to participate in its heads of state meetings. Writing on X, the UN Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner urged ‘the military authorities to ensure Sunday’s constitutional referendum is peaceful & transparent’. It added that ‘recent bans on political parties & media outlets raise serious questions about inclusiveness & free participation for all’.

{"title": "New Age | New protests in Madagascar despite govt’s dismissal", "body": "Protesters in Madagascar held new demonstrations Tuesday, facing a heavy police presence and teargas, AFP journalists saw, a day after president Andry Rajoelina sacked his government in a bid to quell days of unrest that the UN said has killed 22 people. Inspired by ‘Gen Z’ protests in Indonesia and Nepal, the youth-led movement has taken aim at ingrained misgovernance, fuelled by anger over repeated water and power cuts across the poor Indian Ocean nation. Rajoelina fired his entire government Monday, apologised for his ministers’ inaction and vowed to find a solution to the country’s problems. But it was not enough to put paid to protests, with hundreds turning up Tuesday for a fresh rally in the capital following calls on social media. The sacking ‘was a small victory,’ said 30-year-old activist Masova, using a pseudonym for fear of reprisals. ‘We really want change, the rule of law, justice for all. That’s why it’s no longer just a Gen Z movement,’ she said. Police were deployed in and around the city centre. At one roadblock, they fired teargas to scatter a small crowd that had begun to gather, AFP journalists saw. Minimal activity resumed in the outskirts, with streets filled with schoolchildren and people pulling carts, though traffic remained light. Protesters have demanded that Rajoelina, who first came to power in 2009 following a coup sparked by an uprising, resigns. ‘They call us the TikTok generation, a generation of idiots, and when we rise up, they won’t even let us speak,’ a student protester said Monday, dressed in black in line with a call on social media to mourn those killed. ‘Mr Andry Rajoelina, when you led protests, you were allowed to, it was fine. But when we young people rise to fight for our country, you try to silence us,’ she said. Previous demonstrations have been met with a heavy police response, with at least 22 people killed and more than 100 injured, according to the UN. Some of the victims were protesters or bystanders killed by the police or the security forces, according to the office of the UN’s human rights chief, who condemned the use of live ammunition. The government has rejected the tally as unverified and ‘based on rumours or misinformation’. Protests first started in the capital Antananarivo Thursday before spreading to other cities across the country of nearly 32 million people, according to World Bank data. Last week’s protests in Antananarivo were followed by widespread looting throughout the night, prompting authorities to declare a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Rajoelina, a former mayor of Antananarivo, came to power on the back of a coup that ousted former president Marc Ravalomanana. After not contesting the 2013 election due to international pressure, the 51-year-old leader was voted back into office in 2018. On Monday, he invited applications for a new premier over the next three days before a new government is formed. ‘The president is part of a corrupt system,’ said a 30-year-old agricultural engineer, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ‘He is trying to make us believe that something will change.’ The current unrest is the latest to hit Madagascar since the end of French rule. Philibert Tsiranana, who led the country through the post-independence era, was forced to hand over power to the army in 1972, after a popular uprising was bloodily suppressed. Madagascar ranks among the world’s poorest countries but is the leading producer of vanilla, one of the most expensive spices after saffron, and has natural resources in farming, forestry, fishing and minerals.

{"title": "New Age | Madagascar anti-govt protesters call for general strike", "body": "Anti-government protesters in Madagascar called on Wednesday for fresh demonstrations and a general strike, seeking to force president Andry Rajoelina to step down, after nearly a week of action by the youth-led movement. A crowd of several thousand people marched at midday (0900 GMT) in the northern city of Antsiranana, calling for the president to resign, a local source said. Police had cordoned off the centre of the capital Antananarivo, AFP journalists saw, although life had mostly returned to normal in the rest of the city. Near daily protests began in Antananarivo on Thursday and spread to other cities across the Indian Ocean nation of almost 32 million people. Despite Rajoelina sacking his government on Monday in a bid to quell the unrest, anger over misgovernance and water and power cuts was intensified by a heavy crackdown on protesters, which has left at least 22 dead and more than a hundred injured, according to the UN. The government has rejected the tally as unverified and ‘based on rumours or misinformation’. ‘The dismissal of the government is not enough for us,’ a spokesperson for the ‘Gen Z’ movement leading the protests said Tuesday. ‘We demand the resignation of the president and the cleaning up of the National Assembly,’ said the protester, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Another anonymous demonstrator said that ‘living conditions of the Malagasy people are deteriorating and getting worse every day’. Rajoelina ‘has been in power for 16 years, but nothing has changed’, he said. Rajoelina, 51, first came to power in 2009 following a coup sparked by an uprising, which ousted former president Marc Ravalomanana. After not contesting the 2013 election due to international pressure, Rajoelina was voted back into office in 2018 and re-elected in 2023 in contested polls boycotted by the opposition. More than 10,000 people demonstrated and clashed with police in central Antananarivo Tuesday, according to a security source, where protesters were once again called to convene on Wednesday. On social media, the Gen Z movement called for the dissolution of the Senate, the Constitutional Court and the electoral commission, as well as for businessman Mamy Ravatomanga, reportedly Rajoelina’s main financial backer, to be put on trial. ‘Trade unions from the public sector are called to join a general strike,’ the movement said. Pope Leon XIV on Wednesday said he was ‘saddened by the news coming from Madagascar’ and called for ‘the promotion of justice and the common good’. Madagascar has seen a series of political crises since its independence from France in 1960. The country ranks among the world’s poorest but is the leading producer of vanilla and has natural resources in farming, forestry, fishing and minerals.

{"title": "New Age | Ethiopia church scaffold collapse kills 36", "body": "Makeshift scaffolding set up at a church in Ethiopia collapsed Wednesday, killing at least 36 people and injuring more than 200, state media said. The incident occurred at around 7:45am in the town of Arerti, roughly 70 kilometres east of capital Addis Ababa, when a group was visiting for an annual Virgin Mary festival. District police chief Ahmed Gebeyehu told state media Fana: ‘The number of dead has reached 36 and could increase more’, adding ‘more than 200 people have suffered injuries’ and were receiving treatment at a local hospital. Some people remained under the rubble, local official Atnafu Abate told the Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation, without giving further details about those trapped or possible rescue efforts. He said some of the more seriously hurt were taken to hospitals in the capital. Images shared on the ECB’s official Facebook page showed a mess of collapsed wooden poles, with crowds gathering amid the dense debris. Other pictures appeared to show the outside of the church where scaffolding had been precariously constructed. A government statement shared by ECB expressed condolences, and added that ‘safety must be given priority’. Health and safety regulations are virtually non-existent in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous nation, and construction accidents are common. The sprawling country is a mosaic of 80 ethnic groups and has one of the world’s oldest Christian communities. Its predecessor, the Axumite Empire, declared Christianity the state religion in the fourth century.

{"title": "New Age | Fresh anti-government protests hit Madagascar", "body": "Thousands of protesters marched again in several cities across Madagascar on Thursday while the movement in the capital Antananarivo took a ‘strategic’ break after a week of demonstrations. The Indian Ocean island was awaiting the nomination of a new prime minister after president Andry Rajoelina dismissed his entire government on Monday in a bid to placate the near-daily protests, which started on September 25 over misgovernance and water and power cuts. Calls for Rajoelina to resign intensified after a heavy crackdown and widespread looting in which at least 22 people were killed and hundreds injured, according to the UN — a toll the government denies. Thousands of mostly young people took to the streets Thursday in the large northern city of Antsiranana, an AFP team saw, carrying banners with the message ‘Rajoelina, piss off’ (‘Miala Rajoelina’) and calling the president an ‘assassin’. Hundreds also protested in the southern coastal town of Toliara and in Mahajanga, in the north, according to local media. For the first time since Sunday, the ‘Gen Z’ movement leading the protests announced a ‘24-hour strategic withdrawal’ in Antananarivo to preserve protesters’ ‘health and strength’. In a statement, Amnesty International condemned the ‘unlawful and excessive force used by state security officials’ and called for the authorities to ‘launch thorough and effective investigations’ and release arrested protesters. ‘Every death on the streets of Madagascar is a painful reminder that the right to peaceful protest is under violent attack,’ it said. Earlier Thursday, six foreign embassies and the European Union delegation called in a joint statement for ‘all stakeholders to engage in constructive dialogue’. ‘We reaffirm our commitment to the rule of law and universal rights such as freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,’ the embassies of Germany, South Korea, France, Japan, Britain, Switzerland and the EU delegation said, a day after Rajoelina received representatives of the international community at the presidential palace. Rajoelina, 51, first came to power in 2009 following a coup sparked by an uprising, which ousted former president Marc Ravalomanana. After not contesting the 2013 election under international pressure, Rajoelina was voted back into office in 2018 and re-elected in 2023 in contested polls boycotted by the opposition. On Wednesday, the opposition endorsed the movement through a rare joint statement, with opposition leader Siteny Randrianasoloniaiko and former president Ravalomanana among the signatories. More than 200 local NGOs also called for an ‘immediate end to all forms of repression’, while Pope Leo XIV said he was ‘saddened by the news coming from Madagascar’. Despite natural resources, the nation of 32 million people remains among the world’s poorest countries with nearly 75 per cent of its population living below the poverty line in 2022, according to the World Bank.

{"title": "New Age | Morocco set for fresh protests after demonstrators killed", "body": "Morocco was bracing itself Thursday for a sixth night of protests over corruption and public spending, a day after sporadic clashes with security forces turned deadly and two demonstrators were killed in Agadir in the country’s south. The demonstrations across the usually stable North African kingdom have been fuelled by anger over social inequality as Morocco pushes forward major infrastructure projects to host the Africa Cup of Nations next month and the 2030 World Cup. ‘We don’t want the World Cup, health is a priority’ and ‘we have stadiums, but what about hospitals?’ protesters have chanted during the demonstrations that erupted Saturday with spates of violence in some cities. The protests, which have focused on public health services and education also gained momentum last month following reports of the deaths of eight pregnant women at a public hospital in Agadir. The protests were called by the group GenZ 212, a group formed around the online messaging platform Discord, and whose organisers remain unknown. GenZ 212 has urged demonstrators not to turn to violence, announcing Thursday further ‘peaceful protests will be organised today, as part of a civilised and responsible expression of our demands’. The protests were set to begin at 1600 GMT, the group said, adding that gathering points would be announced later in the day. Since the demonstrations started, hundreds of mostly young people have been arrested. Two protesters were killed on Wednesday night when officers opened fire on a group of demonstrators they said were attempting to ‘storm’ a law enforcement station near Agadir. Local authorities said demonstrators wielding ‘bladed weapons’ had attempted to ‘seize ammunition, equipment and service weapons’ from the police station. Morocco’s interior ministry said on Wednesday that more than 400 people had been arrested during the rallies, with nearly 300 people—mainly from security forces—injured. Some 134 people, six of whom in detention, are set to be tried in Rabat soon, according to lawyers. On Wednesday, rallies in cities including Tangier and Tetouan in the country’s northeast and Casablanca to the west were taking place with official authorisation for the first time since the gatherings began on Saturday. Demonstrators called for ‘the fall of corruption’ as well as ‘freedom, dignity and social justice’, while some urged Prime Minister Aziz Akhannouch to step down. Despite its calls for protests, GenZ 212 has also asserted its ‘love for the homeland and king’, referring to Morocco’s monarch Mohamed VI, saying, however, it stands against some political parties. While most of the protests have been peaceful, clashes and acts of vandalism erupted in some cities, including in Sidi Bibi, near Agadir, where demonstrators set offices of the local commune headquarters on fire, according to media reports and videos on social media. In the city of Sale, north of the capital Rabat, an AFP journalist saw hooded demonstrators set fire to two police cars and a bank branch. Ahead of Thursday’s demonstrations, GenZ 212 has said it ‘rejects all forms of violence, vandalism or rioting’. It reminded protesters ‘to respect the peaceful nature’ of the movement.

{"title": "New Age | Madagascar capital under tight security for new anti-govt protest", "body": "Riot police locked down the centre of Madagascar’s capital on Friday ahead of planned fresh protests against president Andry Rajoelina, the political elite and years of misrule. The near-daily rallies, which began on September 25 in Antananarivo, have since spread to other parts of the Indian Ocean island, posing the most significant challenge yet to Rajoelina’s tenure since his 2023 re-election. The 51-year-old leader, a former mayor of Antananarivo, on Monday sacked his government to placate the anger but protests have gained ground, including in the city of Sambava, known as the world’s vanilla capital and a major foreign exchange earner for the country. After a 24-hour ‘strategic’ pause in the capital, several branches of the protest movement said they would reconvene at 11:00am local time (0800 GMT). But their planned meeting point in the city’s main square was placed under heavy security surveillance, AFP journalists saw. Police pickups sped through the city centre, while shops stayed shut along the capital’s main Independence Avenue. Just three kilometres away, life went on as usual, with schoolchildren in the streets, vegetable vendors opening up and steady traffic flowing. The protesters have demanded that Rajoelina steps down over his failure to deliver basic services, including water and electricity. The ‘Gen Z’ movement leading the protests on Thursday named its spokespeople and outlined its motivations. They have called on more organisations to support their campaign. Several unions, including the national water and electricity workers, have called a general strike, while the opposition, in rare unity, has also thrown its support behind them. Consultations to appoint a new prime minister have meanwhile continued. In a post on his Facebook page Friday, Rajoelina said he had met religious leaders of the country in a bid to quell the crisis and restore order. ‘We prayed for our nation together,’ the president wrote, adding that he also met diplomats and representatives from the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations. It is the latest bout of unrest to hit Madagascar since independence from France in 1960. At least 22 people have been killed and hundreds injured since Thursday last week, according to the UN, a toll the government has denied as based on rumours or misinformation. Rajoelina, a media mogul, first came to power in 2009 following a coup sparked by an uprising, which ousted former president Marc Ravalomanana. After not contesting the 2013 election under international pressure, he was voted back into office in 2018 and re-elected in 2023 in contested polls boycotted by the opposition.

{"title": "New Age | WFP warns of ‘catastophic conditions’ in Somalia as funding dwindles", "body": "Millions of people in Somalia face worsening hunger as major cuts to donor aid leave the World Food Programme with a critical funding shortfall, the UN agency warned Friday. The Horn of Africa nation is among the most vulnerable to climate change, according to the United Nations, and in the last five years has experienced both the worst drought in four decades and once-in-a-century flooding. In November, 7,50,000 people — more than two thirds of the current number — will be cut off from the WFP emergency food programme. That could ‘tip those worst affected into catastrophic conditions,’ the agency said. ‘We are seeing a dangerous rise in emergency levels of hunger, and our ability to respond is shrinking by the day,’ said Ross Smith, WFP’s director of emergency preparedness and response, in a statement. WFP leads the largest humanitarian operation in Somalia and supports more than 90 per cent of the country’s food security response. ‘The current level of response is far below what is required to meet the growing needs,’ Smith said. Government data released in August shows that 4.4 million people are facing acute food insecurity in the conflict-ravaged nation. With about 1.7 million children under five already acutely malnourished — including 4,66,000 in critical condition — WFP said only 1,80,000 are currently receiving its nutritional treatment, a number that could fall even further. Cuts to foreign aid by the United States and other Western countries this year have worsened funding problems in many developing nations. British charity Save the Children warned in May that funding shortfalls would force it to shut more than a quarter of its health and nutrition facilities in Somalia.

{"title": "New Age | Thousands of Nigerians flee to Cameroon after jihadist raid", "body": "Thousands of people in northeastern Nigeria have crossed into Cameroon following a raid by Boko Haram jihadists that left their town in ruins, local sources told AFP on Friday. While Nigeria’s conflict with Boko Haram and breakaway rival Islamic State West Africa Province has ebbed since its peak a decade ago, this year has seen an uptick in violence. Scores of militants stormed Kirawa, in Borno state’s Gwoza district on the border with Cameroon, late Wednesday, setting homes on fire and forcing 5,000 residents to flee the town, Umar Ari, a local anti-jihadist militia leader said. More than half of them boarded trucks and ferries across a river into Cameroon, according to Yakubu Ali, a community leader and head of Kirawa Development Association. ‘The attack forced all the 5,000 residents to leave, with around 3,000 crossing the river into Cameroon, including our traditional chief,’ Ali said. The other 2,000 residents have moved into nearby Nigerian towns of Pulka and Gwoza as well as the regional capital Maiduguri, 130 kilometres away, he said. Kirawa was ‘completely deserted’ after Boko Haram attacked and burnt homes, said resident Hassan Butari, who arrived in Maiduguri on Thursday. People are ‘taking shelter until the situation normalises,’ Butari said. The militants burnt homes, including the palace of the local chief and several vehicles, Butari said. There have been no reports of casualties. Gwoza and surrounding areas have faced Boko Haram attacks since 2014, after the jihadist group seized the town and declared it part of their caliphate. The town was clawed back by the Nigerian military with help from Chadian forces in 2015 but the group continues to launch attacks on communities from its stronghold in the Mandara mountains. Military bases were established in the area to stop the jihadist group’s deadly raids and kidnapping of women who venture into the bush in search for firewood and acacia fruits, but attacks persist. Amid an increase in jihadist violence this year, ISWAP overran at least 17 Nigerian military bases in the first six months of 2025, aided by an uptick in its use of drones, nighttime attacks and foreign fighters, according to researchers at Good Governance Africa, a non-profit. At least 40,000 people have been killed and around two million others displaced since the insurgency began in 2009. The conflict has spread into neighbouring Chad, Niger and Cameroon, prompting a regional military force to fight the militants.

{"title": "New Age | Rival rallies in Madagascar after deadly Gen Z protests", "body": "Backers and foes of Madagascar’s cornered government staged rival rallies in the capital Antananarivo on Saturday following days of fatal youth-led protests the president has termed a coup bid. Inspired by similar movements in Bangladesh, Nepal and Indonesia, the protests led by an online youth movement known as Gen Z Mada, have tapped into widespread frustration over poor governance, with demonstrators calling for President Andry Rajoelina to step down. At least 22 people have been killed and hundreds injured, according to the United Nations, a toll the government has dismissed as based on rumours or misinformation. The anti-government protesters attempted to converge in the centre of Antananarivo but were prevented by a heavy police presence. Officers erected roadblocks, including in the Ambondrona neighbourhood. ‘It’s the shortest route to Ambohijatovo,’ said 18-year-old student Ilan Randrianarison, referring to their planned meeting point. ‘Given the massacres, the protesters are getting angrier and angrier. We’re here for our comrades,’ he said, wearing a straw hat that has become a symbol of defiance. In the capital’s main Independence Avenue, armoured vehicles and military police stood guard. Some officers killed time on their phones, played cards or napped in the shadow of city hall. Supporters of the embattled government meanwhile met at the Coliseum—a Roman-inspired amphitheatre inaugurated by Rajoelina after he was first installed in power by the military in 2009 following a popular uprising. That rally attracted fewer people than the anti-government protests. In the northern city of Antsiranana, hundreds of students also marched, waving placards and carrying a mock coffin covered with orange fabric emblazoned with the image of Rajoelina, AFP journalists saw. Rajoelina, who has rejected calls to resign, on Saturday shared footage of a meeting with trade unions. The 51-year-old former mayor of Antananarivo said on Friday he was ready to listen in order to find solutions to problems facing the poor island nation. He condemned what he said was an attempt to topple his government, without naming who he alleged was behind the move. Gen Z Mada has rejected Rajoelina’s overtures, saying his remarks were ‘completely out of touch with the gravity of the situation our country is facing’. ‘You claim to invite dialogue, yet your words stigmatise precisely those you claim to be listening to,’ the group said in a joint statement with some 20 other organisations. The Council of Christian Churches in Madagascar, known by its Malagasy acronym FFKM and led by Catholic Archbishop Jean de Dieu Raoelison, said on Friday it was ready to mediate between the government and demonstrators. The protests, sparked by public anger over constant water and power cuts, forced Rajoelina to sack his government on Monday but that was not enough to placate the anger. The rallies, which began on September 25, are the latest bout of unrest in Madagascar since it gained independence from France in 1960, posing the most significant challenge to Rajoelina’s tenure since his 2023 re-election. The Gen Z movement demanded on Friday to be ‘consulted and heard’ in the choice of a new premier and called for an investigation into the police response to the demonstrations. ‘We are giving the president 24 hours to respond favourably to these demands,’ said the group, vowing to take ‘all necessary measures’. Rajoelina first came to power in 2009 following a coup sparked by an uprising that ousted former president Marc Ravalomanana. Despite its natural resources, Madagascar remains among the world’s poorest countries. Nearly three-quarters of its population of 32 million were living below the poverty line in 2022, according to the World Bank. Corruption is widespread.

{"title": "New Age | Chad approves unlimited presidential terms", "body": "Chad’s parliament on Friday overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment scrapping presidential term limits, in a move condemned by opponents of president Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno. Deby was first made transitional president by army generals in 2021 after rebels killed his father, Idriss Deby Itno, in a gun battle, ending his 30 years in power in the impoverished central African nation. Deby was then elected head of state in May 2024 for five years, in a contested vote boycotted by a majority of opposition parties. Friday’s parliamentary vote for the constitutional reform, presented by Deby’s Patriotic Salvation Movement, saw 236 of the 257 lawmakers in Chad’s parliament back the move, with no votes against. Max Kemkoye, a spokesman for the opposition platform Group of Political Actors Consultation, told AFP: ‘There is no longer any difference between the MPS and the republic.’ Lawmakers from the opposition National Rally of Chadian Democrats—The Awakening boycotted the vote and left the chamber, an AFP reporter said. In a letter addressed to lawmakers before the vote, the party’s leader, former prime minister Albert Pahimi Padacke, called the change ‘unconstitutional and authoritarian’. The amendment now means Chad’s president can be elected for a seven-year term, and states that he can be re-elected without limit, instead of the current five-year term that is renewable only once. The new longer mandate will only take effect at the next presidential election. But Kemkoye said in a Facebook post on Friday morning that the change effectively ‘gives Mahamat Idriss Deby Itno two bonus years’. The reform also provides for the creation of a deputy prime minister. It extends the term of office of members of parliament by one year, from five to six years. It also restores immunity for government members. In January and February this year, Chad organised parliamentary elections—the first since 2015 -- and a vote for the Senate for the first time in the country’s independent history. The vote was largely won by the president’s MPS. The main opposition party, the Transformers, described the electoral process as a ‘resounding failure’ because of calls for a ‘massive boycott’ by the party and other opposition groups, predicting ‘pre-fabricated results’. Transformers leader Succes Masra—one of the president’s fiercest critics—was sentenced to 20 years in jail in August, on charges of inciting inter-communal violence on May 14 in Mandakao, the southwestern Logone-Occidental region, where 42 people were killed, most of them women and children. His lawyer called the prosecution a weaponisation of the courts.

The Indian Ocean island has seen near-daily rallies over alleged misgovernance and water and power cuts, with protesters clashing with security forces in the capital Antananarivo on Saturday. ‘Certain individuals engaged in violent acts and did not comply with the instructions of the security forces,’ said the joint command, which counts the army, police, and gendarmerie within its ranks. ‘Measures taken by the security forces on the ground depend on the behaviour of the protesters,’ it said. At least 22 people have been killed and hundreds injured since the protests began on September 25, according to the UN, which condemned heavy-handed policing, including the use of live ammunition. Some of the victims were protesters or bystanders killed by the police or the security forces while others were killed in the widespread violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters, the UN said. The government has rejected the toll as based on rumours or misinformation. Calm returned to Antananarivo on Sunday, with only churchgoers and worshippers seen gathering as they came to and from services. The scene was in stark contrast to the day before, when thousands took to the streets demanding president Andry Rajoelina’s resignation, prompting police to fire volleys of tear gas to disperse the crowd. Pro-government supporters also held a rally in the capital, though it drew fewer participants than the opposition protest.

{"title": "New Age | Attack on maternity ward kills 8 in Sudan’s El-Fasher", "body": "A drone strike by Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces killed eight people in a maternity ward in the besieged city of El-Fasher, a medical source said on Wednesday. The RSF is currently waging its fiercest assault ever on El-Fasher in an attempt to wrest control of the city away from their rivals, the regular army. Since April 2023, the war between the two forces has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and pushed nearly 25 million people into acute hunger. Activists say El-Fasher, the last state capital in the vast western Darfur region to elude the paramilitary’s grasp, has become ‘an open-air morgue’ for starved civilians. Tuesday’s deadly strike on El-Fasher Hospital also injured seven people and ‘damaged buildings and equipment’, the health worker said on condition of anonymity out of fear for their safety. The hospital is one of the last functioning health facilities in the city, with most repeatedly bombed and forced to shut. Nearly 80 per cent of households in need of medical care in El-Fasher are unable to access it, according to the United Nations. Exhausted medical teams are already scrambling to treat the injured from the daily attacks on the city. Doctors, using satellite internet connections to circumvent a communications blackout, say they have taken to using bits of mosquito netting as a substitute for gauze. Nearly 18 months into the RSF’s siege, the city — home to 4,00,000 trapped civilians — has run out of nearly everything. The animal feed families have survived on for months has grown scarce and now costs hundreds of dollars a sack. The majority of the city’s soup kitchens have been forced shut for lack of food, according to local resistance committees, volunteer groups coordinating aid. According to UN figures released Tuesday, more than 1 million people have fled El-Fasher since the war began, accounting for 10 per cent of all internally displaced people in the country. The population of the city, once the region’s largest, has decreased by around 62 per cent, the UN’s migration agency said. Civilians say the daily strikes force them to spend most of their time underground, in small makeshift bunkers families have dug in their back yards. Satellite imagery shows the RSF has built dozens of kilometres of walls around the city, leaving only a small exit where they are reportedly extorting civilians for safe passage. The UN has repeatedly warned of ‘large-scale, ethnically driven attacks and atrocities’ in the city, where the RSF has overrun multiple famine-hit displacement camps, killing hundreds. ‘After over 500 days of unremitting siege by the RSF and incessant fighting, El-Fasher is on the precipice of an even greater catastrophe if urgent measures are not taken to loosen the armed vice upon the city and to protect civilians,’ UN rights chief Volker Turk said Thursday.

{"title": "New Age | Ethiopia accuses Eritrea of ‘actively’ preparing for war", "body": "Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of joining forces with a hardline opposition faction in preparing to launch a war, according to a letter from the foreign affairs ministry obtained by AFP on Wednesday. The Tigray People’s Liberation Front, which dominated Ethiopian politics for some 30 years, has been banned from political activity. Relations have been extremely strained for several months between the two neighbours, more than 30 years after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia after a decades-long armed struggle. Ethiopia’s foreign minister wrote in the letter to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres that ‘the collusion between the Eritrean government and the TPLF has become more evident over the past few months...’. ‘The hardliner faction of the TPLF and the Eritrean government are actively preparing to wage war against Ethiopia,’ it added. The government in Addis Ababa also accuses its counterpart in Asmara and the TPLF of ‘funding, mobilising and directing armed groups’ in the Amhara region, where the federal army has been facing rebels for several years. Eritrea’s information minister Yemane Ghebremeskel and the TPLF have so far not responded to AFP’s requests for comment on the accusations. After independence in 1993, a bloody border war erupted between the two Horn of Africa countries from 1998 to 2000, leaving tens of thousands dead. Relations thawed in 2018 after Ethiopian prime minister Abiy Ahmed came to power and signed a peace deal with president Isaias Afwerki, who has ruled Eritrea with an iron fist since independence. The peace agreement earned Abiy a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. Eritrean troops backed Ethiopian federal forces during the bloody war in the northern Tigray region between 2020 and 2022, which left an estimated 6,00,000 people dead, according to the African Union. Since the conflict ended, relations have again turned frosty, with Asmara accusing its landlocked neighbour of eyeing the Assab port on the Red Sea in southeastern Eritrea. Abiy has repeatedly reiterated his desire for Ethiopia to regain sea access, lost legally after Eritrea’s independence. Ethiopian foreign minister Gedion Timothewos in the letter said Addis Ababa wants ‘to engage in good faith negotiations with the government of Eritrea’. He accused Asmara of trying ‘to justify its sinister machinations against Ethiopia by claiming that it feels threatened by Ethiopia’s quest to gain access to the sea’. In June, a report by a US monitoring group accused Eritrea of rebuilding its army and destabilising its neighbours. Ghebremeskel, Eritrea’s information minister, criticised the report by the NGO The Sentry and blamed ‘the new tension in the region’ on Ethiopia. Eritrea, one of Africa’s least populated countries with about 3.5 million people, has in recent months strengthened ties with Egypt, which also has strained relations with Ethiopia.

{"title": "New Age | Police meet fresh 1,000-strong protest in Madagascar with tear gas", "body": "At least 1,000 anti-government demonstrators marched on Thursday through Madagascar’s capital, where police fired tear gas to try and disperse the latest youth-led protest of the past two weeks. The fresh rally came after the Gen Z movement called for a general strike and rejected president Andry Rajoelina’s attempts to defuse the tensions rocking the Indian Ocean island. The president has appointed a new prime minister and called for dialogue. Security forces charged at protesters with armoured vehicles, firing tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowds that gathered on Thursday near Lake Anosy and started marching towards the Ambohijatovo Gardens, AFP reporters saw. The gardens in the city centre have been dubbed Democracy Square. Groups of mostly young demonstrators, some wearing gas masks or diving masks, scattered throughout the Anosy neighbourhood, while police made arrests. The near-daily protests erupted on September 25 in anger over regular and lengthy power and water shortages in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world, and evolved into a broader anti-government movement. Madagascar has seen several popular uprisings since it gained independence in 1960 and has a long history of military rule. The Gen Z movement seemed to be running out of steam in recent days but rallies were still held almost daily in Antananarivo and major cities across the huge island country. Hundreds of protesters again marched through the large southern coastal city of Toliara on Thursday, reports said. ‘We’re still struggling,’ said Heritiana Rafanomezantsoa, one of the marchers in Antananarivo. ‘The problem is the system. Our lives haven’t improved since we gained independence from France,’ the 35-year-old said. Student Niaina Ramangason said Rajoelina — who himself came to power following an uprising in 2009 — was ‘selfish’. ‘He makes promises but doesn’t keep them. I don’t believe in him anymore,’ the 20-year-old said. After initially adopting a conciliatory tone and dismissing his entire government, Rajoelina appointed a military officer as prime minister on October 6. He said the country ‘no longer needs disturbances’ and chose to make the first appointments in his new cabinet to the ministries of the armed forces, public security and armed police. More than 200 civil society organisations said on Thursday they were ‘concerned about a military drift in the country’s governance, rather than a search for appeasement and an end to repression’. The United Nations said on September 29 that at least 22 people had been killed in the first days of protests, a toll Rajoelina disputed on Wednesday. ‘There have been 12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals,’ he told French-speaking television channel Reunion La Premiere. The UN’s human rights office said some of the 22 victims were protesters or bystanders killed by security forces, while others had died in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters in the wake of the demonstrations. Twenty-eight protesters have been referred to the prosecutor’s office for formal charges, their lawyers said on Wednesday. Five are in pre-trial detention in Tsiafahy prison, a jail described by Amnesty International as overcrowded and ‘hellish’. The protest movement has issued Rajoelina with a list of demands that includes a public apology for the violence against them but no longer mentions its previous calls for him to step down. Despite rich natural resources, nearly three quarters of Madagascar’s population of 32 million lived below the poverty line in 2022, according to World Bank figures. The Indian Ocean island’s per capita GDP fell from $812 in 1960 to $461 in 2025, according to the World Bank.

{"title": "New Age | Eritrea condemns Ethiopia’s ‘provocative sabre-rattling’", "body": "Eritrea on Thursday dismissed an accusation by Ethiopia that it is preparing to launch a war as ‘provocative sabre-rattling’ amid mounting tensions between the Horn of Africa neighbours. Relations have been strained for several months, more than 30 years after Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia following a decades-long armed struggle. Ethiopia’s foreign ministry sent a letter to UN secretary general Antonio Guterres earlier this month accusing Asmara of colluding with a hardline faction of the opposition Tigray People’s Liberation Front to ‘wage war’. According to the letter signed by the foreign minister, the two have been ‘funding, mobilising and directing armed groups’ in the Amhara region, where federal forces have battled rebels for several years. ‘The intense propaganda campaign aimed at whipping up irredentist ambitions has been accompanied by provocative sabre-rattling,’ Eritrean Information Minister Yemane Ghebremeskel said. He condemned Addis Ababa’s letter to the UN as a ‘deceitful charade’. In another letter dated Wednesday and received by AFP on Thursday, the TPLF said Ethiopia’s accusations were ‘entirely unfounded’. ‘We are, however, deeply concerned that the federal government appears to be building a case for yet another war in the region based on unfounded allegations,’ the latest letter said. It was also addressed to the UN secretary general and called for mediation by the African Union and the international community. The party dismissed the letter by Addis Ababa as a ‘dangerous inversion of reality’. It is ‘an attempt to portray the aggressor as the victim and the victims as the aggressor’, it said. After Eritrea’s independence in 1993, a bloody border war erupted between the two countries from 1998 to 2000, leaving tens of thousands dead.

Ghebremeskel accused Ethiopia of plotting to undermine Eritrea’s ‘hard-won independence and its sovereignty’ by seeking renewed access to the port. ‘For the last two years, the regime’s policy mantra has revolved on acquiring sovereign access to the sea through legal means if possible, or military force if necessary,’ he said. In June, a report by a US monitoring group accused Eritrea of rebuilding its army and destabilising its neighbours but Eritrea criticised the report and blamed ‘the new tension in the region’ on Ethiopia.

{"title": "New Age | Burkina says will not take people deported from US", "body": "Burkina Faso, ruled by a junta hostile to the West, has refused to take in people kicked out of the United States, in a snub to one of president Donald Trump’s signature migration policies. Since Trump’s return to the White House, his administration has made deporting people to third countries — often to nations they have no connection to — part of a sweeping immigration crackdown. In Africa, Eswatini, Ghana, Rwanda and South Sudan have all accepted people expelled from the United States in recent months. But late on Thursday, Burkina Faso’s foreign affairs minister said the west African country had refused Washington’s overtures. ‘Naturally, this proposal, which we considered indecent at the time, runs completely contrary to the principle of dignity,’ Karamoko Jean-Marie Traore said on national television. Hours earlier, the US embassy in the capital Ouagadougou announced the suspension of regular services for most visas for people living in Burkina Faso. Instead, Burkinabe citizens will now have their services handled in Lome, the capital of neighbouring Togo. ‘Is this a way to put pressure on us? Is this blackmail? Whatever it is Burkina Faso is a place of dignity, a destination, not a place of expulsion,’ Karamoko Jean-Marie Traore said. Burkina Faso’s leader, Captain Ibrahim Traore, styles himself as an anti-imperialist Pan-African strongman. Since seizing power in a coup in September 2022, he has shunned former colonial master France and the wider West, forging closer ties with Russia instead.

{"title": "New Age | Madagascar soldiers join protestors", "body": "Groups of Madagascar soldiers joined thousands of protestors in the capital Saturday, AFP reporters said, after announcing they would refuse any orders to shoot demonstrators. Fresh youth-led demonstrations in Antananarivo drew large crowds in one of the biggest gatherings since a protest movement erupted on the Indian Ocean island on September 25. After police used stun grenades and tear gas to try to disperse the demonstrators, soldiers arrived at the heart of the gathering near the Lake Anosy area where they were welcomed with cheers. Protesters called out ‘Thank you!’ to the soldiers, some of whom were waving Madagascar flags, the images showed. At a meeting at an army barracks on the outskirts of the city earlier, the soldiers said they would not take action against the protestors. ‘Let us join forces, military, gendarmes and police, and refuse to be paid to shoot our friends, our brothers and our sisters,’ the soldiers at the base in Soanierana district said in a video posted on social media. They called on soldiers at the airport to ‘prevent all aircraft from taking off’ and those in other camps to ‘refuse orders to shoot your friends’. ‘Close the gates and await our instructions,’ they said. ‘Do not obey orders from your superiors. Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades-in-arms, because they will not take care of our families if we die.’ The demonstrations on Saturday were the largest in several days in the youth-led movement that was sparked by anger over power and water shortages and evolved into a broader anti-government movement. It was unclear how many soldiers had joined the call on Saturday. In 2009, the military base in Soanierana led a mutiny in a popular uprising that brought the current president, Andry Rajoelina, to power. The newly appointed minister of the armed forces called on troops to ‘remain calm’ in a press conference Saturday . ‘We call on our brothers who disagree with us to prioritise dialogue,’ Minister General Deramasinjaka Manantsoa Rakotoarivelo said. ‘The Malagasy army remains a mediator and constitutes the nation’s last line of defence,’ he said. Several people were injured on Thursday as security forces dispersed protesters with tear gas, rubber bullets and armoured vehicles. Videos of police violence went viral on social media, including a video of one man being left unconscious on the ground after he was chased and severely beaten by security forces, which AFP reporters also witnessed. The United Nations on Friday reacted by calling on authorities to ‘desist from unnecessary force and to uphold the rights to free association and peaceful assembly’. The UN has said that at least 22 people were killed in the first days of the protests that started on 25 September at the call of a youth-led movement called ‘Gen Z’. President Andry Rajoelina has disputed the toll, saying on Wednesday that there were ‘12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals’. Rajoelina initially adopted a conciliatory tone and sacked his entire government in response to the protests. But he has since doubled down, appointing a military officer as prime minister on October 6 and picking the first members of his new cabinet from among the armed forces, public security and armed police, announcing that the country ‘no longer needs disturbances’. Among the world’s poorest countries, Madagascar has undergone frequent popular uprisings since independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-president Marc Ravalomanana from power as the military installed Rajoelina for his first term. He won re-election in 2018 and again in 2023 in contested polls boycotted by the opposition.

{"title": "New Age | RSF attack kills 60 in Sudan’s El-Fasher", "body": "A drone and artillery attack killed at least 60 people at a displacement camp in Sudan’s El-Fasher on Saturday, activists said, as the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces intensifies its assault on the besieged western city. The resistance committee for El-Fasher, the North Darfur state capital, said the RSF hit the Dar al-Arqam displacement centre on the grounds of a university. ‘Children, women and the elderly were killed in cold blood, and many were completely burned,’ it said. ‘The situation has gone beyond disaster and genocide inside the city, and the world remains silent.’ The committee had initially put the toll at 30 dead, but said bodies remained trapped underground. It later said 60 were killed in the attack involving two drones and eight artillery shells. The local resistance committees are activists who coordinate aid and document atrocities in the Sudan conflict. The RSF has been at war with the regular army since April 2023. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and pushed nearly 25 million into acute hunger. El-Fasher, the last state capital in the vast region of Darfur to elude the RSF’s grasp, has become the latest strategic front in the war as the paramilitaries attempt to consolidate power in the west. The United Nations rights chief said Friday that he was ‘appalled’ by the RSF’s recent killing of civilians in the city, including what appeared to be ethnically motivated summary executions. ‘They continue instead to kill, injure, and displace civilians, and to attack civilian objects, including... hospitals and mosques, with total disregard for international law,’ UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said. Activists say the city has become ‘an open-air morgue’ for starved civilians. Nearly 18 months into the RSF’s siege, El-Fasher—home to 400,000 trapped civilians—has run out of nearly everything. The animal feed that families have survived on for months has grown scarce and now costs hundreds of dollars a sack. The majority of the city’s soup kitchens have been forced shut for lack of food, according to the local resistance committees. In El-Fasher on Thursday, eyewitnesses said an RSF artillery attack killed 13 people in a mosque where displaced families were sheltering. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, 20 people were killed in RSF strikes on El-Fasher Hospital, one of the last functioning health facilities in the city. Pointing to other recent attacks on a maternity hospital, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called on Saturday for ‘immediate protection of health facilities, and also humanitarian access, so we can support patients requiring urgent care and health workers in dire need of health supplies’. Most hospitals in El-Fasher have been repeatedly bombed and forced to shut, leaving nearly 80 per cent of those in need of medical care unable to access it, according to the United Nations. Last month, at least 75 people were killed in a single drone strike on a mosque in the city. According to UN figures released Tuesday, more than one million people have fled El-Fasher since the war began, accounting for 10 per cent of all internally displaced people in the country. The population of the city, once the region’s largest, has decreased by about 62 per cent, the UN’s migration agency said. Civilians say the daily strikes force them to spend most of their time underground, in small makeshift bunkers families have dug into their backyards. If the city falls to the paramilitaries, the RSF will be in control of the entire Darfur region, where they have sought to establish a rival administration. The army holds the country’s north, centre and east.

{"title": "New Age | Morocco’s GenZ 212 pauses protests", "body": "Morocco’s GenZ 212 youth collective said Saturday it was temporarily suspending protests after two weeks of demonstrations calling for reforms in health and education. The weekend pause was ‘a strategic step to strengthen organisation and coordination, so the next phase of the movement is more effective and influential’, the group said in a statement. GenZ 212 said its demands were unchanged, citing ‘accountability for the corrupt’ and government responsibility for worsening social and economic conditions. A new call for mobilisation would be announced later Saturday, it said, adding the next protest would ‘target the government and all those blocking the aspirations of the Moroccan people’. Formed in late September, GenZ 212 has built a large online following, with more than 200,000 members on the Discord platform. Its rallies, held almost nightly across the North African country, have attracted crowds ranging from dozens to several hundred people. The protests erupted after the deaths of eight pregnant women during Caesarean sections at a public hospital in Agadir, in southern Morocco, sparked anger over conditions in the health sector. GenZ 212 has appealed directly to King Mohammed VI to deliver reforms. In a speech on Friday, the monarch urged the government to accelerate development in education and health, without directly referring to the protests. He said Morocco was ‘paving a steady path toward greater social and territorial justice’, and called for special attention to the country’s poorest regions.

{"title": "New Age | Madagascar president says power grab happening as army unit claims control", "body": "A Madagascar army unit declared Sunday that it was taking control of all the country’s military forces as president Andry Rajoelina said an ‘attempt to seize power illegally’ was under way. Soldiers from the CAPSAT contingent also joined thousands of people in the capital to remember lives lost in more than two weeks of anti-government demonstrations that erupted on September 25. The unit, which played a major role in a 2009 coup that brought Rajoelina to power, on Saturday declared it would ‘refuse orders to shoot’ on the demonstrators. Soldiers then entered the city centre to meet several thousand protesters, who welcomed them with jubilation and praise. On Sunday morning they claimed in a video statement that ‘from now on, all orders of the Malagasy army — whether land, air or the navy — will originate from CAPSAT headquarters’. They named General Demosthene Pikulas as the head of the army, although it was not clear if the posting could be considered official. There was no immediate response from other units or the existing military command. ‘We will prevail, because evil will not prevail in Madagascar,’ CAPSAT Colonel Michael Randrianirina said at prayers held later Sunday to remember people who died in the upheaval, including a soldier said to have been killed in clashes the previous day with the gendarmerie. The United Nations has said that at least 22 people were killed in the first days of the protests, some by security forces and others in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters in the wake of the demonstrations. Rajoelina has disputed the toll, saying last week there were ‘12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals’. The officers were joined on stage at the commemoration and prayers by several opposition political figures, including former president Marc Ravalomanana, who was ousted in the 2009 uprising. A wreath was laid carrying the message ‘For all the victims who died for the nation’. The protests were initially focused on chronic power and water cuts in the impoverished Indian Ocean country but developed into a broader anti-government movement that called for 51-year-old Rajoelina to resign. In a statement Sunday, the president said ‘an attempt to seize power illegally and by force, contrary to the Constitution and to democratic principles, is currently under way.’ ‘Dialogue is the only way forward and the only solution to the crisis currently facing the country,’ he said. Officers of the gendarmerie, accused of heavy-handed tactics against the demonstrators, said in a video statement meanwhile that they recognised ‘faults and excesses during our interventions’ and called for ‘fraternity’ with the army. ‘We are here to protect, not to terrorise,’ they said, adding that ‘from now on, all orders will come solely’ from the gendarmerie’s headquarters. Meeting one of the demands of a protest movement led by a youth group called Gen Z, the Senate announced Sunday the dismissal of its president, Richard Ravalomanana, a former general of the gendarmerie paramilitary police unit. The upheaval is the most significant challenge to Rajoelina’s tenure since his 2023 re-election. To try to defuse the protests, he last month sacked his entire government although his choice of an army general as new prime minister was contested. Amid rumours that he had fled, his government said Saturday he remained in Madagascar and was managing national affairs. The newly appointed prime minister, Ruphin Zafisambo, said the government was ‘standing strong’ and ‘ready to collaborate and listen’. Air France suspended its flights to the island until at least Tuesday while the African Union expressed ‘deep concern’ and urged dialogue, calm and restraint. South Africa called upon ‘all parties to respect the democratic process and constitutional order’. Madagascar has had a turbulent political history since it gained independence from France in 1960. Although rich in natural resources for farming, forestry, fishing and minerals, nearly three-quarters of the population of 32 million lived below the poverty line in 2022, according to the World Bank.

{"title": "New Age | President flees amid Gen Z protests in Madagascar", "body": "Madagascar’s president, Andry Rajoelina, is reported to have fled the country on a French military aircraft, hours before he was scheduled to address the people, reports The Guardian. French state radio RFI reported on Monday that the president, who also has French citizenship, had been flown out of the capital, Antananarivo, after a deal with president Emmanuel Macron. It added that he may have headed for Dubai. He had been due to speak to the nation at 7:00pm (1600 GMT), according to a statement from the presidency on Facebook. Rajoelina, 51, was first president from 2009 to 2014 before returning to power in 2023. He was increasingly isolated after losing the support of a key army unit that joined thousands of youths activists known as ‘Gen Z Madagascar’ to protest against corruption and poverty. The movement had earlier turned down an invitation to meet him for dialogue and demanded his resignation. People flooded a square in front of the Antananarivo city hall on Monday, waving flags and chanting slogans, some hanging off military vehicles as they arrived, according to Agence France-Presse reporters. Among the demonstrators were soldiers from the elite Capsat unit, which played a major role in the 2009 coup during Rajoelina’s rise to the presidency after mass protests forced his predecessor Marc Ravalomanana out of power. Also present were gendarmerie officers, accused of using heavy-handed tactics during the near-daily protests over more than two weeks. They admitted in a video statement to ‘faults and excesses’ in their response. At least 22 people were killed in the first days by security forces and others in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters, according to the UN. But Rajoelina had disputed the toll, saying last week there were ‘12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals’.

Point your weapons at those who order you to fire on your comrades in arms because they will not take care of our families if we die.’ The showdown began following the arrest of two politicians on 19 September after planning a protest against the country’s chronic power and water outages.

It is this committee that will carry out the work of the presidency,’ Randrianirina said. ‘At the same time, after a few days, we will set up a civilian government,’ he said. ‘We have taken power,’ he confirmed to AFP afterwards. After the announcement, officers from the unit rolled through the capital in armoured Humvees and pick-up trucks, AFP journalists saw. Crowds lined the pavements, cheering and waving as they passed, while some followed the convoy in their own cars, honking their horns in a victory lap through a city still on edge. The near-daily protests, led by a youth movement called Gen Z, took a turn at the weekend when CAPSAT — which played a major role in the 2009 coup that first brought Rajoelina to power — joined the demonstrators. They were followed by the gendarmerie paramilitary police force, which admitted to ‘faults and excesses’ in their response to the demonstrations. Parliamentarians on Tuesday pushed ahead with the impeachment vote despite Rajoelina’s attempt to block it by issuing a decree hours earlier to dissolve the national assembly. The impeachment vote passed with 130 votes in favour — well above the two-thirds constitutional threshold required in the 163-member chamber. In a statement as voting was under way, the presidency said the session was ‘devoid of any legal basis’. The youth-led protests were ignited by anger over power and water shortages before developing into demonstrations against the president and ruling elite. After reports that he had left the country with the assistance of France, Rajoelina said in a national address late Monday that he was in a ‘safe place to protect my life’ but did not reveal his location. The 51-year-old made clear he would not step down, saying he was ‘on a mission to find solutions’ to the political crisis and would not let the impoverished Indian Ocean nation ‘destroy itself’. Civil servants and trade unionists joined the large crowd in the capital in a fresh demonstration demanding that Rajoelina quit and also expressing anger at reports of French involvement in helping him leave the country. Before Monday’s address, Rajoelina had not appeared in public since Wednesday when he pledged at a public meeting to address complaints against his government. The United Nations has said at least 22 people were killed in the first days of the protests, some by security forces and others in violence sparked by criminal gangs and looters. Rajoelina later disputed the toll, saying there were ‘12 confirmed deaths and all of these individuals were looters and vandals’. To try to defuse the protests, Rajoelina sacked his entire government last month. Meeting one of the demands of the protesters, the president of the Senate was replaced. Madagascar has had a turbulent political history since the country off the east coast of Africa gained independence from France in 1960.

{"title": "New Age | Madagascar’s main university: a tale of ruin, revolt", "body": "A stagnant puddle lay in the hallway of the university residence that had only opened two years ago, despite the rainy season in Madagascar not yet having arrived. ‘Come see our dormitories,’ student Ulric Sambizafy offered at one of a wave of protests that have rocked the Indian Ocean island nation since September 25. Trash floated in an open-air wastewater drain two metres (6.5 feet) from his back door. ‘During the rainy season, we’ll have sewage up to here,’ said the 24-year-old master’s student in renewable energy, pointing to his mid-calf. ‘That’s what justifies our revolt,’ he told AFP. Originally from eastern Madagascar, Sambizafy is among the educated Malagasy youth swelling the ranks of the Gen Z movement behind the protests that led parliamentarians to vote to impeach President Andry Rajoelina on Tuesday and an elite military unit to seize power. The building in Ankatso, a neighbourhood in the capital Antananarivo, was only opened in 2023 but cracks and leaks reveal major construction defects. There is also only one working shower for eight residents. The shared toilet does not flush so students clear it by filling buckets in the courtyard, where the sounds of French rapper MHD echo. ‘Malagasy youth are ignored since the children of this country’s leaders don’t study at the University of Antananarivo but rather in Bordeaux, MIT, Harvard and all those places,’ Sambizafy said. The protests were ignited by anger over frequent and lengthy cuts to power and water in one of the world’s poorest countries and evolved into an outpouring of anger against the government. Rajoelina promised last week to ‘take a close look’ at the conditions of Madagascar’s youth, especially university students and their housing. With the newly named prime minister, Major General Ruphin Fortunat Dimbisoa Zafisambo, he would build a university that meets the needs of all students, he said. Sambizafy scoffed. ‘There’s a Malagasy proverb that says, “You haven’t finished what’s on your plate, but you already want what is in the pot’’,’ he said, lowering the flame on the stove to stop a pot of rice from boiling over. These dorms were not the worst student lodgings in the Ankatso university district, the heart of the protest movement and also the cradle of 1972 protests that led to the ousting of Madagascar’s first president after its independence from France in 1960. The neighbouring yellow four-storey building, meant to accommodate 400 but holding many more, was even more dilapidated. It was opened about 10 years ago but none of the older residents remember the plugs or taps in the communal kitchen ever working. ‘It’s used as a garage for scooters,’ said Polytechnic student Iandoharilala Rakotondrina, 30, pointing to a pair of two-wheelers parked in the first-floor room. In the bathrooms and laundry on the third floor, barely a trickle of water came out the taps because of a lack of pressure. On the wall, a sheet of paper listed a student cleaning schedule but some toilets were beyond maintenance, the lack of water adding to a state of ruin. ‘We’re literally living in filth,’ said Rakotondrina on a tour permeated by the powerful stench of urine. As there are not enough rooms to accommodate students from outside the capital, six students were squeezed into Ezechiel Ledy’s dorm meant for four. It is not unusual for students to share a bed or put mattresses on the floor of the rooms, which measure just 18 square metres (194 square feet). The fuse box was burnt out and clothes dried on wire stretched across the stairwell. A student offered barber services in front of a broken mirror for 2,000 ariary a haircut, less than 0.40 euros and half of the cost in the city. ‘Young Malagasy people are very good at adapting to all conditions,’ said Ledy, a second-year master’s student. ‘Maybe that’s why the leaders think it’s not worth helping them.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/279137/madagascars-main-university-a-tale-of-ruin-revolt", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 677}
{"title": "New Age | Kenya opposition leader Raila Odinga dies", "body": "Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, a ‘towering statesman’ over decades of upheaval, died at the age of 80 on Wednesday during a health visit to India — a political earthquake that leaves the east African nation on an uncertain path. Emotional scenes of mourning broke out across Kenya for its perennial opposition figure, who ran unsuccessfully for the presidency five times, most recently in 2022. Hundreds gathered at his residence in Nairobi, many visibly in shock and holding branches, a symbolic gesture of respect, with some screaming ‘Baba’ (father), as Odinga was widely known. Indian police said he was walking with his sister, daughter and a personal doctor at an Ayurvedic clinic in Kerala state ‘when he suddenly collapsed’. President William Ruto declared seven days of national mourning and a state funeral, calling Odinga ‘Kenya’s foremost statesman and one of Africa’s greatest sons’. Odinga was at the centre of political developments since the 1990s and remained a dominant force, able to rally huge numbers. ‘How are we going to survive without him? We are shaking,’ Anima Ferrari, his head of protocol, said in tears at Odinga’s residence. Born on January 7, 1945, the son of Kenya’s first vice president, Odinga spent his early political years either in jail or exile, fighting for democracy during the autocratic rule of president Daniel arap Moi. A member of the Luo tribe, he entered parliament in 1992 and ran unsuccessfully for the presidency in 1997, 2007, 2013, 2017 and 2022, claiming to have been cheated of victory in the last four elections. The biggest unrest came after the 2007 election, considered deeply flawed by independent observers, that triggered ethnic violence in which more than 1,100 people died. Odinga was prime minister from 2008 to 2013 in a power-sharing deal aimed at curbing the violence, though the post was later abolished under a new constitution. ‘He is my hero. He has been trying to get proper leadership for this country, but because of malpractices in our elections, he never made it,’ said Ismael Ondego, 42, among the mourners at his residence. His death leaves a leadership vacuum in the opposition, with no obvious successor who can match his ability to mobilise as Kenya heads into a potentially volatile election in 2027. ‘The country loses one of its most influential political players. He had a broad national appeal. None of this can be said of anyone else,’ political analyst Barrack Muluka said. Odinga’s popularity dipped in recent years as ill-health and age weakened his famed speaking abilities. His decision to ally with rivals — then-president Uhuru Kenyatta in 2018 and current president Ruto last year — were unpopular with some supporters and left the country without an effective opposition. Since Odinga almost single-handedly drove the political alliance with Ruto, it is now ‘dead and buried’, Muluka said, leaving Kenyan politics on an uncertain path. ‘It is going to become difficult for William Ruto to get the support that Raila could have rendered him in his strongholds,’ Kaburu Kinoti, who worked on Odinga’s 2022 campaign, said. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi said on X that Odinga was ‘a towering statesman and a cherished friend of India’. A spokesman for the Sreedhareeyam Ayurvedic Eye Hospital and Research Centre in Kerala said Odinga had experienced ‘breathing difficulties and collapsed’. ‘He was provided CPR on the spot and having seen some sign of recovery, he was rushed to the nearest modern hospital. Despite repeated efforts by the medics, his condition deteriorated and the doctors were unable to save him,’ the spokesman said. African Union chair Mahmoud Ali Youssouf posted that he ‘inspired generations of leaders, including myself through his courage, resilience and unwavering belief in the power of dialogue and democratic institutions’.

{"title": "New Age | Madagascar adjusts to military rule after colonel seizes power", "body": "Madagascar braced for a new era of military rule Wednesday, a day after an elite army unit seized power following president Andry Rajoelina’s impeachment and pledged elections in less than two years. The CAPSAT military contingent assumed power Tuesday moments after parliamentarians voted overwhelmingly to impeach Rajoelina, who appeared to have fled the island nation as soldiers joined weeks of street protests at the weekend. The capital Antananarivo was calm early Wednesday but there was some uncertainty about what to expect next with international bodies expressing concern. CAPSAT commander Colonel Michael Randrianirina, the new de facto president of the impoverished country, told reporters Tuesday the transition would take under two years and include the restructuring of major institutions. It would be overseen by a committee of officers from the army, gendarmerie and police. Randrianirina pledged elections in 18 to 24 months and said the committee would seek a ‘consensus prime minister’ to form a new government. The constitutional court validated his authority after accepting the vote against Rajoelina. Randrianirina had long been a vocal critic of Rajoelina’s administration and was reportedly imprisoned for several months from November 2023 for inciting military mutiny with a view to a coup. The presidency denounced ‘a clear act of attempted coup’ and insisted that Rajoelina, whose whereabouts were unknown and who was last seen in public a week ago, ‘remains fully in office’. The United Nations said Tuesday it was waiting for ‘the dust to settle’ but it would be ‘concerned about any unconstitutional change of power’. The security body of regional SADC grouping — of which Rajoelina was holding the rotating presidency — said it was ‘particularly alarmed by reports of an attempted coup d’etat’. ‘The military leaders who have seized power should respect and protect the rights of all Malagasy people,’ the Human Rights Watch said Wednesday. The youth-led movement that initiated the protests on September 25 over lack of water and energy welcomed the intervention of Randrianirina. Rajoelina, re-elected in disputed polls in 2023, came to power in a 2009 military-backed coup that was denounced by the international community which froze foreign aid and investment for nearly four years. He resisted mounting calls to step down, saying in a national address from an unknown location on Monday that he was seeking solutions to Madgascar’s problems. Amid reports that he had been helped to leave with assistance from France, the former colonial power, he said he was in a ‘safe place to protect my life’.

{"title": "New Age | Chaos as security forces fire on mourners for Kenyan politician", "body": "Tens of thousands of mourners in Kenya fled in panic when security forces fired gunshots and teargas in a stadium where they had gathered to see the coffin of Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga, whose body was repatriated from India on Thursday. AFP journalists said at least three people were visibly injured at Kasarani Stadium after security fired to disperse surging crowds trying to break into the VIP section. One showed a serious head wound. Odinga, 80, died of a suspected heart attack at a health clinic in southern India on Wednesday, triggering a huge outpouring of grief across much of Kenya. He was one of Kenya’s foremost statesmen. He ran unsuccessfully for the presidency five times but was seen as a major force for democratic reform. A large crowd initially gathered at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport early on Thursday to greet his coffin, forcing the civil aviation authority to temporarily suspend operations to ‘restore order and ensure safety’. The body was initially due to be taken to parliament, but with supporters swarming and clambering up the gates, the authorities decided to relocate the coffin to Kasarani Stadium on the outskirts of the capital. The main highway to the stadium was then entirely blocked with supporters, becoming a sea of green as many waved symbolic branches for Odinga, affectionately known as ‘Baba’ (father). There were rowdy scenes at the stadium as the crowd awaited the arrival of the coffin, until the outbreak of gunfire led to panicked running. AFP saw several people gathered around a man who was lying motionless on the ground with blood pouring from his head. President William Ruto has announced seven days of national mourning for Odinga, with a state funeral service to be held in Nairobi on Friday. State television showed large numbers of people also gathered in Bondo, the family’s ancestral seat in western Kenya, where Odinga is due to be buried on Sunday. Michael Omondi, a youth leader for Odinga’s party, said he was at the airport ‘to receive an icon... a giant’. ‘Baba, we knew that you were the only person who was going to take us to Canaan (the promised land),’ he added.

{"title": "New Age | Dozens injured at state funeral for Kenya opposition leader Odinga", "body": "Dozens were injured, many seriously, at the state funeral of Kenya’s revered opposition leader Raila Odinga on Friday as crowds rushed to see his coffin, AFP journalists saw. It came a day after at least three people were killed when security forces opened fire to disperse a crowd that had gathered to see Odinga’s body in a separate ceremony. The 80-year-old died from a suspected heart attack at a health clinic in southern India on Wednesday, triggering a huge outpouring of grief for a man known affectionately as ‘Baba’ (father) by many Kenyans. ‘He walked among us as a man but also charged among us as a movement for change, a movement for justice for a better and greater Kenya,’ president William Ruto told the crowd gathered at Nairobi’s Nyayo stadium for the funeral on Friday. Moments later, a surge of mourners trying to reach the coffin on the pitch left dozens injured. AFP journalists saw many had collapsed, some had broken bones or difficulty breathing after being crushed, with at least five ambulances on the pitch to help those hurt. Arguably the most important political figure of his generation in Kenya, Odinga served as prime minister from 2008 to 2013 but never succeeded in winning the presidency despite five attempts. But he outlasted many rivals and is credited as a major player in returning Kenya to multi-party democracy in the 1990s and overseeing the widely praised constitution of 2010. ‘I have freedom of speech because of Raila. I’m here because he is the father,’ said Paul Oloo, a supporter at the funeral. There were also chaotic scenes a day earlier as Odinga’s body was repatriated from India and taken to another stadium on the outskirts of Nairobi to be viewed by supporters. As huge crowds surged towards a VIP gate, security forces opened fire, killing at least three people, according to prominent rights group VOCAL Africa based on information from the city morgue. It was not clear if the security forces fired directly into the crowd or used live rounds. Autopsies are due on Tuesday. AFP met families of the victims at the city morgue on Friday and saw photos of the bodies that appeared to show bullet wounds. ‘He was not disorderly in any way but he was shot,’ said the brother-in-law of one victim, Vincent Otieno Ogutu. Another victim was named as Evans Kiche. The third has yet to be identified. ‘The excessive use of force against mourners is totally unwarranted,’ said Hussein Khalid, head of VOCAL Africa, at the morgue. ‘We are calling on the police to exercise utmost restraint. We don’t want to see more deaths associated with this funeral,’ he added. Odinga’s body will next travel to western Kenya, his family’s home region, where more huge crowds are expected on Saturday, before a private burial service on Sunday. His death leaves a leadership vacuum in the opposition, with no obvious successor as Kenya heads into a potentially volatile election in 2027.

{"title": "New Age | Army colonel sworn in as Madagascar president", "body": "Army colonel Michael Randrianirina was sworn in as Madagascar’s president Friday vowing sweeping reforms, just days after the military took power following weeks of anti-government protests that sent ex-president Andry Rajoelina fleeing. Randrianirina led the CAPSAT army unit, which mutinied and joined the anti-government protesters before announcing Tuesday that the military had taken power, after Rajoelina was impeached for desertion of duty. ‘Today marks a historic turning point for our country,’ Randrianirina said after his swearing-in ceremony, where the 51-year-old colonel swapped his army uniform for a suit. He promised change in the poverty-stricken island nation, where anger over chronic power cuts sparked protests last month that swiftly escalated into a mass movement. ‘We will work hand in hand with all the driving forces of the nation to draft a fine constitution and to agree on new electoral laws for the organisation of elections and referendums,’ Randrianirina said. ‘Our main mission is to thoroughly reform the country’s administrative, socio-economic and political systems of governance,’ he said, promising to consult young people before a new government is formed. He also thanked the youth for spearheading the protests that ousted Rajoelina and said the army had intervened at the request of the top court to ‘avoid anarchy and disorder’. The ceremony in the capital Antananarivo was attended by military officers, politicians, representatives of the Gen Z youth-led protest movement and several foreign delegations, including from the United States, the European Union, Russia and former colonial ruler France. Facing international criticism, Randrianirina has been eager to officialise his new role and insisted the takeover was not a coup, pointing to the constitutional court’s backing. At his swearing-in, the new leader addressed the foreign delegations in French, inviting them to ‘accompany Madagascar in the process of steering and implementing national renewal’. Local media reported that Randrianirina had already met a Russian delegation Thursday. The international community’s ‘large presence here shows that they respect national sovereignty’, he told journalists. The European Union said it was closely monitoring events and called for dialogue to foster a return to democracy in the country. A few dozen people gathered outside the constitutional court Friday in hopes of seeing the new president. ‘We’re happy to be able to hope for change,’ said shopkeeper Faniry Randrianaridoa. ‘We hope, but we’ll see,’ she said. ‘It’s not a whim to want water and electricity.’ Rajoelina’s supporters have condemned the constitutional court’s support of the CAPSAT commander as riddled with procedural illegalities that risked destabilising the country. They insist that Rajoelina remains leader and is working to find solutions to the problems dogging the country. Rajoelina adviser Lova Rinel Rajaoarinelina said Friday there was no possible recourse for the decisions that led to his impeachment. Government forces were accused of a harsh crackdown on the protesters, with many reported dead or wounded, until CAPSAT announced on October 11 that it would refuse orders to shoot on them. It marked a turning point in the uprising, with the unit hailed by the protest movement which now expects a role in the new set-up. Rajoelina’s office confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that he had fled the country, although he has not revealed his whereabouts. Media reports said the 51-year-old was evacuated on Sunday aboard a French military plane that took him to the French island of Reunion, from where he travelled to Dubai. The power grab was the third military transition in Madagascar since independence in 1960, following coups in 1972 and 2009. It is the latest of several former French colonies in Africa to come under military control since 2020, after coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Gabon and Guinea. The country, off Mozambique, is one of the poorest in the world, with about 80 per cent of its 32 million people living in poverty, despite an abundance of natural resources and rich biodiversity. The African Union and regional bloc SADC said they would send fact-finding missions to the country and called for constitutional democracy to be upheld.

{"title": "New Age | I Coast tightens protest ban", "body": "Ivory Coast authorities have imposed a sweeping two-month ban on political rallies and demonstrations just a week before a presidential election, in a move further restricting opposition activity. The ban, announced late Friday by the interior and defence ministries, applies to all political parties and groups except the five candidates officially approved to contest the October 25 vote. It comes amid rising tensions following the exclusion of opposition heavyweights Laurent Gbagbo and Tidjane Thiam from the race. Hundreds of people rallied at protests in Abidjan last weekend, with security forces dispersing crowds. Sporadic unrest, including road and school blockades, has been reported in several regions. Around 700 people have been arrested over the past week, according to public prosecutor Oumar Braman Kone, who said phone data revealed calls for attacks on public institutions which he described as ‘acts of terrorism’. On Thursday, 26 protesters were sentenced to three years in prison for public order offences, and another 105 are due to stand trial next week. The opposition coalition, which includes Gbagbo’s African Peoples’ Party—Ivory Coast and Thiam’s Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, has denounced president Alassane Ouattara’s bid for a fourth term. Amnesty International urged authorities to stop ‘repressing’ protests, but justice minister Sansan Kambile defended the crackdown, citing national security concerns. Ouattara faces four challengers, including former minister Jean-Louis Billon and ex-first lady Simone Gbagbo.

{"title": "New Age | Morocco Gen Z demonstrators demand release of protesters", "body": "Young Moroccans protested Saturday in front of parliament to demand the release of demonstrators arrested in recent weeks as part of Morocco’s Gen Z movement seeking reforms to social services. The movement, which had taken the usually stable kingdom by surprise in late September, appeared to be losing momentum as fewer demonstrators have taken to the street. Some 600 people, including minors, are currently detained pending trial on suspicion of joining the movement, said the Moroccan Association for Human Rights. ‘Detainees, stay strong, we’ll keep fighting,’ demonstrators chanted on Saturday in Rabat. Though a long-awaited speech by King Mohammed VI last week did not make mention of the movement, the monarch urged his government to improve public education and healthcare — the movement’s initial demands. ‘The king didn’t say anything about the movement, which disappointed a lot of people,’ said one demonstrator. ‘But we remain mobilised.’ Since September 27, the GenZ 212 collective — an online-based group who called for the protests and whose organisers remain unknown — has led near-daily protests until last week in the North African country. Their demands later expanded to include an end to corruption and a change of government. The protest came after the deaths of eight pregnant women during Caesarean sections at a hospital in Agadir. Hundreds were arrested during the early days of the largely peaceful but prohibited demonstrations. Some cities had seen spates of violence and acts of vandalism, while authorities have said three people were killed by police acting in ‘self-defence’ during clashes in a village near Agadir. One protester arrested a day before the protests erupted was sentenced to five years in prison earlier this week for ‘incitement to commit a crime’ after he made calls to join the protest, lawyer Mohamed Nouini said on Saturday. Nouini on Friday said a student was sentenced to one year in prison after his arrest during one of the rallies. Following the king’s address, the collective called for ‘peaceful sit-ins’.

{"title": "New Age | Drone attack hits Khartoum airport area ahead of reopening", "body": "A drone attack struck the vicinity of Khartoum International Airport early Tuesday, witnesses said, one day before the army-backed government was due to reopen the facility for domestic flights for the first time in over two years. The airport has been shut since fighting erupted in April 2023 between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, leaving vital infrastructure across the capital heavily damaged. Witnesses said they heard the sounds of drones in central and southern Khartoum and sounds of explosions in the airport area from 4:00am until 6:00am local time (0200-0400 GMT). One eyewitness in the Al-Azhari neighbourhood in southern Khartoum said he ‘heard the sound of an explosion and then a drone passed overhead’. A resident in central Khartoum said he was woken ‘at 4 am to the sound of drones in the sky. Shortly after, we heard loud explosions in the direction of the airport’. On Monday, Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority had said the airport would reopen on Wednesday, with domestic flights resuming gradually after technical and operational preparations were completed. Khartoum has remained relatively calm since the army reclaimed control earlier this year but drone attacks have continued, with the RSF repeatedly accused of targeting military and civilian infrastructure. Another eyewitness also said that ‘drones bombed northern Omdurman’, part of greater Khartoum, early Tuesday, an area known to host some of Sudan’s largest military installations. ‘I saw three drones heading north towards Wadi Sayedna (military) base and I heard the sound of explosions,’ they said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the strikes and no information on casualties or damage was released. Tuesday’s strike marks the third drone attack on the capital in a week. Last week, drones targeted Khartoum on two consecutive days, including strikes on two army bases in the city’s northwest. A military official said most of the drones were intercepted. Following the army’s counteroffensive and recapture of Khartoum, more than 8,00,000 people have returned to the capital. The army-aligned government has since launched a wide-ranging reconstruction campaign and is moving officials back from the Red Sea city of Port Sudan, where they had operated during the conflict. Large parts of Khartoum, however, remain in ruins, with millions still experiencing frequent blackouts linked to RSF drone activity. The most intense violence meanwhile is now concentrated in the west, where RSF forces have surrounded El-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur not under their control. The paramilitary force has tried to seize the city for over 18 months, making it the most strategically critical front of the war. The UN warned on Monday of escalating violence in North and West Darfur, with drone strikes and ground clashes reported across both regions. The wider war in Sudan has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 12 million and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises.

{"title": "New Age | Paramilitary drones target Khartoum airport for 2nd consecutive day", "body": "Paramilitary drones targeted Khartoum International Airport on Wednesday for a second consecutive day, a Sudanese military source said. The source, who spoke anonymously because he was not authorised to brief the media, said ‘drones targeted Khartoum airport once again at dawn’ on Wednesday. He added that army air defences intercepted the drones he said had been launched by a ‘terrorist militia’ — a reference to the Rapid Support Forces, which have been fighting the army since April 2023. Sudan’s Civil Aviation Authority had said the airport would reopen on Wednesday, with domestic flights resuming gradually after technical and operational preparations were completed. But no further announcements on the reopening were made after Tuesday’s attack and it remains unclear whether operations will go ahead as planned following the latest strikes. On Tuesday, witnesses reported hearing numerous explosions in an area near the airport in the early morning. The facility appeared intact during a visit later that day by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. Speaking from inside the airport, Burhan said the army was ‘determined to crush this rebellion’ — a reference to the RSF led by his former ally Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. The RSF has not claimed responsibility for the attacks, but has been repeatedly accused of using drones to target military and civilian infrastructure in recent months. In a speech released late on Tuesday on social media, Daglo asserted the RSF ‘attacks military positions only’ and vowed to remove the army, which he called a ‘cancer’. Khartoum has seen a relative lull in ground fighting since the army retook parts of the capital earlier this year, but drone strikes have continued amid on-going efforts by the government to restore services and relocate key institutions back from the de facto capital of Port Sudan on the Red Sea. More than one million people have returned to the capital within the last ten months, according to the UN’s migration agency. Large parts of Khartoum, however, remain in ruins, with millions still experiencing frequent blackouts linked to RSF drone activity. The most intense violence meanwhile is now concentrated in the west, where RSF forces have surrounded El-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur not under their control. The paramilitary force has tried to seize the city for over 18 months. The UN warned on Monday of escalating violence in North and West Darfur states as well as the Kordofan region and Blue Nile state in the south with drone strikes and ground clashes reported across the regions. In Blue Nile State late on Tuesday, the army said its air defences intercepted drones that targeted power stations in the city of Roseis. Despite repeated international efforts to broker a ceasefire, both sides have shown little willingness to compromise. ‘We do not want any mercenary or militia to have a role in Sudan’s future,’ Burhan said on Tuesday, referring to the RSF. Last month, Sudan’s army-aligned government pushed back on a new peace proposal put forward by the US, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. The plan had hinted at the current government and the RSF’s exclusion from the country’s post-war political transition. The countries — often referred to as the quad — jointly called for a humanitarian truce in Sudan, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a transition toward civilian rule. The broader conflict has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 12 million people, and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises.

{"title": "New Age | Morocco to prosecute 1,500 over GenZ protests", "body": "More than 1,500 people are facing prosecution in Morocco over recent GenZ 212 protests demanding better public education and health care, a local NGO said Friday. About a thousand of the suspects are currently in custody, and 240 have already been sentenced by a court in Agadir, in the south—39 of them to prison terms of between six and 15 years—according to Souad Brahma, president of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights. Hundreds more have been handed sentences ranging from three months to a year by other courts, she said. The main charges include organising unauthorised protests, possession of bladed weapons, property damage, and insults or violence against security forces, said Brahma, who urged authorities “to guarantee fair trials for all those being prosecuted”. She also called for “impartial investigations into [rights] violations that took place during the protests”. Starting late last month, the online GenZ 212 collective organised a series of demonstrations seeking reforms in the health and education sectors, as well as “an end to corruption”. In the initial days of the protests, when the gatherings were banned, police made hundreds of arrests. Two nights were marked by violence, including in Agadir, where three people were killed in clashes, though organisers insisted on their commitment to nonviolent protest. They have called for fresh “peaceful” protests on Saturday and Sunday. For two weeks, the demonstrations were held on a near-daily basis, but they have gradually waned in both frequency and turnout, particularly after a speech by Morocco’s king calling for social reforms and the announcement of a draft budget laying out improvements to health and education. Social inequalities have been a major challenge in Morocco, where deep regional disparities persist alongside a gap between the public and private sectors.

{"title": "New Age | Ouattara set for 4th term as Ivory Coast president", "body": "Ivorians voted Saturday to pick a new president, with incumbent Alassane Ouatarra a shoo-in for a controversial fourth term, pitted against a divided opposition further hobbled by the barring of two leading candidates. Ouattara, 83, has wielded power in the world’s top cocoa producer since 2011, when the country began reasserting itself as a west African economic powerhouse. Nearly nine million Ivorians are eligible to vote in the polls, which close at 6:00pm, choosing between five contenders. Turnout will be a key factor. Polling stations in the economic capital Abidjan visited by AFP in the afternoon were not crowded but there were many more voters in the second city Bouake, a Ouattara stronghold. Roads were cut off in some parts of the country’s south and west but no disturbances were reported at polling stations. Many voting centres in pro-opposition areas were nearly empty, AFP reporters said. Ouattara’s leading rivals—former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo and Credit Suisse ex-CEO Tidjane Thiam—have been barred from standing, Gbagbo for a criminal conviction and Thiam for acquiring French nationality. With the opposition calling for protests and unrest turning deadly in recent days, the government has slapped a night-time curfew in some areas and deployed 44,000 security forces. ‘We are voting today in peace. Our hope is for the day to pass without incident,’ said Severine Kouakou, a 46-year-old voter in Bouake. ‘It is hard to imagine any surprise at the end of this election... since opposition heavyweights aren’t present,’ Gilles Yabi of think tank Wathi told AFP. Four people, including one policeman, have died in political unrest in recent weeks, while on Monday, an independent electoral commission building was torched. The government has responded by banning demonstrations, and the judiciary has sentenced several dozen people to three years in prison for disturbing the peace. The security forces were deployed across the country of 30 million to keep protests in check, especially in former opposition fiefdoms in the south and west. A night-time curfew was in place on Friday and Saturday in the Yamoussoukro region, where the political capital is located. Authorities say they want to avoid ‘chaos’ and a repeat of unrest surrounding the 2020 presidential election, in which 85 people died. ‘I ask you to closely monitor your neighbourhoods.... We must be ready to protect Ivory Coast,’ Ouattara said during his final rally on Thursday. After being re-elected in 2015 with 83 per cent of the vote, Ouattara had promised not to run again given the two-term presidential limit. But when his chosen successor, Amadou Gon Coulibaly, died suddenly, Ouattara changed his mind, buoyed by a revision of the constitution which he argued reset his number of terms to zero. On Wednesday, barred former president Gbagbo condemned the poll as a ‘civilian coup d’etat’ and ‘electoral robbery’. ‘Those who could have won have been eliminated. I do not accept this,’ he said. None of the four rival candidates represents an established party, nor do they have the reach of Ouattara’s RHDP. Former trade minister and agri-businessman Jean-Louis Billon, 60, hopes to rally backers from his former stable, the Democratic Party. Former first lady Simone Ehivet Gbagbo, 76, is looking to garner votes from supporters of her ex-husband. The left-wing vote hangs in the balance between Simone Gbagbo and Ahoua Don Mello, a civil engineer and independent Pan-African with Russian sympathies. Then there is centrist Henriette Lagou, a moderate who also stood in the 2015 presidential poll, garnering less than one per cent. Ouattara came to power following the 2010-2011 presidential clash between him and Gbagbo, which cost more than 3,000 lives among their supporters. Ouattara’s government touts several years of strong economic growth and general security, despite jihadist threats on Ivory Coast’s borders, as its achievements. But critics say the undisputed growth has only benefitted a small portion of the population and has been accompanied by a spiralling cost of living.

{"title": "New Age | Four killed in Cameroon opposition protests", "body": "Four people were killed in clashes between security forces and supporters of a Cameroon opposition leader who claims to have won recent presidential elections, authorities said ahead of the announcement of official results Monday. Issa Tchiroma, who challenged president Paul Biya’s 43-year grip on power in the October 12 ballot, had called on his supporters to march peacefully on the eve of the announcement, despite a ban on public gatherings. Tchiroma says he won 54.8 per cent of the vote, but most analysts expect the 92-year-old Biya to win an eighth term in a system his critics say has been increasingly rigged. In Cameroon’s largest city Douala, the regional governor said demonstrators ‘attacked’ a gendarmerie brigade and police stations in two districts on Sunday. ‘Four people unfortunately lost their lives,’ said Samuel Dieudonne Ivaha Diboua, adding that several members of the security forces were also injured. Protesters at the scene showed AFP journalists bullet casings they said they collected after security forces fired shots near the gendarmerie. The shooting with ‘live ammunition’ began after a volley of tear gas, a demonstrator said. ‘They fired, three people, three bodies fell in front of us,’ he said. The Constitutional Council is due to announce the final election results at 11:00am (1000 GMT) Monday in the capital Yaounde. Earlier Sunday, police had fired teargas to disperse hundreds of people in Tchiroma’s northern stronghold of Garoua, where activists carried Cameroonian flags and banners reading ‘Tchiroma 2025’ and chanted ‘Goodbye Paul Biya, Tchiroma is coming’. For several days, dozens of supporters have gathered around the home of the opposition leader, who claimed in a video Sunday that military personnel had tried to take him away. In Yaounde, the call to protest did not seem to have been followed amid a heavy police presence. But in Douala, prior to the reported clashes, an AFP journalist observed several dozen people gathered near the airport, defying the ban on demonstrations ordered by the department’s prefect. On Friday, two opposition figures from a coalition that had endorsed Tchiroma as a candidate were arrested in their homes in Douala, the coalition said. They are Djeukam Tchameni, president of the Movement for Democracy and Interdependence in Cameroon, and Anicet Ekane, president of the African Movement for the New Independence of Cameroon. Significant disruptions to internet access have also been reported in recent days, which according to monitor NetBlocks ‘may limit coverage of events on the ground’. Minister of Territorial Administration Paul Atanga Nji said on Saturday the protests ‘create the conditions for a security crisis’ and contribute to ‘the implementation of an insurrectionist project’.

{"title": "New Age | Fears for trapped civilians in Sudan’s El-Fasher after RSF claims control", "body": "Thousands of civilians remained trapped in Sudan’s stricken city of El-Fasher, with fears growing for their safety, the United Nations and local groups said on Monday, after paramilitary forces claimed control of the army’s last stronghold in the western Darfur region. Since May 2024, El-Fasher has been besieged by the Rapid Support Forces, who have been fighting a brutal war with Sudan’s army for over two years. Footage shared by pro-democracy activists on Monday purportedly showed dozens of people lying dead on the ground alongside burned-out vehicles. AFP was unable to contact civilians in the city, where the Sudanese Journalists’ Syndicate says communications, including satellite networks, have been cut off by a media blackout. The syndicate expressed ‘deep concern for the safety of journalists’ in El-Fasher, adding that independent reporter Muammar Ibrahim has been detained by RSF forces since Sunday. The RSF said on Sunday they had seized control of the city, but the army and its allies did not respond to requests for comment. If confirmed, the city’s capture would mark a significant turning point in Sudan’s war, which has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million people since April 2023. It would give the RSF control over all five state capitals in Darfur, consolidating its parallel administration in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur. Such a shift could potentially partition Sudan, with the army holding the north, east and centre, and the RSF dominating Darfur and parts of the south. ‘This represents a terrible escalation in the conflict,’ UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said in answer to an AFP question on Monday, adding that ‘the level of suffering that we are witnessing in Sudan is unbearable’. Around 2,60,000 civilians, half of them children, remain trapped in El-Fasher without aid, where many have resorted to eating animal fodder. Despite RSF assurances of civilian protection, the local resistance committee accused the paramilitaries of committing atrocities, saying that since Sunday, innocent civilians had suffered ‘the worst forms of violence and ethnic cleansing.’ A video circulated by the RSF appeared to show fighters detaining dozens of men in civilian clothing accusing them of supporting the army and the Joint Forces. Fighting, pro-democracy activists said on Sunday night, continued ‘in the vicinity of El-Fasher airport and several areas west of the city,’ with a ‘complete absence of air support’, citing failures by the army and its allies to protect residents. The army-aligned governor of Darfur called on Monday for the protection of civilians in El-Fasher and demanded ‘an independent investigation into the violations and massacres carried out by the militia away from public view.’ The UN last month voiced alarm over potential massacres targeting non-Arab communities in El-Fasher, similar to those reported after the RSF captured the nearby Zamzam camp in April. The United Nations’s migration agency said 2,500 to 3,000 people fled El-Fasher on Sunday, seeking safety within the city or westward to Tawila and Mellit towns. Sudan’s de facto leader, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, appeared publicly on Sunday night but only for a meeting with the Turkish ambassador in Port Sudan. The army-led Transitional Sovereignty Council said they discussed the ‘siege imposed by the terrorist Rapid Support militia on El-Fasher.’ Tom Fletcher, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, called for safe passage for civilians trapped in the fighting. Access to the city remains severely restricted due to ongoing combat. Since August, the RSF have intensified artillery and drone attacks on El-Fasher, gradually eroding the army’s last defensive positions. Despite repeated international appeals for a ceasefire, with both the RSF and the army accused of committing atrocities, neither side has shown willingness to compromise. Representatives from the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates met in Washington on Friday to plot a path towards ‘peace and stability in Sudan’ and a transition to civilian rule, according to a statement by US senior advisor for Africa Massad Boulos. But the meeting appeared not to yield any tangible progress. ‘It is clear that it is not only a Sudanese problem, with the army and Rapid Support Forces fighting each other,’ Guterres said. ‘We have more and more an external interference that undermines the possibility to a ceasefire and to a political solution.’ The United Arab Emirates has long been accused of supplying advanced weaponry and drones to the RSF — allegations it denies. Egypt, which shares a border with Sudan, has been a key ally of the army. Now well into its third year, the war has spiralled into what the United Nations describes as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis.

{"title": "New Age | EU denounces ‘brutality’ of RSF forces in Sudan", "body": "The European Union on Wednesday denounced what it said was the ‘brutality’ of Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, which recently captured the key city of El-Fasher. The statement came as reports emerged of mass atrocities there and the killing of five Red Crescent volunteers in Kordofan. ‘Civilians being targeted based on their ethnicity underscore the brutality of the Rapid Support Force,’ said a statement by the EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas. ‘The Rapid Support Forces bear responsibility for protecting civilians in areas under their control, including aid workers, local responders, and journalists,’ said the statement, co-signed by the EU’s commissioner for crisis management, Hadja Lahbib. ‘Humanitarian organisations must be granted immediate, safe and unconditional access to all those in need. Civilians wishing to leave the city must be allowed to do so safely.’ After an 18-month siege marked by starvation and bombardment, the city is now under the control of the Rapid Support Forces — descendants of the Janjaweed militias accused of genocide two decades ago. The paramilitary group, locked in a brutal war with the army since April 2023, launched a final assault on the city in recent days, seizing the army’s last positions. In the neighbouring region of North Kordofan, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent said five Sudanese Red Crescent volunteers had been killed in Bara on Monday, and that three others were missing after the RSF took control of the town on Saturday.

{"title": "New Age | 700 killed in Tanzania post-election violence", "body": "Around 700 people have been killed in three days of election protests in Tanzania, the main opposition party said Friday, with protesters still on the streets in the midst of an internet blackout. President Samia Suluhu Hassan, whose government is accused of a campaign of repression, had sought to cement her position and silence critics in her party in the virtually uncontested polls, with the main challengers either jailed or barred from standing. Wednesday’s election descended into chaos as huge crowds took to the streets of Dar es Salaam and other cities, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew. With foreign journalists largely banned from covering the election and a communications block entering its third day, information from the ground has been scarce. But the main opposition party, Chadema, which was barred from the election, said protesters were marching on the city centre in Dar es Salaam on Friday, met by a heavy police and army presence. ‘As we speak the figure for deaths in Dar es Salaam is around 350 and for Mwanza it is 200-plus. Added to figures from other places around the country, the overall figure is around 700,’ Chadema spokesman John Kitoka said. ‘The death toll could be much higher,’ he warned, saying killings could be happening during the night-time curfew. A security source said they were hearing reports of more than 500 dead, ‘maybe 700-800 in the whole country’, while Amnesty said it had received information of at least 100. Multiple hospitals and health clinics were too afraid to talk directly to AFP. Local news sites had not been updated since Wednesday, and Hassan has not commented on the unrest. The only official statement came from army chief Jacob Mkunda late Thursday who called the protesters ‘criminals’. In Zanzibar, a tourist hotspot, Hassan’s ruling party had already been declared winner of the local vote on Thursday. The opposition party, ACT-Wazalendo, rejected the result, saying: ‘They have robbed the people of Zanzibar of their voice. The only solution to deliver justice is through a fresh election.’ A senior party official said that ballot boxes had been stuffed, people allowed to vote multiple times without ID and their election observers kicked out of counting rooms. The ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi: CCM, was due to give a press conference later in the day. At a meeting place for opposition supporters on Zanzibar, there was dismay and fear. ‘There has never been a credible election since 1995,’ said a 70-year-old man, referring to Tanzania’s first multi-party vote. None of those interviewed gave their names. ‘We are afraid of speaking because they might come to our houses and pick us up,’ said one. Hassan has faced opposition from parts of the army and allies of her iron-fisted predecessor, John Magufuli, since she took over upon his death in 2021, analysts say. They said she wanted an emphatic victory to cement her position, and the authorities banned the main opposition party, Chadema, and put its leader on trial for treason. In the run-up to the vote, rights groups condemned a ‘wave of terror’ in the east African nation, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days. Much public anger has been directed at Hassan’s son, Abdul Halim Hafidh Ameir, accused of overseeing the crackdown. ACT-Wazalendo was allowed to contest the local election in Zanzibar, but its candidate was barred from competing against Hassan on the mainland.

{"title": "New Age | US, UK withdraw non-essential embassy staff from Mali", "body": "The United States and United Kingdom are withdrawing non-essential staff from their embassies in Mali, where a fuel blockade waged by jihadists has upturned daily life. Since back-to-back coups in 2020 and 2021, Mali has been ruled by a military junta that is struggling to counter various armed groups, particularly the al-Qaeda-linked Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims, which is carrying out the blockade. JNIM has targeted fuel tankers, particularly those coming from Senegal and Ivory Coast, through which the majority of Mali’s imported goods transit, since September. The US State Department on Thursday ordered the American embassy’s ‘non-emergency employees and their family members to leave Mali due to safety risks’. The move came two days after the US embassy urged all citizens in the country to ‘depart immediately’ on commercial aircraft. The British foreign office also on Thursday said that ‘non-essential British Embassy staff have been temporarily withdrawn from Bamako’. It additionally warned its citizens to ‘leave immediately by commercial flight if you judge it safe to do so’. Italy, Germany, Canada and a handful of other countries have also told their nationals to leave Mali as swiftly as possible. JNIM has recently appeared to be seeking to isolate Bamako by increasing operations on the surrounding roads. Many tankers have been set on fire, while drivers and soldiers have been killed or kidnapped in jihadist ambushes. The blockade has hit the capital particularly hard the past two weeks, with the landlocked Sahel nation’s economy grinding to a halt.

{"title": "New Age | RSF capture of El-Fasher sparks ‘grave danger’ fears", "body": "Thousands of civilians are feared trapped and in imminent danger in the Sudanese city of El-Fasher after its fall to paramilitaries, Doctors Without Borders said Saturday, as Germany’s top diplomat described the situation there as ‘apocalyptic’. At war with the regular army since April 2023, the Rapid Support Forces seized El-Fasher on Sunday, pushing the military out of its last stronghold in Darfur after a grinding 18-month siege marked by starvation and bombardment. Since the city’s fall, reports have emerged of summary executions, sexual violence, attacks on aid workers, looting and abductions, while communications remain largely cut off. Survivors from El-Fasher who reached the nearby town of Tawila have told AFP of mass killings, children shot before their parents, and civilians beaten and robbed as they fled. The UN says more than 65,000 people have fled El-Fasher since Sunday but tens of thousands remain trapped. Around 260,000 people were in the city before the RSF’s final assault. ‘Large numbers of people remain in grave danger and are being prevented by the Rapid Support Forces and its allies from reaching safer areas,’ Doctors Without Borders said. The NGO added that only 5,000 people had managed to make their way to Tawila, about 70 kilometres to the west. The numbers of people arriving in Tawila ‘don’t add up, while accounts of large-scale atrocities are mounting’, said MSF head of emergencies Michel Olivier Lacharite. ‘Where are all the missing people who have already survived months of famine and violence in El-Fasher?’ he added. ‘The most likely, albeit frightening, answer is that they are being killed, blocked, and hunted down when trying to flee.’ Several eyewitnesses told MSF that a group of 500 civilians, along with soldiers from the military and the army-allied Joint Forces, had attempted to flee on Sunday, but most were killed or captured by the RSF and their allies. Survivors reported that people were separated based on their gender, age or presumed ethnicity, and that many were still being held for ransom. Hayat, a mother of five who fled the city, previously told AFP that ‘young men travelling with us were stopped’ along the way by paramilitaries and ‘we don’t know what happened to them’. The UN said Friday the death toll from the RSF’s assault on the city may be in the hundreds, while army allies accused the paramilitary group of killing over 2,000 civilians. Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab suggested on Friday that mass killings were likely continuing in and around El-Fasher. The lab, which uses satellite imagery and open-source information to document human rights abuses during wars, said fresh images from Friday showed ‘no large-scale movement’ of civilians fleeing the city, giving them reason to believe much of the population may be ‘dead, captured, or in hiding’. The lab identified at least 31 clusters of objects consistent with human bodies between Sunday and Friday, across neighbourhoods, university grounds and military sites. ‘Indicators that mass killing is continuing are clearly visible,’ the lab said. At a conference in Bahrain on Saturday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Sudan was ‘absolutely an apocalyptic situation, the greatest humanitarian crisis of the world’. He added that the RSF had ‘pledged to protect civilians and they will be held accountable for these actions’. Speaking at the same event, British foreign minister Yvette Cooper also described the reported abuses as ‘truly horrifying’. ‘Atrocities, mass executions, starvation and the devastating use of rape as a weapon of war, with women and children bearing the brunt of the largest humanitarian crisis in the 21st century,’ she said. The RSF said Thursday that it had arrested several fighters accused of abuses during the capture of El-Fasher, but UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher questioned the group’s commitment to investigating atrocities. Both the RSF—descended from the Janjaweed militias accused of genocide in Darfur two decades ago—and the army have faced war crimes accusations over the course of the conflict. The US has previously determined the RSF committed genocide in Darfur. The RSF has received weapons and drones from the UAE, according to UN reports, though Abu Dhabi has denied giving any support to the paramilitary group. Meanwhile, the army has drawn on support from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. El-Fasher’s capture gives the RSF full control over all five state capitals in Darfur, effectively splitting Sudan along an east-west axis, with the army controlling the north, east and centre. UN officials have warned that the violence is now spreading to the neighbouring Kordofan region, with reports emerging of ‘large-scale atrocities perpetrated’ by the RSF. The wider conflict has killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 12 million and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises.

The electoral commission said Hassan won 97.66 per cent of the vote and turnout was at 87 per cent, despite reports from AFP journalists and other observers that polling stations were largely empty early Wednesday before election day descended into violent protests. ‘The government strongly condemns the violent incidents. These incidents were not patriotic at all,’ said Hassan as she accepted a winner’s certificate on state television. Hassan, 65, had sought to cement her position and silence critics in her party with an emphatic victory in which the main opposition candidates were either jailed or barred from the election. But a heavy crackdown and the lack of alternative candidates sparked mass protests around the country. The main opposition party, Chadema, told AFP ‘no less than 800 people’ have been killed by security forces since Wednesday—claims that could not be independently verified. A security source and diplomat in Dar es Salaam both told AFP that deaths were ‘in the hundreds’, but verifying information is difficult as an internet blackout remained in place on Saturday. The election result is a ‘mockery of the democratic process’, Chadema spokesman John Kitoka told AFP, calling for a ‘fresh election’. ‘We are going to announce our reaction that could also include calling for national protests,’ he added. Tourists have been stranded by cancelled flights, and the main port at Dar es Salaam—a major economic lifeline for the country—was shuttered, according to data from tracker Vessel Finder and Dutch shipping firm C Steinweg. There were reports Saturday of spiking food prices as shops ran low on supplies, petrol stations were closed and public transport halted. ‘I have been staying in the mosque since Wednesday when the violence erupted,’ Mohamed Rajab, a 52-year-old in Dar es Salaam, told AFP. ‘There is no transport. I’m not sure when I’m going back home.’ Hassan was elevated from vice-president on the sudden death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, in 2021. Rights groups say she oversaw a ‘wave of terror’ in the east African nation ahead of the vote, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days. Chadema was barred from taking part in the election and its leader put on trial for treason. Despite a heavy security presence, election day descended into chaos as crowds took to the streets across the country, tearing down her posters and attacking police and polling stations, leading to an internet shutdown and curfew. Hassan’s government denies using ‘excessive force’. But UN chief Antonio Guterres was ‘deeply concerned’ about the situation in Tanzania, ‘including reports of deaths and injuries during the demonstrations’, according to his spokesman. Much public anger has been directed at Hassan’s son, Abdul Halim Hafidh Ameir, accused of overseeing the pre-election crackdown. There have been unconfirmed reports of the army siding with protesters in some places, but army chief Jacob Mkunda came out strongly on Hassan’s side on Thursday, calling the protesters ‘criminals’. Foreign minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said Friday that his government had ‘no figures’ on any dead. ‘Currently, no excessive force has been used,’ he said in an interview with Al Jazeera. ‘There’s no number until now of any protesters killed.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/280856/tanzania-president-wins-in-landslide-amid-crackdown-claims", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 591}
{"title": "New Age | UN backs Morocco plan for W Sahara autonomy", "body": "The UN Security Council voted Friday in favour of a resolution backing Morocco’s autonomy plan for Western Sahara as the ‘most feasible’ solution for the disputed territory, triggering celebrations in Rabat but angering Algeria. Western Sahara is a vast mineral-rich former Spanish colony that is largely controlled by Morocco but has been claimed for decades by the pro-independence Polisario Front, which is supported by Algeria. The council had previously urged Morocco, the Polisario Front, Algeria and Mauritania to resume talks to reach a broad agreement. But, at the initiative of US president Donald Trump’s administration, the council shifted to support a plan, initially presented by Rabat in 2007, in which Western Sahara would enjoy autonomy under Morocco’s sole sovereignty. The resolution, adopted by an 11-0 vote with three abstentions and Algeria refusing to participate, said autonomy for Western Sahara under Moroccan sovereignty may be the basis for future negotiations to resolve the 50-year-old conflict. ‘Genuine autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty could constitute a most feasible solution,’ the UNSC resolution said. Morocco’s King Mohammed VI lauded the vote as ‘historic,’ saying ‘we are opening a new and victorious chapter in the process of enshrining the Moroccan character of the Sahara.’ In the Moroccan capital Rabat, thousands of people danced and sang to celebrate the vote. ‘The Sahara is Moroccan and always has been!’ chanted the joyful crowds, alternating the rhythm with the national anthem and other patriotic songs. In Smara, a city in the disputed territory, residents set off fireworks as soon as the vote was announced. Trump, during his first term in office, in 2020 recognized Morocco’s claim to Western Sahara after Morocco normalized relations with Israel—achieving top diplomatic objectives for both Rabat and Washington. Spain, France, Britain and Germany have since expressed support for Morocco’s sovereignty over the territory. Trump, who has set his sights on receiving a Nobel Peace Prize, often boasts about his ability to help end conflicts around the world, claiming key roles in Gaza, Kashmir and several other hotspots in recent months. The United Nations envoy on Western Sahara, Staffan de Mistura, has welcomed US efforts to solve the issue but raised concerns about a lack of detail in Morocco’s plan. Algerian ambassador Amar Bendjama said the text ‘does not faithfully or sufficiently reflect the UN doctrine on decolonisation.’ It ‘fell short of the expectations and legitimate aspirations of the people of Western Sahara, represented by the Polisario Front [who] have been resisting for over 50 years to have, as the sole party, a say in their own destiny,’ he added. The resolution adopted Friday calls on UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres and de Mistura to conduct negotiations on the basis of the plan to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. It also extends the UN peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara for another year.

{"title": "New Age | Thousands flee as Sudan conflict spreads east from Darfur", "body": "Over 36,000 Sudanese civilians have fled towns and villages in the Kordofan region east of Darfur, the United Nations said, just over a week after paramilitary forces overran the city of El-Fasher. In recent weeks, the central Kordofan region — a strategic hinge between Sudan’s Darfur provinces and the Khartoum-Riverine heartland to the east — has become the latest battleground between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, locked in a brutal conflict since April 2023. An estimated 36,825 people have fled five localities in North Kordofan between October 26 and 31, the UN’s migration agency said in a statement late Sunday. Residents on Monday reported a heavy surge in both RSF and army presence across towns and villages in North Kordofan. Both the army and RSF forces are vying for El-Obeid, the North Kordofan state capital and a key logistics and command hub that links Darfur to Khartoum, and also hosts an airport. ‘Today, all our forces have converged on the Bara front here,’ an RSF member said in a video shared by the RSF late on Sunday, referring to a city north of El-Obeid. The RSF claimed control of Bara last week. Suleiman Babiker, who lives in Um Smeima, west of El-Obeid, said that following the paramilitary capture of El-Fasher, ‘the number of RSF vehicles increased’. ‘We stopped going to our farms, afraid of clashes,’ he said. Another local resident, requesting anonymity for security reasons, also said ‘there has been a big increase in army vehicles and weapons west and south of El-Obeid’ over the past two weeks. Martha Pobee, assistant UN secretary-general for Africa, raised the alarm last week about ‘large-scale atrocities’ and ‘ethnically motivated reprisals’ by the RSF in Bara. She warned of patterns echoing those in Darfur, where RSF fighters have been accused of mass killings, sexual violence and abductions against non-Arab communities after El-Fasher’s fall. The conflict has already killed tens of thousands, displaced nearly 12 million and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises.

{"title": "New Age | Tanzania president sworn in as opposition says hundreds killed in protests", "body": "Tanzanian president Samia Suluhu Hassan played down days of bloody protest as she was inaugurated on Monday, with an internet blackout still in place as the opposition says hundreds were killed. The electoral commission said Hassan won 98 per cent of the vote. The main opposition party, Chadema, which was barred from running, has rejected the results. It has called for fresh elections, saying last Wednesday’s vote was a ‘sham’. In her speech, Hassan called for ‘unity and solidarity’ but also alleged that some of the young protesters came from ‘outside Tanzania’. ‘Our defence and security agencies continue to investigate and examine in detail what happened,’ she said, promising a return to normalcy as she addressed officials and foreign dignitaries in the capital Dodoma. The ceremony was held in State House without the public, rather than a stadium is usually the case. A total internet blackout has been in place since protests broke out on election day, meaning only a trickle of verifiable information has been getting out of the east African country. A diplomatic source said there were credible reports of hundreds — perhaps even thousands — of deaths registered at hospitals and health clinics around Tanzania. Chadema said it had recorded ‘no less than 800’ deaths by Saturday, but none of the figures could be independently verified. The government has not commented on any deaths, except to reject accusations that ‘excessive force’ was used. Schools and colleges remained closed on Monday, with public transport halted and reports of some church services not taking place on Sunday. The diplomatic source said there were ‘concerning reports’ that police were using the internet blackout to buy time as they ‘hunt down opposition members and protesters who might have videos’ of atrocities committed last week. Dar es Salaam and other cities were much calmer over the weekend as a near-total lockdown was in place, but prices were soaring for basic goods. An AFP reporter said police were stopping almost everyone who moved around the city, checking IDs and bags, and allowing shops to open only in the afternoon. AFP journalists on the island of Zanzibar, which has greater political freedom and had few protests, saw masked armed men patrolling without visible insignia or identification in the days after the election. A rights group in neighbouring Kenya presented footage on Sunday that it said was gathered from inside Tanzania, including images of dead bodies piled up in the street. The images could not be independently verified. Pope Leo XIV on Sunday called for prayers for Tanzania where he said post-election violence had erupted ‘with numerous victims’. ‘I urge everyone to avoid all forms of violence and to pursue the path of dialogue,’ the pope said. Hassan was elevated from vice-president on the sudden death of her predecessor, John Magufuli, in 2021 and wanted an emphatic victory to cement her place and silence critics within the ruling party, analysts say. Rights groups described a ‘wave of terror’ ahead of the vote, including a string of high-profile abductions that escalated in the final days. Despite a heavy security presence, election day descended into chaos as large crowds tore down Hassan’s posters and attacked police and polling stations. Polling stations had been largely empty before the violence broke out, AFP journalists and observers saw, though the electoral commission later claimed turnout was 87 per cent. ‘In some polling stations, they (police) were more than the number of voters,’ an initial report by Southern African Development Community observers said Monday. They emphasised censorship and exclusion of the opposition ahead of the vote and said their ‘tentative conclusion’ was that Tanzanians ‘could not express their democratic will’.

{"title": "New Age | Christian, Muslim Nigerians push back on threatened US strikes", "body": "Nigerians across the religious spectrum pushed back Monday on US president Donald Trump’s threats of military intervention over the killing of Christians in the country. Africa’s most populous country, which is roughly evenly split between a mostly Christian south and Muslim-majority north, is home to myriad conflicts, which experts say kill both Christians and Muslims, often without distinction. But claims of Christian ‘persecution’ in Nigeria have found traction online among the US and European right in recent weeks. ‘Christians are being killed, we can’t deny the fact that Muslims are also being killed,’ Danjuma Dickson Auta, a Christian and community leader, said. Trump said on social media over the weekend that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack. Asked by an AFP reporter aboard Air Force One if he was considering putting US troops on the ground or using air strikes, Trump replied: ‘Could be, I mean, a lot of things — I envisage a lot of things.’ ‘They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers,’ he said Sunday. ‘We’re not going to allow that to happen.’ Pushing back on the accusations, president Bola Tinubu said over the weekend that ‘religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity’. Auta, 56, hails from Plateau state, where Christians and Muslims have long lived side by side. The state has also seen explosions of violence — including deadly sectarian riots in the capital Jos in 2001 and 2008. In recent years, Plateau and other states in Nigeria’s ‘Middle Belt’ have suffered deadly clashes between mostly Christian farmers and Fulani Muslim herders over dwindling land and resources. The conflict has often resulted in massive death tolls on the side of the farmers, with entire villages razed. Smaller-scale attacks on herders — including retaliatory killings of random ethnic Fulanis or their cattle — often generate fewer headlines in both the local and international press. Though the violence appears on the surface to fall across ethnic and religious lines, experts say the root causes lie in poor land management and policing in rural areas. Words like ‘genocide’ have been thrown around by those in Plateau frustrated by the escalating violence, though typically in ethnic, not religious terms. Claims of a ‘Christian genocide’ meanwhile have been pushed in recent years by separatist groups in the southeast. US-based firm Moran Global Strategies has been lobbying on behalf of separatists this year, advising congressional staff on what it said was Christian ‘persecution’, according to disclosure forms. Nigeria also faces a long-running jihadist conflict in its northeast, and ‘bandit’ gangs in the northwest who conduct kidnappings and village raids. The north’s population is mostly Muslim — meaning most of the victims are, too. ‘Even those who sold this narrative of Christian genocide know it is not true,’ said Abubakar Gamandi, a Muslim who heads a fishermen’s union in Borno state, the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict. Chukwuma Soludo, the Christian governor of Anambra state, also pushed back against US intervention, saying Washington ‘must act within the realm of international law’. But Trump’s rhetoric has resonated with some in Nigeria. Reverend Joseph Hayab, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the country’s north, said he rejected the framing of ‘farmer-herder violence’ and called Trump’s comments a ‘wake-up call’. ‘People are twisting the story as if Trump said he is coming to fight Nigeria. No, he is coming to deal with terrorists,’ he said. The Nigerian presidency suggested a meeting between the two leaders. Daniel Bwala, a spokesman for Tinubu, said ‘Donald Trump has his own style of communication’. Bwala suggested to AFP Sunday that Trump’s post was a way to ‘force a sit-down between the two leaders so they can iron out a common front to fight their insecurity’. Trump previously attacked South Africa over what he called a ‘genocide’ against its Dutch-descended Afrikaner community, and has offered them refugee status. Critics of the president said the rhetoric was part of Trump’s hardline diplomatic strategy.

{"title": "New Age | Responding to Trump, Nigeria says no tolerance for religious persecution", "body": "The Nigerian government on Tuesday said it does not tolerate religious persecution, responding to US president Donald Trump’s threats of military intervention over the killing of Christians by jihadists in the country. Trump said on social media that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack in Africa’s most populous nation because radical Islamists are ‘killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers’. But foreign minister Yusuf Tuggar insisted that the country’s constitution did not allow religious persecution, in the first comment by a senior Nigerian government official following Trump’s weekend threats. ‘It’s impossible for there to be a religious persecution that can be supported in any way, shape or form by the government of Nigeria at any level,’ Tuggar told a press conference in Berlin. Nigeria has a ‘constitutional commitment to religious freedom and rule of law’, the foreign minister added. Roughly evenly split between a mostly Christian south and Muslim-majority north, Nigeria is home to myriad conflicts, which experts say kill both Christians and Muslims, often without distinction. But claims of Christian ‘persecution’ in Nigeria have found traction online among the US and European right in recent months. Flanked by his German counterpart Johann Wadephul, Tuggar warned against any attempts to divide Nigeria along religious lines, drawing parallels with civil war-ravaged Sudan. ‘What we are trying to make the world understand is that we should not create another Sudan,’ he said. ‘We’ve seen what has happened with Sudan with agitations for the partitioning of Sudan based on religion, based on tribal sentiments and you can see the crisis even when the partitioning was done according to religion or according to tribe,’ Tuggar said. Trump has not suggested any division of Nigeria along religious lines, but said without evidence that ‘thousands of Christians are being killed (and) Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter’. Ikemesit Effiong, an analyst with the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence consultancy, suggests that Nigeria’s fears of partitioning are informed by history, with several major former British colonies having experienced ’violent partitions and secessions’. ‘Nigeria is actually sensitive to the fact that while our diversity can be a strength, it can also be a lever of division, of violence and eventually of partition,’ he said. Nigeria has denied that Christians have been targeted by jihadist attacks more than people from other faiths. Before Trump’s threat, Nigerian President Bola Tinubu had said that religious tolerance was ‘a core tenet of our collective identity’. Claims of a ‘Christian genocide’ have been pushed in recent years by separatist groups in the southeast. US-based firm Moran Global Strategies has been lobbying on behalf of separatists this year, advising congressional staff on what it said was Christian ‘persecution’, according to lobbying disclosures. The word ‘genocide’ has also been used by some individuals in the central parts of the country who are frustrated by the escalating violence there, though typically in ethnic, not religious terms. Nigeria also faces a long-running jihadist conflict in its northeast and ‘bandit’ gangs in the northwest who stage kidnappings, village raids and killings. The north’s population is mostly Muslim — meaning most of the victims are, too. Nigeria’s newly appointed chief of defence staff, Lieutenant General Olufemi Oluyede, told reporters on Monday that ‘there are no Christians being persecuted in Nigeria’. Other analysts suggest that Washington’s amped-up rhetoric could be related to Abuja rejecting demands to accept non-Nigerian deportees expelled from the United States as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown.

{"title": "New Age | ‘Inequality crisis’ threatens democracy, experts warn G20", "body": "Wealth inequality is a global emergency that threatens democracy and social cohesion, experts warned Tuesday, urging G20 leaders meeting in South Africa this month to establish a panel to tackle the crisis. The ‘inequality emergency’ is leaving billions hungry and could worsen under the United States’ ‘law of the jungle’ approach to trade under president Donald Trump, a committee led by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said in a new report. The proposed panel on inequality was inspired by the UN’s expert Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that analyses the risks and impact of global warming and proposes solutions. ‘One in four people worldwide now regularly skip meals, whilst billionaire wealth has now hit the highest level in history,’ said the report, which was commissioned for the Johannesburg summit of the world’s top economies in the Group of 20. Between 2000 and 2024, one per cent of the world’s population captured 41 per cent of all new wealth, of which just one per cent went to the poorest 50 per cent, it said. While income inequality between individuals declined in recent decades, largely due to economic development in China, there had been a major increase in inherited wealth, with $70 trillion expected to be handed down to heirs in the coming 10 years, it said. ‘The world understands that we have a climate emergency; it’s time we recognise that we face an inequality emergency too,’ Stiglitz said in a statement. ‘It isn’t just unfair and undermining societal cohesion — it’s a problem for our economy and our politics too,’ he said. The report warned that US policies, including the imposition of tariffs on trading partners, risked increasing inequality. ‘This new world, in which the powerful break rules with impunity and we move away from a rules-based international order towards a ‘law of the jungle’, could entrench unequal exchange, investment and technology patterns,’ it said. The report — commissioned by South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, whose own country one of the most unequal in the world, based on World Bank calculations — said economic inequality undermined democracy and led to increasing authoritarianism. ‘Inequality erodes trust in institutions, fuels political polarisation, can reduce participation among poorer citizens and residents, and creates social tensions of different kinds,’ it said. More than 80 per cent of countries experienced ‘high inequality’, based on the World Bank definition, and these nations were seven times more likely to experience democratic decline. The six-person committee said the proposed International Panel on Inequality would analyse all aspects of inequality — from land ownership to tax avoidance — and inform policymaking. Measures to tackle the problem included fair taxation of multinational corporations and the very wealthy, breaking up monopolies, stabilising prices and restructuring the debt of highly indebted countries. South Africa is the first African nation to hold the presidency of the G20 grouping of 19 countries, alongside the African Union and the European Union. Together they represent 85 per cent of global GDP, 75 per cent of international trade and two-thirds of the world’s population. Trump has indicated that he would not attend the November 22-23 summit. Stiglitz told reporters he did not expect Washington, the next G20 president, to back the proposal for an equality panel but ‘hopefully a majority of countries would eventually join in’. Ramaphosa said the report was ‘a blueprint for greater equality’, which South Africa wanted to put on the international agenda through its G20 presidency. ‘Addressing inequality is our inescapable generational challenge. This report lays out prudent and pragmatic steps we can take to reduce it,’ he said in a statement.

{"title": "New Age | Attack on key city in Sudan’s Kordofan region kills 40", "body": "An attack on a funeral in the key city of El-Obeid in Sudan’s central Kordofan region killed 40 people, the UN said Wednesday, as paramilitaries looked poised to launch an offensive. The United Nations’ humanitarian office did not specify when the attack took place or who was behind it, but said that the situation in the Kordofan region was continuing to worsen. The war in Sudan, which has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions more, has spread to new areas in recent days, sparking fears of an even greater humanitarian catastrophe. The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, at war with the military since 2023, was preparing to launch an assault in Kordofan after capturing El-Fasher, the last army stronghold in the vast western Darfur region. ‘Local sources report that at least 40 civilians were killed and dozens injured yesterday in an attack on a funeral gathering in El Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan State,’ the UN’s OCHA agency said. ‘Once again, OCHA calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities and for all parties to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law.’ People forced to flee El-Fasher have described horrific abuse, including rape, at the hands of the RSF. ‘The rapes were gang rapes. Mass rape in public, rape in front of everyone and no one could stop it,’ mother of four Amira said from a makeshift shelter in Tawila, some 70 kilometres west of El-Fasher. Doctors Without Borders said more than 300 survivors of sexual violence had sought care from its teams in Tawila after a previous RSF assault on the nearby Zamzam camp, which displaced more than 3,80,000 people last spring. ‘You’d be asleep and they’d come and rape you,’ said Amira, using a pseudonym while speaking during a webinar organised by campaign group Avaaz. ‘I saw with my own eyes people who couldn’t afford to pay and the fighters took their daughters instead. They said, ‘Since you can’t pay, we’ll take the girls.’ If you had daughters of a young age, they would take them immediately.’ Both sides in the war have been accused of committing atrocities. The fall of El-Fasher gave paramilitaries control over all five state capitals in Darfur, raising fears that Sudan would effectively be partitioned along an east-west axis. The RSF now dominates Darfur and parts of the south, while the army holds the north, east and central regions along the Nile and Red Sea. The UAE is accused by the UN of supplying arms to the RSF — allegations it has repeatedly denied. Meanwhile, the Sudanese army has received support from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran, according to observers. Sudan’s army-backed defence minister on Tuesday said the military would press on with its fight against the RSF after the security and defence council met to discuss a US proposal for a ceasefire. ‘We thank the Trump administration for its efforts and proposals to achieve peace,’ Hassan Kabroun said in a speech broadcast on state television, while adding that ‘preparations for the Sudanese people’s battle are on-going’. ‘Our preparations for war are a legitimate national right,’ he said. No details of the US truce proposal have been made public. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that Washington wanted ‘to see this conflict come to a peaceful end, just as we have with so many others, but the reality is it’s a very complicated situation on the ground right now’. She said the United States was ‘actively engaged’ in seeking a peace deal alongside Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The army-aligned authorities had rejected an earlier truce proposal from the four countries — referred to as the Quad — under which both the army and the RSF would be excluded from a transitional political process. The International Criminal Court on Monday voiced ‘profound alarm and deepest concern’ over the reports from El-Fasher, adding that such acts ‘may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity’. Speaking at a forum in Qatar on Tuesday, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres called on the warring parties to ‘come to the negotiating table, bring an end to this nightmare of violence — now’.

Opposition party Chadema said in a post on X late Tuesday that its vice-chairman John Heche — who was arrested on October 22 — had been charged with ‘terrorism acts’. It said police transported Heche from the capital Dodoma to the coastal Kinodoni region where he was charged. He refused to write a statement but would ‘exercise that right immediately after being taken to Court’, it added. It was unclear when he would appear in court. Rights groups have described a brutal crackdown on the opposition ahead of the election, with leaders either jailed or barred from running.

Violent protests broke out across the east African country on election day, with sources indicating hundreds — if not thousands — may have been killed, even as a six-day internet shutdown throttled the release of verified information. In a joint statement with six other NGOs on Friday, the Legal and Human Rights Centre said there was ‘excessive use of force against unarmed demonstrators, including reprisal killings of civilians, some in their own homes.’ ‘Families have been left traumatised, and children have witnessed violence against their parents,’ it said. It noted that young people in particular had been targeted, ‘often caught unaware’. Hundreds of people had been arrested, some remaining in detention without bail, it said. The statement warned that the ‘extent of human rights abuses is yet to be fully uncovered’, criticising the internet shutdown and media restrictions. Amos Ntobi, secretary with the opposition Chadema party, said he estimated hundreds had died in his northern Mwanza region alone. ‘We saw people being shot in broad daylight. There were bodies all over the streets — some people were killed instantly, others left badly wounded,’ he said. ‘There are so many bodies in the hospitals.’ Ntobi said he had attended at least nine funerals, two for children aged nine and 11 -- one shot near his home, the other while returning from a shop. He also said some local party leaders remained unaccounted for. In the run-up to the election, authorities swept the board of any opposition either by jailing them or barring them from running. In an initial report African election observers said Tanzanians had been unable to ‘express their democratic will’ thanks to the barring of opposition candidates, censorship and intimidation, as well as signs of rigging on election day. African Union election observers also said the poll was ‘compromised’.

{"title": "New Age | Tanzania charges over 200 with treason after polls protests", "body": "Tanzania charged more than 200 people with treason, a lawyer and judicial sources told AFP, with the opposition saying Saturday yet another of their leaders had been arrested. President Samia Suluhu Hassan won the October 29 poll with 98 per cent of the vote, according to the electoral commission, but the opposition, which was barred from participating, has branded the election a ‘sham’. Violent protests broke out across the east African country on election day, with sources indicating hundreds—if not thousands—may have been killed. At the same time, a days-long internet shutdown hampered the release of verified information. On Friday, hundreds of people appeared in court on Friday in the economic hub Dar es Salaam. ‘All of these ladies and gentlemen, numbering more than 250 in total, were arraigned in three separate cases... and they’re all charged with two sets of offences,’ lawyer Peter Kibatala told AFP on Friday. ‘The first set of offence is a conspiracy to commit treason. And the second set of offences is treason itself,’ he said. Judicial sources in the court told AFP they knew of at least 240 people charged. Opposition party Chadema says at least 800 people were killed in the election violence. Diplomatic and security have sources backed that estimate, adding there are credible reports the numbers could reach thousands. The authorities have so far declined to release any toll for dead or injured. On Saturday, Chadema said that deputy secretary general Amani Golugwa had been arrested by police in Arusha. ‘The arrest of the deputy secretary general means that only three of the party’s six top leaders remain free,’ the party said in a statement on X. Leader Tundu Lissu has been in detention since April facing treason charges, with the party’s vice-chairman John Heche detained in October, and later charged with ‘terrorism acts’. ‘We understand that the government intends to charge our leaders with treason in an attempt to cripple the Party’s leadership and paralyse its operations,’ Chadema added. It follows a police warning late Friday that they were looking for opposition party leaders—including secretary general John Mnyika, his deputy Amani Golugwa, and spokesperson Brenda Rupia—in connection with the violence. ‘We call on them to surrender to the police immediately,’ Tanzania police spokesperson David Misime said in a statement.

{"title": "New Age | Sudanese city ‘living in fear’ as paramilitary threat looms", "body": "Residents of the southern Sudanese city of El-Obeid have said they are living in fear as paramilitaries appear to prepare for an assault, with the army reporting shooting down a drone targeting the city on Saturday. The North Kordofan state capital, about 400 kilometres southwest of the national capital Khartoum, is a regional hub and a strategic prize for the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, at war with Sudan’s army since April 2023. While the RSF announced Thursday it had accepted a truce proposal put forward by mediators, the UN subsequently said it saw ‘preparations for intensified hostilities’, issuing a warning about the deteriorarting situation in the Kordofan region in particular. ‘We are especially worried after what happened in El-Fasher,’ Soaad Ali, from El-Obeid’s Karima neighbourhood, said, referring to the RSF’s capture of the last army stronghold in western Darfur after an 18-month siege. That takeover was followed by reports of mass killings, sexual violence, abductions and looting, triggering fears the conflict could spread into oil-rich Kordofan. El-Obeid, which hosts an airport, sits on a key supply route linking Darfur and Khartoum. Last month, the RSF captured Bara, north of El-Obeid, forcing more than 36,000 people to flee that town and four others in North Kordofan in less than a week, according to the UN. The group said last week it had massed forces in Bara to retake El-Obeid, ‘advising civilians to steer clear of military targets’. ‘We are living in fear,’ said a resident of El-Obeid’s Qubba neighbourhood, who asked to remain anonymous for security reasons. ‘Officials try to reassure us, but after what happened in Bara, our fears are growing.’ A military source — speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief the media — said on Saturday that air defences ‘shot down a drone launched by the RSF militia towards’ El-Obeid. The fall of El-Fasher two weeks ago gave the RSF control of all five state capitals in the vast western region, in addition to parts of the south. The army controls most of Sudan’s north, east and centre, including Khartoum. Since El-Fasher’s fall, more than 80,000 people have fled the city and surrounding areas, according to the UN. The General Coordination for Displaced People and Refugees in Darfur, an NGO, said Saturday that more than 16,000 people had arrived in Tawila and were in dire need of food, water and medical care. El-Fasher had a population of around 2,60,000 before the RSF takeover. Little is known about the fate of thousands still trapped in the city, which has been largely cut off from communications. Mathilde Vu, advocacy manager for the Norwegian Refugee Council in Sudan, said that many families arriving in Tawila came with ‘children who are not their own’. The children, she said, ‘have lost their parents on the way, either because they’ve disappeared in a chaos, or they’ve been detained, or they’ve been killed’. Survivors have said that women and men were separated on the way out of El-Fasher, and that hundreds of men were detained in nearby towns. Army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Saturday visited displaced people from El-Fasher in Al-Dabba city, about 1,000 kilometres north. The army-aligned government said that since the RSF siege on El-Fasher began in April 2024, more than 50,000 people had fled to Al-Dabba. The details of the ceasefire proposal put forward by the United States, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have not yet been made public. A senior Saudi official said that it laid out a three-month truce, during which both sides would be encouraged to hold talks in Jeddah on a permanent peace deal. The UAE has been accused by the UN of supplying arms to the RSF, allegations it has repeatedly denied. The Sudanese army, meanwhile, has received support from fellow mediators Egypt and Saudi Arabia, as well as from Turkey, Iran and Russia, according to observers. The army-aligned government has yet to publicly respond to the truce plan. Darfur’s army-aligned governor, Minni Arko Minnawi — who is based in the government forces’ temporary capital of Port Sudan — said on Saturday that a ceasefire could not take effect until paramilitaries pulled back. ‘The truce must be preceded by the withdrawal of the Janjaweed and mercenaries from residential areas, hospitals and cities, and the release of those abducted, including children and women, and securing the return of the displaced,’ Minnawi said on X, referring to the RSF. ‘Any truce without this means the division of Sudan.’ Since erupting more than two years ago, the war has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced nearly 12 million and triggered a hunger crisis.

{"title": "New Age | Zanzibar women turn to sponge farming as oceans heat up", "body": "At about 10 o’clock every morning, women in hijabs and loose long dresses wade through Zanzibar’s turquoise shallow tides to tend their sponge farms — a new lifeline after climate change upended their former work. Rising ocean temperatures, overfishing and pollution have steadily degraded marine ecosystems around the island, undermining a key source of income for locals in Jambiani village who long depended on farming seaweed. Instead, they have turned to sponge cultivation under a project set up by Swiss NGO Marine Cultures. Hot temperatures have killed seaweed and declining fish stocks have driven many fishermen to quit, said project manager Ali Mahmudi. But sponges — which provide shelter and food for sea creatures — tend to thrive in warmer waters. They are also lucrative as an organic personal care product, used for skin exfoliation. Depending on size, they can fetch up to $30 each and a single farm can have as many as 1,500 sponges. From the shore, black sticks can be seen jutting out of the water, holding lines of sponges. ‘I was shocked to learn that sponges exist in the ocean,’ Nasiri Hassan Haji, 53, said, recalling when she first learned about the practice more than a decade ago. The mother-of-four once farmed seaweed, describing the work as labour-intensive with meagre returns. In 2009, Marine Cultures launched a pilot farm with widowed women in Jambiani to test their potential in the archipelago, where more than a quarter of the 1.9 million population live below the poverty line. With demand for eco-friendly products on the rise, the market has grown steadily, with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimating the value of the natural sponge market at $20 million in 2020. ‘It has changed my life, I have been able to build my own house,’ said 53-year-old Shemsa Abbasi Suleiman, smiling with pride. Many other women have now joined a cooperative to expand the project, but it was not always smooth sailing. ‘At first I was afraid of getting into it because I did not know how to swim. Many discouraged me saying the water is too much and I will die,’ said Haji. Thanks to an NGO programme, she learned to swim at the age of 39. As well as making money for locals, sponges are beneficial to the marine environment. Studies show that a sponge’s skeletal structure aids carbon recycling within coral reef ecosystems, while its porous body naturally filters and purifies seawater. An estimated 60 per cent of the world’s marine ecosystems have been degraded or are being used unsustainably, according to the United Nations, which warns that the ‘ocean is in deep crisis’. Sponges are also known to help restore coral reefs, which support 25 per cent of marine life and are currently under threat. ‘What attracted me to this is the fact that we are not destroying the environment,’ said Haji. Zanzibar is part of Tanzania, where violent protests broke out on the mainland on election day last month, with sources indicating hundreds — if not thousands — may have been killed. Two weeks on, the government has yet to give any casualty numbers with the United Nations calling for investigations.

{"title": "New Age | INEQUALITY: 500 economists, experts urge G20 for action", "body": "More than 500 economists and other leading experts, including a Nobel laureate and a former United States treasury secretary, on Friday urged G20 leaders to establish an international panel to tackle extreme wealth disparities. The panel was a key recommendation of a task force created by G20 host South Africa and led by Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz ahead of the leaders’ meeting next week. Modelled on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it would analyse all aspects of inequality — from land ownership to tax avoidance — and seek to inform policymaking. In an open letter published on Friday, the experts — also including Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu, France’s Thomas Piketty, and former US treasury secretary and former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen — backed the idea. ‘We are profoundly concerned that extreme concentrations of wealth translate into undemocratic concentrations of power, unravelling trust in our societies and polarising our politics,’ they said. The Stiglitz report found that the world’s richest one per cent captured 41 per cent of all new wealth between 2000 and 2024. In contrast, just one per cent went to the poorest 50 per cent, according to data from the World Inequality Lab. ‘Inequality is not inevitable; it is a policy choice,’ the letter said. ‘Clear and proven steps can be taken to reduce it and build more equal societies and economies,’ they said, adding that experts stood ready to volunteer their time, as many do with the IPCC. South Africa, which will host the G20 leaders’ summit in Johannesburg on November 22–23 — the first ever held in Africa — has made tackling economic inequality a central theme of its presidency. It is unclear whether the resolution will be adopted, as the G20 is not a treaty-based organisation like the United Nations and has no legal charter or constitution, functioning instead as an informal forum that operates by consensus. Members are split over a range of policy issues, and the group’s richest member, the United States, has said it will boycott the Johannesburg summit, accusing South Africa’s agenda of being anti-American. Founded in 1999, the group brings together 19 countries plus the European Union and the African Union, representing about 85 per cent of global GDP and roughly two-thirds of the world’s population.

In a telephone call with Emirati foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Rubio ‘emphasised the importance of achieving a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan,’ state department spokesman Tommy Pigott said. The two also discussed the US-backed ceasefire in Gaza. The United Arab Emirates has earned favor with the United States as a rare Arab country with relations with Israel. Sudan’s army, which is in a bloody civil war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, has repeatedly accused the UAE of backing its rivals with weapons and mercenaries. The UAE has denied the accusations. Rubio on Wednesday said that the United States knew which countries were supplying weapons to the RSF and that he would raise concerns, although he declined to say if he was referring to the UAE. ‘I think something needs to be done to cut off the weapons and support that the RSF is getting as they continue with their advances,’ he said. The RSF recently seized the key city of Al-Fasher after a relentless siege, leading the UN Human Rights Council on Friday to order a probe of alleged atrocities.

Qatar, along with the United States and the African Union, has been engaged in months of back-and-forth talks aimed at ending the conflict in DRC’s mineral-rich east, where the M23 has captured key cities. DRC and M23 inked a ceasefire deal and an earlier framework in the Gulf emirate in July, but despite the agreement reports emerged of violations, with both sides accused of breaking the truce. The signing of the new deal, the Doha Framework for a comprehensive peace agreement, was completed at a ceremony attended by officials from the warring parties, the US and Qatar. At the ceremony, Qatar’s chief negotiator Mohammed Al-Khulaifi called the agreement ‘historic’, adding that mediators would continue efforts to achieve peace on the ground. Since taking up arms again at the end of 2021, the M23 armed group has seized swathes of land in eastern DRC with Rwanda’s backing, triggering a spiralling humanitarian crisis. Thousands were killed in a lightning offensive by the M23 in January and February, in which the group seized the key provincial capitals of Goma and Bukavu. The July deal signed in Doha followed an earlier, separate peace agreement between the Congolese and Rwandan governments inked in Washington in June.

{"title": "New Age | Over half of Sudan needs aid: NGO", "body": "More than half of Sudan’s population is in need of humanitarian aid, the head of the Danish Refugee Council told AFP, as fighting ravages the northeast African nation. Since breaking out in April 2023, the war between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced nearly 12 million and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. ‘We see a situation where more than 30 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. That is half of the population of Sudan,’ Danish Refugee Council secretary general Charlotte Slente told AFP by phone this week after a visit to a border region in neighbouring Chad. ‘The suffering we see is unimaginable.’ Sudan had a population of around 50 million people in 2024, according to the World Bank. The aid official’s comments came after a field visit to an area in Chad that borders Sudan’s western Darfur region, which has seen fierce fighting of late. Violence has escalated dramatically in recent weeks, with the RSF seizing control of the key town of El-Fasher—the army’s last stronghold in Darfur—after an 18-month siege and reports of atrocities multiplying. ‘There are violations that cross all international humanitarian laws,’ she added. Slente said the NGO had seen evidence of mass killings and sexual violence in Sudan. ‘We see detentions, we see abductions, forced displacement and torture,’ she said. She accused the international community of not doing enough. ‘Statements have a very limited impact both on the ongoing humanitarian needs on the ground, and they have not been able to stop the violence,’ she said. She warned that there were other cities still under siege that were not receiving the same level of attention. The town of Babanusa, the last army stronghold in West Kordofan state, has been under siege for several months, as have North Kordofan state capital El-Obeid and South Kordofan’s Kadugli and Dilling. ‘The international community must stop managing the consequences of this conflict and must start preventing the atrocities,’ said Slente.

{"title": "New Age | Gunmen kidnap 25 schoolgirls in northwestern Nigeria", "body": "Gunmen from a criminal gang kidnapped 25 people and killed a staff member in an early morning raid on a northwestern Nigerian girls’ secondary school on Monday, police said. The attack comes more than a decade after 276 girls were abducted from Chibok in the restive northeastern Borno state and sparked international outcry that and rallied people around the ‘#BringBackOurGirls’ global social media campaign. Since then, there has been a string of other abductions involving school children across northern parts of Nigeria. Police on Monday said the gang armed with ‘sophisticated weapons, shooting sporadically, stormed the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School’ in Kebbi state at about 4:00am (0300 GMT). Police were deployed but ‘unfortunately, the suspected bandits had already scaled through the fence of the school and abducted twenty-five students from their hostel to unknown destination,’ police said in a statement. The school deputy head was shot dead while a security guard was injured during the attack, according to a report prepared for the United Nations. The military, police tactical units and local vigilantes have ‘been deployed in the area and they are currently combing the bandits’ routes and nearby forest’ in a bid rescue the abducted students and arrest the gangs, police said. This is the second mass school abduction in Kebbi in four years, following the June 2021 incident when bandits took more than 100 students and staff members from a government college. The students were released in batches over two years after parents raised ransom. Some of the students were forcefully married off and returned with babies. Nigeria’s northwest has for years been seeing a rise in heavily armed criminal gangs known as ‘bandits’ who steal cattle, raid villages, kidnap and kill residents and loot and burn homes. It has become the region most affected by kidnappings. Africa’s most populous country has also been plagued by armed violence since the 2009 emergence of the Boko Haram group in the Lake Chad basin, in the northeast of the country. The kidnapping of schoolgirls from the town of Chibok on April 14, 2014 made headlines around the world. Almost 100 of the captives remain missing. More than 130 schoolchildren were kidnapped by gunmen in March last year in Kuriga, in another northwestern state of Kaduna. They were later released unharmed. Data on kidnapping in Nigeria is unreliable mainly due to under-reporting, but according to UNICEF there have been over 2,400 incidents of ‘grave violations verified, affecting over 6,800 children’ in Nigeria’s northeastern region in nine years since 2014. A report last year by the charity Save the Children found more than 1,680 pupils were kidnapped in Nigerian schools from early 2014 to the end of 2022. As the country grapples with security challenges on several fronts, hostage-taking has spiralled into a nationwide industry and become a favoured tactic of bandit gangs and jihadists. In the northwest, authorities have tried to negotiate with bandits, striking peace deals and deploying vigilante groups. But they have had little success and critics say the kidnapping crisis is out of control.

{"title": "New Age | Nigeria school kidnapping draws fresh US ire", "body": "A top Nigerian general has ordered his troops to fight ‘day and night’ to rescue 25 schoolgirls whose kidnapping in the northwest has been seized on by US president Donald Trump’s followers. The early Monday morning raid on a secondary school in Kebbi State was the latest in a string of abductions of schoolchildren in northern Nigeria, more than a decade after Boko Haram’s infamous kidnapping of 276 girls in the northeast sparked international uproar. While taking place in the Muslim-majority north, the Kebbi kidnapping has become another flashpoint to draw the ire of the US right following Trump’s threats of military intervention over the alleged killing of Nigeria’s Christians. ‘You must continue day and night fighting. We must find these children,’ Major General Waidi Shaibu, recently promoted to chief of army staff, told troops deployed to Kebbi State on Monday. Shaibu urged the soldiers to ‘leave no stone unturned’ in the search for the schoolgirls. Though police rushed to the Government Girls Comprehensive Secondary School in the town of Maga, the gang had managed to scale the fence and abduct the students after killing the school’s vice-principal. Kebbi is caught between the jihadist threat from neighbouring Niger and the scourge of criminal gangs who loot villages while ransoming, kidnapping and killing residents across the north of Africa’s most populous country. Kebbi State police said on Tuesday that the abducted schoolchildren were all Muslim. But Republican Riley Moore of the US House of Representatives, in a post on X urging his followers to pray for the 25 girls, seized on the kidnapping to echo Trump’s claims of the persecution of Nigeria’s Christians. ‘While we don’t have all the details on this horrific attack, we know that the attack occurred in a Christian enclave in Northern Nigeria,’ Moore wrote. Trump at the start of November said he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack in Nigeria because radical Islamists are ‘killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers’. The Nigerian government has rejected that narrative, insisting that the country’s various security crises have left more Muslims dead. Nigeria is the scene of numerous conflicts, including jihadist insurgencies, which kill both Christians and Muslims, often indiscriminately. Amina Hassan, the wife of the murdered vice-principal, Hassan Makuku, told Nigerian television that she had tried to wake her husband up after hearing noise outside their house at 3:30am (0230 GMT), before the gunmen burst in. ‘We started struggling with them and one of them pulled out his gun and shot my husband, then he dragged me by my hand outside the house and I told them to leave me alone, that I would not go with them since they have killed the father of my children,’ Hassan said. ‘I was still arguing with them when my daughter came out, then they left me and went to her and took her with them,’ she said, adding that her daughter managed to escape into the bush after the attackers got distracted by the schoolgirls. Monday’s raid was the second mass school abduction in Kebbi in four years, following a June 2021 incident when bandits took more than 100 students and staff members from a government college. Those students were released in batches over two years after parents raised ransoms. Some of the students were forcefully married off and returned with babies.

{"title": "New Age | Pupils, teachers kidnapped from Catholic school in central Nigeria", "body": "Armed gang members kidnapped pupils and teachers from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, officials said Friday, in the second such incident in less than a week. The school kidnappings and an attack on a church earlier this week came weeks after US president Donald Trump threatened military action over what he described as the targeted killings of Nigeria’s Christians by radical Islamists, a narrative rejected by the Nigerian government. The Catholic Church in the area said in a statement that ‘armed attackers invaded’ the school between 1:00am and 3:00am, abducting ‘pupils, students, teachers and a security’ guard who was shot. The Niger state government said it had ‘received with deep sadness the disturbing news of the kidnapping of pupils from St. Mary’s School in Agwara local government area’. ‘The exact number of abducted pupils is yet to be confirmed as security agencies continue to assess the situation,’ Abubakar Usman, the state government secretary, said in a statement. After gunmen on Monday stormed a secondary school in Kebbi state in northwestern Nigeria, abducting 25 schoolgirls, Friday’s attack further raises alarm over security in Africa’s most populous country. For years, heavily armed criminal gangs locally known as ‘bandits’ have been intensifying attacks in rural areas of northwest and central Nigeria with little state presence, killing thousands and conducting kidnappings for ransom. The gangs have camps in a vast forest straddling several states including Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger from where they launch attacks. The state government said the school had defied orders to temporarily close all boarding schools in parts of the state following an intelligence report of an ‘increased threat level’ in parts of northern Niger that border Kebbi. Niger’s state police said its tactical units and the military were deployed to search for the pupils. Police said they received a report that ‘armed bandits invaded’ the secondary school and ‘abducted a yet to be ascertained number of students from the school’s hostel’. It said security agencies were ‘combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students’. President Bola Tinubu’s government said earlier this week that security forces had been placed on high alert. He has sent a defence minister to lead the search for the Kebbi school girls. Tinubu’s office said minister of state for defence Alhaji Bello Matawalle had ‘experience in dealing with banditry and mass kidnapping’, after he secured the release of 279 students aged between 10 and 17 who had been kidnapped from a secondary school in 2021 in western Zamfara state. In a separate attack on a church in western Nigeria on Tuesday, gunmen killed two people during a service that was recorded and broadcast online. Dozens of worshippers are believed to have been abducted. As Nigeria grapples with security challenges on several fronts, hostage-taking has spiralled nationwide and become a favoured tactic of bandit gangs and jihadists. Although bandits have no ideological leanings and are motivated by financial gains, their increasing alliance with jihadists from the northeast has been a source of concern for authorities and security analysts. Jihadists have for 16 years been waging an insurrection in the northeast with the aim of establishing a Caliphate. The jihadist violence has killed more than 40,000 people and displaced around two million in the northeast since it erupted in 2019.

{"title": "New Age | 315 seized in 2nd Nigerian mass school kidnapping", "body": "A Christian group on Saturday said 315 students and teachers were seized a day earlier in Nigeria’s second mass school abduction in a week, as security fears mounted in Africa’s most populous nation. The early Friday raid on St Mary’s co-education school in Niger state in central Nigeria came after gunmen on Monday stormed a secondary school in neighbouring Kebbi state, abducting 25 girls. The Christian Association of Nigeria said the new number came ‘after a verification exercise’ following the early Friday mass kidnapping, and added that ‘The number of victims abducted ... is now 303 students and 12 teachers.’ The number of boys and girls kidnapped from St Mary’s is almost half of the school’s student population of 629. The Nigerian government has not commented on the number of students and teachers abducted. Authorities in the nearby states of Katsina and Plateau have meanwhile ordered all schools to close as a precautionary measure. The Niger state government closed many schools and president Bola Tinubu cancelled international engagements, including attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, to handle the crisis. The two abduction operations and an attack on a church in the west of the country, in which two people were killed, have happened since US president Donald Trump threatened military action over what he called the killing of Christians by radical Islamists in Nigeria. Nigeria is still scarred by the kidnapping of nearly 300 girls by Boko Haram jihadists at Chibok in northestern Borno state more than a decade ago. Some of those girls are still missing. CAN said Reverend Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, who is also the Catholic Bishop of Kontagora diocese under which the school falls, gave the update after visiting St Mary’s. ‘After we left the school at Papiri, we decided to make calls, do verification exercise and do further enquiries on those we had thought escaped successfully, only to discover that 88 more students were also captured after they tried to escape,’ he said. ‘This now makes it 303 students, including 12 teachers—4 females and 8 males—bringing the total to number of abducted persons to 315,’ he said in a statement. For years, heavily armed criminal gangs have been intensifying attacks in rural areas of northwest and central Nigeria, where there is little state presence, killing thousands and conducting kidnappings for ransom. The gangs have camps in a vast forest straddling several states including Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger. A UN source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the children abducted on Monday in Kebbi had probably been taken to the Birnin Gwari forest in nearby Kaduna state. In a separate attack on a church in western Nigeria on Tuesday, gunmen killed two people during a service that was being broadcast online. Dozens of worshippers are believed to have been abducted. As Nigeria grapples with security challenges on several fronts, hostage-taking has spiralled nationwide and become a favoured tactic of bandit gangs and jihadists.

{"title": "New Age | G20 leaders warn of geopolitical fractures", "body": "The G20’s role in fixing economic crises is threatened by geopolitical fractures and competition, leaders warned Saturday at a summit in South Africa boycotted by the United States. European leaders attending the G20 summit—the first held in Africa—also scrambled on the sidelines to respond to a unilateral plan pushed by US president Donald Trump to end the war in Ukraine on terms favouring Russia. ‘We are struggling to resolve major crises together around this table’ and ‘the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle,’ French president Emmanuel Macron warned fellow leaders at the start of the summit. ‘There’s no doubt, the road ahead is tough,’ agreed British prime minister Keir Starmer, adding: ‘We need to find ways to play a constructive role again today in the face of the world challenges.’ Chinese premier Li Qiang said ‘unilateralism and protectionism are rampant’ and ‘many people are pondering what exactly is happening to global solidarity’. The summit’s host, South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, downplayed Trump’s absence and argued the G20 remained key for international cooperation. ‘The G20 underscores the value of the relevance of multilateralism. It recognises that the challenges that we face can only be resolved through cooperation, collaboration and partnership,’ Ramaphosa said. The G20 comprises 19 countries plus the European Union and the African Union, and accounts for 85 per cent of the world’s GDP and two-thirds of its population. But the Johannesburg summit was undermined by the American boycott, and China’s Li stood in for an absent president Xi Jinping, while Russia sent a Kremlin official, Maxim Oreshkin, instead of president Vladimir Putin, who is wanted under an International Criminal Court warrant. The leaders present adopted a G20 summit declaration early in their meeting that covered climate, energy, debt sustainability and a critical-minerals pact—and a joint call for a ‘just’ peace in Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and the ‘Occupied Palestinian Territory’. Argentina’s foreign minister Pablo Quirno—standing in for absent president Javier Milei, a Trump ally—objected to ‘how certain geopolitical issues are framed in the document’, specifically the Israel-Palestinian conflict. But Ramaphosa noted that did not block the declaration’s adoption by participants, who also included Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. As soon as the opening ceremony was over, Starmer, Macron and German chancellor Friedrich Merz rushed into a meeting to discuss Trump’s plan for Ukraine. That huddle was soon expanded to include other leaders from Europe, and from Australia, Canada and Japan, an EU official said. ‘We are working on making the US plan something more able to be applied, based on previous dialogue,’ a European diplomatic source told AFP. Sources said there had been some communication with Washington, but no plans for any leaders to fly over to see Trump. On Friday, after a call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, Macron, Starmer and Merz stressed that any plan for Ukraine needed the ‘joint support and consensus of European partners and NATO allies’. Trump has said he wants Kyiv to accept his 28-point proposals—which involve ceding territory to Russia and cutting the size of Ukraine’s military—by Thursday. While the United States skipped the Johannesburg summit because it said it viewed its priorities—including on trade and on climate—as running counter to its policies, it still intended to take up the G20 baton for the next gathering. Trump plans to stage that summit in 2026 at a Florida golf club he owns. Washington has said it will send the US charge d’affaires from its embassy in South Africa only for the handover ceremony on Sunday. But South Africa’s foreign minister, Ronald Lamola, said it would need to send a higher-ranking official of the ‘right level’. ‘The president of the Republic of South Africa will not be handing over to the charge d’affaires from the US,’ he said.

{"title": "New Age | Guinea-Bissau votes to elect new president, parliament", "body": "Voters in coup-prone Guinea-Bissau cast their ballots Sunday to pick a new president, hoping to turn the page on endemic political turmoil despite the main opposition party being barred from the race. Around 8,60,000 voters will choose between 12 presidential candidates, with stability a major issue given the multiple political crises that have rocked the west African nation since independence from Portugal in 1974, including four coups and numerous attempted coups. At the top of the list of demands for many is improved living conditions, including better health care, education and infrastructure. Guinea-Bissau’s population of some 2.2 million is also calling for more jobs and reforms to combat poverty, corruption and drug trafficking. With nearly 40 per cent of the population living in extreme poverty, Guinea-Bissau is among the world’s poorest countries. It is also a hub for drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe, a trade fuelled by the country’s long history of political instability. Polling stations opened at 7:00am (local time and GMT) and are scheduled to close at 5:00 pm. First results are expected no later than Thursday. Alamar Bidinthile, 40, said he was voting for ‘change’ and ‘stability’. Mayo Sa, a 53-year-old construction worker, added: ‘I have been voting since I was young but there has been no change in the country. I hope this time that won’t be the case’. Incumbent president Umaro Sissoco Embalo, 53, is favoured to win in the first round. If he succeeds, he will become the first head of state to serve two consecutive terms since the introduction of the multiparty system in 1994. His biggest opponent is opposition candidate Fernando Dias, who has received the support of the powerful PAIGC opposition party, which was barred from the election. The vote marks the first time in Guinea-Bissau’s history that PAIGC, which led the former Portuguese colony to independence in 1974 and was the country’s longstanding single party, will be absent from the ballot. The party and its leader Domingos Simoes Pereira, who only recently returned from exile, were disqualified from running after the Supreme Court ruled their legislative and presidential applications had been submitted after the deadline. Pereira and Embalo are arch political rivals: The last presidential election in 2019 was marked by a four-month post-election crisis as both men claimed victory. Sunday’s elections will also see voters choose all 102 members of parliament. In 2023, Embalo dissolved the legislature — which was dominated by the opposition — and has since ruled by decree. The opposition says PAIGC’s exclusion from the presidential and parliamentary elections amounts to ‘manipulation’ and maintains that Embalo’s term expired on February 27, five years to the day after his inauguration. Despite the tumult, the three-week campaigning period unfolded with a festive atmosphere and concluded Friday without any major incidents or violence. Lucia Bird, an expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime, said that ‘in Guinea-Bissau, problems usually arise after elections’. She said she fears that, as in 2019, allegations of irregularities will occur after the vote. More than 6,780 security forces, including from the Economic Community of West African States Stabilisation Force, have been deployed for the vote and the post-election period. Guinea-Bissau’s air space, as well as land and sea borders, will be closed all day Sunday.

{"title": "New Age | G20 grapples with splintering world order", "body": "G20 leaders gathered Sunday in South Africa hailed multilateralism — even as they struggled to adapt to a changing world order beset by go-it-alone US policies, wars and deepening geopolitical rivalries. The final day of their weekend summit — boycotted by the United States — kicked off with a searching discussion on how the G20 can survive in a fragmenting world. ‘We are not experiencing a transition, but a rupture,’ acknowledged Canadian prime minister Mark Carney to journalists just before the summit session. ‘Too many countries are retreating into geopolitical blocs or the battlegrounds of protectionism,’ he said, but added: ‘In every rupture resides the responsibility to build—nostalgia is not a strategy.’ Dozens of leaders from key economies around the world — including Europe, China, India, Japan, Turkey, Brazil and Australia — attended the summit, the first to be held in Africa. US president Donald Trump’s government snubbed the event, saying South Africa’s priorities — including cooperation on trade and climate — ran counter to its policies. The United States is retreating from multilateral forums as it stokes trade volatility with sweeping tariffs and reverses commitments to fight global warming. Trump’s officials have also made unfounded accusations of a ‘white genocide’ in South Africa. In a joint G20 statement issued Saturday, the leaders present said they were meeting ‘against the backdrop of rising geopolitical and geo-economic competition and instability, heightened conflicts and wars, deepening inequality, increasing global economic uncertainty and fragmentation’. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa admitted ‘challenges’, but said: ‘The G20 underscores the value of the relevance of multilateralism.’ The leaders’ declaration was issued despite Washington objecting to the summit making any statement in the name of the G20. The UK-based Oxfam charity said ‘South Africa has set an example to the world in ensuring the G20 stood firm and collectively agreed on a leader’s declaration — defending multilateralism — despite powerful opposition’. Nevertheless, French president Emmanuel Macron on Saturday said that ‘the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle’. It needs to refocus its priorities on strategic economic issues going forward, he said, noting ‘difficulties’ in the G20 finding common approaches to armed conflicts around the world. That somewhat reflected a US intention to limit G20 discussions to just macroeconomic topics as it takes on hosting duties next year — when Trump plans to hold the summit at a Florida golf club he owns. The G20 — comprising 19 nations plus the European Union and the African Union — was founded in the wake of the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis as a forum to boost global economic and financial stability. Over time, its discussions have broadened to also cover climate change, sustainable development, global health and conflicts. While those areas have economic implications, they are also political — often resulting in impasses or omissions in drafting summit declarations. Divisions have only widened over Russia’s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza. Carney — whose country this year holds the G7 presidency, to be taken up by France next year — also said that ‘the centre of gravity in the global economy is shifting’, implying that the G20 needed to take greater note of emerging economies and the global South. William Gumede, a management professor at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa who advises governments, including Turkey’s, noted that several countries not part of the G20 were invited to the summit, including African ones. ‘Bringing emerging powers and developing countries was like creating a whole new world into the G20 and that actually helped to neutralise the Trump absence,’ he said. ‘This summit has actually thrown a lifeline to multilateralism, breathing new life into it,’ he said.

The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres (500 miles) northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted on Sunday for several hours. The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet. Ash clouds from the volcano drifted over Yemen, Oman, India, and northern Pakistan, the VAAC said. In videos shared on social media, which AFP could not immediately verify, a thick column of white smoke can be seen rising. The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program said Hayli Gubbi has had no known eruptions during the Holocene, which began around 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age. Simon Carn, a volcanologist and professor at the Michigan Technological University, confirmed on Bluesky that Hayli Gubbi ‘has no record of Holocene eruptions’. Afar authorities have not yet responded to AFP inquiries about possible casualties or the number of displaced people.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan army chief slams Quad truce proposal as ‘worst yet’", "body": "Sudan’s army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said Sunday the latest truce proposal sent by US envoy Massad Boulos on behalf of a group of mediators was the ‘worst yet’ and unacceptable to his government. In a video address released by his office, he said the Quad, which in addition to the United States includes Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, was ‘biased’ as long as Abu Dhabi was a member. He accused Boulos of parroting talking points from Abu Dhabi, which has been widely accused of arming the RSF. The UAE denies the accusations. The army chief said that with the UAE as a member, the Quad was ‘not innocent of responsibility, especially since the entire world has witnessed the UAE’s support for rebels against the Sudanese state’. Since war broke out between Burhan’s forces and his former ally Mohamed Hamdan Daglo’s RSF in April 2023, mediation efforts have failed to bring about a ceasefire, with both sides vying for a decisive military victory. On Sunday, Burhan said the proposal received this month ‘eliminates the armed forces, dissolves security agencies, and keeps the militia where they are.’ The RSF at the time said it agreed to the truce. ‘If this is where the mediation is going, then we consider it biased, especially Massad Boulos who threatens us and speaks like he wants to impose things on us. We fear he could be an obstacle to the peace all of us Sudanese want,’ the army chief said. Burhan’s singling out of Boulos comes days after US president Donald Trump declared he would end the war, after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman urged him to get involved. The career soldier and de facto ruler of Sudan thanked both leaders on Sunday, welcoming the initiative as an ‘honest’ one. But he addressed mediators saying: ‘If you want a solution, come with a positive approach, come with a proper approach.’ ‘This is a war for survival,’ he reiterated, insisting the only acceptable peace deal would include a total retreat of the RSF, who would be confined to specific areas. The war has killed tens of thousands, displaced 12 million and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. The warring sides have shirked attempts at negotiation, with both believing they can win the war on the battlefield, according to analysts. The army is currently on the back foot, after losing its last major stronghold in the Darfur region last month to the RSF. It currently holds the country’s north, east and centre including the capital Khartoum, while the RSF controls the west and with its allies, parts of southern Kordofan.

{"title": "New Age | Parents of abducted Nigeria students plead for rescue", "body": "Parents of dozens of children kidnapped last week from a Catholic school in Nigeria are desperate for their release, with one father crying out that his son is so young he has not yet learned to speak. Armed gangs seized more than 300 children from a Catholic school in Nigeria’s central-western Niger state, in a resurgence of the mass kidnappings that have long harrowed Africa’s most populous country. The same week, 25 schoolgirls were taken from another school, and 38 worshippers were seized from a church in the east of the country. At least 50 taken from the Catholic school, St Mary’s, managed to escape, but more than 265 children and teachers are still being held. ‘My son is a small boy. He doesn’t even know how to talk,’ Michael Ibrahim said as parents of those still in captivity anxiously awaited their children’s safe release. His son, who is four, suffers from asthma, he said. ‘We don’t know the condition in which the boy is,’ said Ibrahim, adding the abduction had so sickened his wife that she had to be taken to hospital. Some of the children abducted are nursery-school age. ‘I need my child back. I need my child back. If I had the power to bring my child back, I would do it,’ another father, Sunday Isaiku, said. Nigeria has a history of mass kidnappings, mostly carried out by criminal gangs looking for ransom payments and targeting vulnerable populations in poorly policed rural areas. Many of the captives get freed or rescued within weeks or months, while some escape on their own. Nigeria’s first high-profile mas kidnapping was that of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, when Islamist group Boko Haram forced 276 girls from their dormitories in the country’s northeast. More than a decade later, about 90 of those girls are still missing. Nigeria suffers from a persistent security crisis fuelled by jihadist attacks and violence by ‘bandit’ gangs that raid villages, kill people and kidnap for ransom. US president Donald Trump earlier this month threatened military action over what he described as the killing of Nigeria’s Christians — a claim the Nigerian government rejects. The religiously diverse country of 230 million people is the scene of long-brewing conflicts that have killed both Christians and Muslims, often indiscriminately. Four days after the St Mary’s children were taken, no group has claimed the abduction or contacted the school demanding ransom. ‘At this moment, what we want is to get our 265 students and pupils back and I’m calling on the federal government and the state government to join forces,’ Reverend Bulus Yohanna of Kontagora Catholic diocese said. ‘Please help us to see them back’ and ‘reunite with their parents’. For Ibrahim, the government is his only hope to see his son back. ‘We don’t know any other way to bring these children if not through the government. I appeal to the government to do all within its powers to see their children are back,’ he said, speaking in the local Hausa language. Health worker Cidi Mohamed, 27, recalled hearing gunshots at the school on the night of the raid and then seeing the kidnappers leave with the children. ‘They put the children at the front and the back’ of motorcycles, he said. Global conflict monitoring group ACLED has recorded 42 incidents of violence targeting students in Nigeria this year, which is a decline from 71 in 2024. About 40 per cent of the abductions involved demands for ransom. ‘Fragmented bandit groups and other armed actors are the most common perpetrators in these abduction or kidnappings, while Islamist groups are far less frequently responsible for targeted violence against students,’ said ACLED.

{"title": "New Age | Guinea-Bissau military appoints general as leader after coup", "body": "The military of Guinea-Bissau appointed a general as the country’s new leader for the duration of one year Thursday, a day after seizing power, arresting the president and derailing the announcement of national election results. Soldiers patrolled the area around the presidential palace in Bissau on Thursday morning and a few people were seen walking along the main road leading to the building, where heavy gunfire rang out the previous day. After taking the oath of office in a ceremony at the military’s headquarters, General Horta N’Tam, chief of staff of the army, declared that ‘I have just been sworn in to lead the High Command,’ AFP journalists observed. Dozens of heavily armed soldiers were deployed at the scene as he told a press conference that actions were necessary ‘to block operations that aimed to threaten our democracy’. A group of officers on Wednesday said they had seized ‘total control’ of the coup-prone country, suspending the electoral process as Guinea-Bissau awaited the results of last Sunday’s vote, which President Umaro Sissoco Embalo had been expected to win. Having served until now as the chief of staff of the country’s army, N’Tam is considered to have been close in recent years with President Embalo. N’Tam said evidence had been ‘sufficient to justify the operation’ adding that ‘necessary measures are urgent and important and require everyone’s participation’. Sandwiched between Guinea and Senegal, Guinea-Bissau has experienced four coups since independence from Portugal in 1974, as well as multiple attempted coups. On Wednesday afternoon, General Denis N’Canha, head of the presidential military office, told journalists that the military was assuming control of the country ‘until further notice’ after a plan involving ‘drug lords’ had been uncovered, which had included ‘the introduction of weapons into the country to alter the constitutional order’. In addition to halting ‘the entire electoral process’, he said military forces had suspended ‘all media programming’ and imposed a mandatory curfew. All land, air and sea borders were shut Wednesday following the coup, but General Lassana Mansali, said Thursday they had been re-opened. Embalo was arrested Wednesday and being held at general-staff headquarters where he was being ‘well-treated’, according to a military source. A senior officer added that ‘the chief of staff and the minister of the interior’ had also been detained. Opposition leader Domingos Simoes Pereira, who was barred from last weekend’s presidential election by the Supreme Court, was additionally arrested Wednesday, according to two sources close to him. The chair of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ‘unequivocally condemns the coup d’etat’ in a statement Thursday while recalling the body’s ‘strict zero-tolerance for unconstitutional changes of government’. Guinea-Bissau is among the world’s poorest countries and is also a hub for drug trafficking between Latin America and Europe, a trade facilitated by the nation’s long history of political tumult. Political stability was one of the major issues in the election, given the nation’s turbulent past. In October the country’s army said it thwarted an ‘attempt to subvert the constitutional order’ and arrested several senior military officers. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was ‘following the situation with deep concern’, his spokesman said, while the country’s former colonial ruler Portugal discouraged ‘any act of institutional or civic violence’. Sadibou Marong, director of Reporters Without Borders’s Sub-Saharan Africa office, meanwhile said the country’s media suspension amounted to a serious violation of the right to information. ‘The population must be able to be informed about what is happening in the country, especially in this context of political crisis’, he said. The west African region has been rife with coups in recent years, with Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Guinea all seeing their governments toppled.

{"title": "New Age | South Africa denounces Trump’s G20 ban", "body": "South Africa denounced US president Donald Trump’s decision to bar it from the 2026 G20 summit. The country called the move punitive and driven by distortions that erode global cooperation. The two countries are at odds over a range of domestic and foreign policies -- a standoff that came to a head after Washington skipped the G20 summit in Johannesburg last week. Trump said South Africa would not be invited to next year’s meeting, which he plans to host at his own golf resort in Miami. Pretoria fired back in a statement late Wednesday, saying South Africa was a G20 member in its own right and that its place in the bloc was decided by the other members. ‘South Africa is a sovereign constitutional democratic country and does not appreciate insults from another country about its membership and worth in participating in global platforms,’ the presidency said, vowing to continue participating in all G20 meetings. Trump had cited what he described as ‘horrific Human Right Abuses’ endured by white farmers, and South Africa’s refusal to symbolically hand off the G20 presidency at the end of the Johannesburg summit to the United States. South Africa on Tuesday handed over the G20 presidency at a low-key foreign ministry event after refusing to do so at the summit to a US embassy representative, insisting Washington be represented ‘at the right level.’ Trump has singled out South Africa for harsh treatment on a number of issues since he returned to the White House in January, most notably on his false claims of a ‘white genocide’ in the country. ‘It is regrettable that despite the efforts and numerous attempts by President (Cyril) Ramaphosa and his administration to reset the diplomatic relationship with the US, President Trump continues to apply punitive measures against South Africa based on misinformation and distortions about our country,’ Pretoria said. The two nations have also fallen out over issues including South Africa’s case accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza at the International Court of Justice, the UN’s top court.

{"title": "New Age | Nigeria declares national emergency after mass kidnappings", "body": "Nigeria’s president Bola Tinubu on Wednesday declared a ‘nationwide security emergency’ as the country scrambled to respond to a wave of mass kidnappings that have seen hundreds of people, mostly schoolchildren, captured in a week. ‘This is a national emergency, and we are responding by deploying more boots on the ground, especially in security-challenged areas,’ Tinubu said in a statement. Within days, assailants across the country kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 worshippers, more than 300 schoolchildren and teachers from a Catholic school, 13 young women and girls walking near a farm, and another 10 women and children. Dozens have been rescued and others escaped but 265 children and their teachers seized from a Catholic boarding school in the country’s Niger state on Friday are still missing. ‘In view of the emerging security situation, I have decided to declare a nationwide security emergency and order additional recruitment into the Armed Forces,’ Tinubu said. At the weekend he ordered a redeployment of police VIP bodyguards to core policing duties, and has ordered the hiring of another 50,000 new police recruits. According to the European Union Agency for Asylum more than 1,00,000 of the estimated 3,71,000-strong force were previously assigned to protect politicians and VIPs. In addition to a 16-year jihadist insurgency raging in the northeast, Nigeria is plagued by persistent insecurity, with frequent kidnappings for ransom. The first mass abduction to shock Nigeria was in 2014 when the jihadist group Boko Haram kidnapped 276 teenage girls in Chibok, in the northeast, sparking an international outcry. Since then thousands of kidnappings have occurred. Some go unreported. For years, heavily armed criminal gangs have been intensifying attacks in rural areas of northwest and central Nigeria, where there is little state presence, killing thousands and conducting kidnappings for ransom. The gangs have camps in a vast forest straddling several states including Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto, Kebbi and Niger from where they launch attacks. Tinubu said he was also authorising the intelligence department to ‘immediately’ deploy forest guards to ‘flush out the terrorists and bandits lurking in our forests’ as well as to hire more staff to patrol them. ‘The times require all hands on deck,’ he said. He vowed to continue ‘efforts to rescue’ the students and other people still in captivity. In the 12 months between July last year and June 2025, at least 4,722 people were kidnapped in 997 incidents, and at least 762 were killed, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence. It said kidnappers demanded some 48 billion naira overall but only managed to get 2.57 billion naira (around $1.66 million). During that period ‘Nigeria’s kidnap-for-ransom crisis consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry,’ said the Lagos-based security advisory firm. The latest attacks struck just weeks after US president Donald Trump threatened Nigeria with military action over the alleged killing of Christians in large numbers by radical Islamists. Tinubu urged mosques and churches to seek security protection when they congregate for prayers, particularly in vulnerable areas.

{"title": "New Age | Parents of abducted Nigeria students plead for rescue", "body": "Parents of dozens of children kidnapped last week from a Catholic school in Nigeria are desperate for their release, with one father crying out that his son is so young he has not yet learned to speak. Armed gangs seized more than 300 children from a Catholic school in Nigeria’s central-western Niger state, in a resurgence of the mass kidnappings that have long harrowed Africa’s most populous country. The same week, 25 schoolgirls were taken from another school, and 38 worshippers were seized from a church in the east of the country. At least 50 taken from the Catholic school, St Mary’s, managed to escape, but more than 265 children and teachers are still being held. ‘My son is a small boy. He doesn’t even know how to talk,’ Michael Ibrahim said as parents of those still in captivity anxiously awaited their children’s safe release. His son, who is four, suffers from asthma, he said. ‘We don’t know the condition in which the boy is,’ said Ibrahim, adding the abduction had so sickened his wife that she had to be taken to hospital. Some of the children abducted are nursery-school age. ‘I need my child back. I need my child back. If I had the power to bring my child back, I would do it,’ another father, Sunday Isaiku, said. Nigeria has a history of mass kidnappings, mostly carried out by criminal gangs looking for ransom payments and targeting vulnerable populations in poorly policed rural areas. Many of the captives get freed or rescued within weeks or months, while some escape on their own. Nigeria’s first high-profile mass kidnapping was that of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, when Islamist group Boko Haram forced 276 girls from their dormitories in the country’s northeast. More than a decade later, about 90 of those girls are still missing. Nigeria suffers from a persistent security crisis fuelled by jihadist attacks and violence by ‘bandit’ gangs that raid villages, kill people and kidnap for ransom. US president Donald Trump earlier this month threatened military action over what he described as the targeted killing of Nigeria’s Christians — a claim the Nigerian government rejects. The religiously diverse country of 230 million people is the scene of long-brewing conflicts that have killed both Christians and Muslims, often indiscriminately. Four days after the St Mary’s children were taken, no group has claimed the abduction or contacted the school demanding ransom. ‘At this moment, what we want is to get our 265 students and pupils back and I’m calling on the federal government and the state government to join forces,’ Reverend Bulus Yohanna of Kontagora Catholic diocese said. ‘Please help us to see them back’ and ‘reunite with their parents’. For Ibrahim, the government is his only hope to see his son back. ‘We don’t know any other way to bring these children if not through the government. I appeal to the government to do all within its powers to see their children are back,’ he said, speaking in the local Hausa language. Health worker Cidi Mohamed, 27, recalled hearing gunshots at the school on the night of the raid and then seeing the kidnappers leave with the children. ‘They put the children at the front and the back’ of motorcycles, he said. Global conflict monitoring group ACLED has recorded 42 incidents of violence targeting students in Nigeria this year, a decline from 71 in 2024. About 40 per cent of the abductions involved demands for ransom. ‘Fragmented bandit groups and other armed actors are the most common perpetrators in these abduction or kidnappings, while Islamist groups are far less frequently responsible for targeted violence against students,’ said ACLED.

{"title": "New Age | Zuma’s daughter quits S African parliament", "body": "A daughter of South Africa’s ex-president Jacob Zuma has resigned from parliament after claims she was involved in recruiting men to join Russian mercenaries in the Ukraine war, her party said Friday. Police last week said they were investigating allegations that Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, an MP in her father’s Umkhonto we Sizwe party, had lured 17 South African men to Russia ‘to fight in the Ukrainian war without their knowledge or consent’. The presidency said in early November it had been asked to bring home the 17 men who were allegedly ‘trapped’ in Donbas after being lured there ‘under the pretext of lucrative employment contracts’. ‘Comrade Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla has tendered her resignation from the National Assembly and all public representative responsibilities with immediate effect,’ MK party national chairperson Nkosinathi Nhleko said at a press briefing in the coastal city of Durban. ‘As far as we know, the resignation has got nothing to do with admission of guilt or the organisation finding her guilty,’ said another party official, Magasela Mzobe. ‘Umkhonto we Sizwe as a party is not involved in the Russian-Ukraine matter affecting these young people,’ Mzobe said. Zuma-Sambudla had responded to the accusations in a formal affidavit to the police, the party said. The allegations against her were made by one of her half-sisters in an affidavit asking for a formal investigation. Police said the case had been handed to a special unit that investigates crimes against the state to determine the charges. Reports in South African media said the men were allegedly sent to Russia for security training by the opposition MK party, which is headed by Zuma, South Africa’s president between 2009 and 2018. The war that started with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 has drawn in mercenaries on both sides, including from several African countries. Zuma-Sambudla is on trial on separate charges of inciting 2021 riots that left more than 350 people dead, to which she had pleaded not guilty. Jacob Zuma was sentenced to 15 months in jail after refusing to testify to a panel probing financial corruption and cronyism under his presidency. He served only two months before being released for health reasons and his sentence was later commuted by president Cyril Ramaphosa.

{"title": "New Age | Guinea-Bissau capital inches back to normal after coup", "body": "Life limped back to normal on Friday in the capital of volatile Guinea-Bissau after the west African nation’s fifth coup that came on the heels of presidential and parliamentary polls. The military appointed General Horta N’Tam, the army’s chief of staff, as the country’s new leader for a transition period of one year after Wednesday’s putsch. The takeover came just one day before authorities were due to announce the provisional results of the November 23 polls. There were vehicles and taxis along the main road from the port of the seaside capital Bissau to the presidential palace, AFP journalists said. There were some pedestrians as well. Security was eased in parts of the capital, but was in place at key locations. Surrounding areas of Bissau were more deserted, and there were few people in reopened markets, AFP journalists said. Sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea, Guinea-Bissau had already undergone four coups and a host of attempted takeovers since its independence from Portugal in 1974. Crippling poverty and chaotic administration have made the country a fertile ground for Latin American drug lords smuggling cocaine to Europe. Land, air and sea borders — which were all sealed off on Wednesday — were reportedly reopened, however. A nationwide curfew was lifted and the new authorities ordered the immediate reopening of markets, schools and private institutions. Guinea-Bissau’s president Umaro Sissoco Embalo left the country for Senegal after the coup. Opposition candidate Fernando Dias da Costa said he believed he won Sunday’s election and alleged Embalo — who has also claimed victory — had ‘organised’ the power grab to prevent him from taking office. Guinea-Bissau’s last presidential election in November 2019 was followed by a political crisis, with two rivals claiming to be head of state. That only ended in April 2020 when the west African regional bloc, ECOWAS, recognised Embalo as the winner.

{"title": "New Age | Gunmen kidnap dozens Nigerians across two states", "body": "Gunmen in Nigeria kidnapped nearly three dozen people across three attacks over the weekend, security sources said Monday, as authorities face renewed scrutiny over mass abductions. According to a security report prepared for the United Nations and seen by AFP, armed groups known as ‘bandits’ in northwest Nigeria kidnapped ‘at least 25 residents’ in twin assaults on the villages of Unguwar Tsamiya and Dabawa in Kano state. Kidnappings have been rare in Nigeria’s northern commercial hub. Separately, in northeastern Borno state, the epicentre of a long-running jihadist insurgency, nine onion farmers were kidnapped by suspected jihadists, militia commander Tijjani Ahmed said. Kidnappings for ransom by armed groups have plagued Nigeria since the 2014 abduction of 276 school girls in the town of Chibok by Boko Haram jihadists. A spate of kidnappings in recent weeks — involving hundreds of schoolchildren — has prompted the UN to warn of a ‘surge in mass abductions’. At the same time, Nigeria is under intense criticism from the United States, which has threatened military intervention over what it calls the mass killing of Christians. The Nigerian government and independent analysts reject Washington’s framing of the security situation in the country, home to myriad conflicts that kill across ethnic and religious lines. A wave of attacks in November saw some 400 people kidnapped, including more than 300 schoolchildren in two assaults, according to an AFP tally of major incidents. Statistics on kidnapping are hard to pin down, with many going unreported. But in the 12 months between July last year and June 2025, at least 4,722 people were kidnapped in 997 incidents, and at least 762 were killed, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence. During that period, ‘Nigeria’s kidnap-for-ransom crisis consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry’, said the Lagos-based security advisory firm. It said kidnappers obtained some 2.57 billion naira (around $1.66 million) in ransom. Motivated by money rather than ideology, bandits conduct kidnappings, extortion and looting in areas that have long suffered from little state or security presence. Government efforts have tried to strike peace deals with bandits. Critics say that while such accords have occasionally brought relief, they often result in the bandits keeping their arms and using areas where they have a truce as a base to attack neighbouring localities.

{"title": "New Age | HIV prevention shots begin in Africa", "body": "South Africa, Eswatini and Zambia on Monday began administering a groundbreaking new HIV-prevention injection in the drug’s first public rollouts in Africa, which has the world’s highest HIV burden. Lenacapavir, which is taken twice a year, has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV transmission by more than 99.9 per cent, making it functionally akin to a powerful vaccine. In South Africa, where one in five adults lives with HIV, a Wits University research unit oversaw the rollout as part of an initiative funded by Unitaid, the United Nations health agency. ‘The first individuals have begun using lenacapavir for HIV prevention in South Africa making it among the first real-world use of the six-monthly injectable in low- and middle-income countries,’ Unitaid said in a statement. It did not specify how many people received the first doses of the drug, which cost $28,000 per person a year in the United States. A broader national rollout is expected next year. Neighbouring Zambia and Eswatini received 1,000 doses last month as part of a US programme and launched the drug at World AIDS Day ceremonies on Monday. In Eswatini’s Hhukwini constituency, dozens lined up for the shot at a lively public event filled with song and dance. ‘Today marks a turning point in our national HIV response,’ said prime minister Russell Dlamini, adding that the injection ‘gives us fresh hope and a powerful tool to protect our citizens’. Under the US programme, manufacturer Gilead Sciences has agreed to provide lenacapavir at no profit to two million people in countries with a high HIV burden over three years. But Washington — at odds with Pretoria over several policy issues — will not provide doses to South Africa despite its participation in clinical trials. ‘Obviously, we encourage every country, especially countries like South Africa, that have significant means of their own to fund doses for their own population,’ Jeremy Lewin, a senior US State Department official, told reporters late last month. Critics say the US deliveries are far below the actual requirement and that the market price is out of reach for most people. Eastern and southern Africa account for about 52 percent of the 40.8 million people living with HIV worldwide, according to 2024 UNAIDS data. In Zambia alone, roughly 1.4 million people are living with HIV, with 30,000 new infections each year, according to the health ministry, while in Eswatini about 220,000 people are living with the virus in the tiny kingdom of 1.2 million. Generic versions of lenacapavir are expected to be available from 2027 at around $40 per year in more than 100 countries, through agreements by Unitaid and the Gates Foundation with Indian pharmaceutical companies. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, has been used for over a decade to prevent HIV, but its reliance on a daily pill has limited its impact on global infections.

{"title": "New Age | UN human rights chief fears new ‘atrocities’ in Sudan", "body": "UN Human Rights commissioner Volker Turk said Thursday he fears new ‘atrocities’ in Sudan amid intense fighting between the army and paramilitary forces in the battleground Kordofan region. Fighting has intensified across the three states that make up Kordofan as the Sudanese army seeks to keep the rival Rapid Support Forces and other groups away from a key road linking the capital Khartoum with the key Darfur region. The UN human rights council has already mandated one inquiry into alleged atrocities after the RSF seized the Darfur city of El-Fasher following an 18-month siege. The war that erupted in April 2023 has left tens of thousands dead and forced 12 million people to flee their homes, according to aid agencies. Turk made a new call for a ceasefire so aid can be sent into threatened towns and said he ‘feared another wave of atrocities in Sudan amid a surge in fierce fighting across the Kordofan region’ between the Sudanese army, the RSF and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), according to a statement released by his office. It added that since the RSF captured the Kordofan city of Bara on October 25, ‘the UN Human Rights Office has documented at least 269 civilian deaths from aerial strikes, artillery shelling, and summary executions.’ It said toll was probably ‘much higher’ as communications into the city was difficult. ‘There have also been reports of retaliatory killings, arbitrary detention, abductions, sexual violence and forced recruitment, including of children,’ Turk added. ‘It is truly shocking to see history repeating itself in Kordofan so soon after the horrific events in El Fasher,’ said Turk. The statement highlighted a November 3 drone attack on a tent where mourners had gathered in El Obeid, North Kordofan, reportedly killing 45 people, mostly women. Another November 29 drone strike by the army in Kauda, South Kordofan ‘reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least 48 people, most of them civilians’. The UN rights office said that Kadugli and Dilling in South Kordofan were at particular risk because they ‘have been besieged by the RSF and SPLM-N’, along with El Obeid in North Kordofan ‘which is partially surrounded by the RSF’. It said famine had been ‘confirmed’ in Kadugli. The intensified violence has seen more than 45,000 people fleeing their homes to seek safety within or outside the Kordofan region in the past month, it added.

{"title": "New Age | Trump, Rwanda, DR Congo leaders sign peace deal", "body": "US president Donald Trump and the leaders of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a peace deal Thursday, even as fresh violence raised questions about the accord to end one of Africa’s longest wars. Trump said the United States was also signing deals on critical minerals with the two countries as he hosted Paul Kagame, the long-time president of Rwanda, and Congolese president Felix Tshisekedi in Washington. ‘I think it’s going to be a great miracle,’ Trump said after the signing—held in a peace institute which his administration has just renamed after him. Speaking of the two leaders, he added: ‘They spent a lot of time killing each other, and now they are going to spend a lot of time hugging, holding hands and taking advantage of the United States of America economically, like every other country does.’ But the African leaders both took a more cautious tone, as fighting raged in eastern DRC where the M23 armed group—which the UN says is backed by Rwanda—has been gaining ground in recent weeks against Kinshasa’s forces. ‘There will be ups and downs on the road ahead, there is no doubt about it,’ said Kagame, whose allies have taken a decisive edge on the ground against his country’s turbulent neighbour. The DRC’s Tshisekedi called it the ‘beginning of a new path, a demanding path.’ Trump has boasted that the eastern DRC conflict, where hundreds of thousands of people have died over several decades, is among eight wars he has ended since he returned to office in January. The US president has made no secret of his desire to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Trump said the agreement will pave the way for the United States to gain access to critical minerals in both countries. The violence-torn eastern DRC in particular has reserves of many of the key ingredients in modern technologies such as electric cars. It is the latest in a series of deals in which the billionaire Republican has negotiated a stake for US firms to extract rare earth minerals, including in Ukraine. ‘We’re going take out some of the rare earth,’ Trump said. ‘And everybody’s going to make a lot of money.’ The signing comes more than five months after the countries’ foreign ministers also met Trump and announced another deal to end the conflict. The long-simmering conflict exploded in late January as the M23 captured the major cities of Goma and Bukavu. After the June agreement, the M23 -- which denies links to Rwanda—and the Kinshasa government pledged a ceasefire following mediation by US partner Qatar, but both sides have since accused the other of violations. Violence continued on the ground even on the day of the signing. An AFP journalist at the scene heard weapon fire ring out on the outskirts of Kamanyola, an M23-controlled town in South Kivu province near the borders with Rwanda and Burundi. ‘Many houses have been bombed, and there are many dead,’ said Rene Chubaka Kalembire, an administrative official in Kaziba, a town also under M23 control, on the eve of the signing. After several days of clashes around Kaziba, fighter jets bombarded the town again on Thursday morning, a local civil society representative who requested anonymity told AFP. Explosions could also be heard coming from the Bugarama border post in Rwanda across the border in neighbouring Burundi, with Rwandan police temporarily shutting the frontier post on Thursday. AFP was unable to obtain a verifiable toll from the fighting from independent sources. Local sources reported a massive build-up of M23 reinforcements, accompanied by armoured cars, in the high plateau of South Kivu. Passage through the mountainous region would allow its troops to encircle Uvira, the last major town in South Kivu to evade the M23’s capture. The Trump-brokered deal meanwhile comes as both countries are in talks with his administration on its priority of taking in migrants amid the president’s sweeping deportation drive.

{"title": "New Age | Tanzania ramping up post-poll crackdown, warns UN", "body": "Tanzania has stepped up its crackdown on opponents after contested elections in October that were marred by deadly violence, the United Nations warned Friday. Rights groups say more than 1,000 people were shot dead during three days of protests over elections on October 29 that the opposition and foreign observers describe as fraudulent. Tanzania’s president Samia Suluhu Hassan retained the presidency with 98 per cent of the vote, but the main opposition candidates were either jailed or disqualified. ‘The government has intensified a crackdown against opponents since the vote,’ UN human rights office spokesman Seif Magango told a press briefing in Geneva. ‘Reports indicate that since mid-November, dozens of individuals including academics, civil society actors and local political leaders have been detained, with several arrests allegedly carried out by unidentified armed personnel.’ Magango said hundreds were reportedly killed and more than 2,000 detained after demonstrations broke out following the elections. Five weeks on, Tanzanian authorities have still not disclosed information on how many people died, the circumstances of their deaths, or on reports of enforced disappearances, said Magango. ‘The continued absence of transparent information risks further eroding public trust and heightening tensions at a critical moment,’ he said, speaking from Nairobi. ‘We call for the immediate and unconditional release all those arbitrarily detained.’ He said that on Wednesday, police issued a blanket, nationwide ban on all Independence Day protests planned for Tuesday. ‘We call for the lifting of such an overbroad, disproportionate step,’ Magango said. Ahead of the planned protests, he reminded the Tanzanian authorities of their duty to ensure the rights to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly, and association. ‘We urge the government to instruct security forces to plan and implement their operations in a manner that allows Tanzanians to fully exercise these fundamental rights,’ he said. The Tanzanian government has set up an investigation into post-election violence. UN rights chief Volker Turk called for the probe had to adhere to international standards of impartiality, thoroughness and transparency, and provide robust protection against reprisals for all who engage with its work, said Magango.

{"title": "New Age | Unchecked mining waste taints DR Congo communities", "body": "Carrying her sore-pocked daughter across her decaying field, Helene Mvubu says she is one of thousands to have fallen victim to the toxic waste defiling the Democratic Republic of Congo’s mining capital. Global powers, notably China and the United States, are in a race to extract strategic minerals in the DRC, which supplies more than 70 per cent of the world’s cobalt, essential for making electric batteries and weaponry. But human rights groups say the mining operations are resulting in severe environmental damage in the mineral-rich African nation. Mvubu told AFP that she has for years suffered the consequences of flooding from contaminated water discharged by Congo Dongfang International Mining, a Chinese company that processes copper and cobalt ore in the outskirts of Lubumbashi, capital of the mineral-rich Katanga province in the southeastern DRC. ‘The food we prepare becomes bitter, our water sources are polluted,’ said the farmer as she walked across her plot, where the sugarcane has turned yellow with disease. Mvubu’s field is located directly within the path of runoff water from the CDM site, surrounded by an imposing concrete wall guarded by officers, on a mountain overlooking residential neighbourhoods. The extent of the pollution is unknown. But when it rains, red water can be seen gushing out from four drainage points under the enclosure. Residents and civil society groups interviewed by AFP accused CDM of taking advantage of rainy periods to discharge mining wastewater. At the beginning of November, thousands of cubic metres of the reddish water poured out from the Chinese company site over two days, despite no rainfall. Outrage over the flooding forced Congolese authorities to act by suspending the site’s activities and appointing an investigative commission—a rare move in a country where mining companies generally operate with impunity, often with the complicity of local administrations. ‘Everyone was surprised to see the waters flooding us even though it hadn’t rained,’ said resident Hortance Kiluba, as she busied herself washing her laundry. Joseph Kongolo, a member of the investigative commission and provincial coordinator of the National Human Rights Commission, said the Chinese company ‘was misled by the weather and opened the valves before the rains fell’ that would have otherwise hidden the flow. CDM, however, claimed that the November flood was caused by the accidental rupture of a retention basin. Several members of the investigative commission charge that pollution from the site dates back several years. But no study on the toxicity of the wastewater has yet been made public. Residents told AFP they have experienced harmful effects first-hand. Martiny, a vendor of fruits and vegetables at the local market, showed her ‘damaged’ hands and feet that she blamed on the exposure to ‘acidic’ water. The November flood, which inundated the market, also soaked her supply of dried fish, leaving it inedible. To calm the upset, CDM employees distributed masks and bottles of water to the community. The firm has also led the repairs of a stretch of road damaged by the waters. ‘It’s just for show,’ said a local chief, under the condition of anonymity, claiming that the firm also bribed officials to convince the public that the release of wastewater was accidental and not planned. A CDM representative denied any negligence on the company’s part when contacted by AFP, asserting that ‘the materials are processed on site’ and that ‘there could not have been any prior pollution’ before November. A subsidiary of Chinese multinational Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, CDM has long been in the crosshairs of human rights organisations. Hubert Tshiswaka, director general of the DRC’s Institute for Human Rights Research and member of the investigating commission, has for years fought to get CDM to comply with social and financial obligations—such as the payment of mining royalties—required by law. ‘Curiously, CDM obtained all the permits to set up on top of this hill,’ where rains naturally flow down to the neighbourhoods below, he said. Although the spill pointed to CDM’s ‘disregard for basic standards’ with ‘serious repercussions on the environment’, mining minister Louis Watum Kabamba admitted following the investigation that ‘responsibilities are shared’. ‘Our administration should have played its role,’ he said.

{"title": "New Age | Penguins starve off South Africa: study", "body": "Endangered penguins living off South Africa’s coast have likely starved en masse due to food shortages, a study said Friday, with some populations dropping by 95 per cent in just eight years. Fewer than 10,000 breeding pairs of the small, black and white African Penguin are left globally, according to scientists, and the species was listed as critically endangered last year by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Two of the most important breeding colonies near Cape Town had collapsed between 2004 and 2011, with some 62,000 birds estimated to have died, the study by the UK’s University of Exeter and the South African Department of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment said. In those eight years, sardine populations in South African waters—a main food source for penguins—were consistently below 25 per cent of their peak abundance, said co-author and biologist Richard Sherley. This drop in sardine stocks was due to fishing practices combined with environmental causes such as changes in water temperatures and salinity. This ‘appears to have caused severe food shortage for African penguins, leading to an estimated loss of about 62,000 breeding individuals’, Sherley said. The global population of the species had declined by nearly 80 per cent in the past 30 years, the scientists said. Conservationists say that at the current rate of population decrease, the bird could be extinct in the wild by 2035. For 10 years, authorities have imposed a commercial fishing ban around six penguin colonies, including Robben and Dassen islands, the two sites observed in the study. Other initiatives underway include artificial nests and creating new colonies. The birds are a strong attraction for tourists to South Africa, with thousands of people visiting colonies each year. But the pressure from tourism also disturbs the birds and causes enhanced stress.

{"title": "New Age | 12 dead in S Africa hostel shooting", "body": "Gunmen stormed a hostel in South Africa’s capital Pretoria on Saturday, killing a dozen people including a three‑year‑old child, at a site police said was illegally selling alcohol. The attack is the latest in a string of mass shootings that have shocked the crime‑weary country of 63 million people, which suffers one of the highest murder rates in the world. ‘I can confirm that a total of 25 people were shot,’ police spokeswoman Athlenda Mathe said. Ten had died at the scene in Saulsville township, 18 kilometres west of Pretoria, while two died in hospital, she said. The twelfth victim succumbed to injuries on Saturday afternoon. Three gunmen entered what Mathe described as an ‘illegal shebeen’ inside the hostel at around 4:30am local time and indiscriminately fired at a group of men who were drinking. ‘Shebeen’ is a word used to describe an informal bar or tavern. One 12-year-old boy and a 16-year-old female were also killed in the attack. ‘Quite an unfortunate incident. Police were only alerted to this incident at around 6 o’clock,’ said Mathe. Police said the motive was unknown and no arrests had been made, with a manhunt under way for the unidentified suspects. ‘We are having a serious challenge when it comes to these illegal and unlicensed liquor premises,’ Mathe said, adding that they are where most mass shootings occur. ‘Innocent people also get caught up in the crossfire,’ she told public broadcaster SABC.

{"title": "New Age | Fighting erupts in DR Congo after peace deal", "body": "Fresh fighting in eastern DR Congo on Friday forced hundreds to flee across the border into Rwanda, a day after a peace deal was signed in Washington. Thursday’s agreement was meant to stabilise the resource-rich east but it has had little visible effect on the ground so far, in an area plagued by conflict for 30 years. Fighters from the anti-government armed group M23 battled on Friday in South Kivu province with the Congolese army, backed by thousands of Burundian soldiers deployed alongside it. Both sides are fighting for control of the border town of Kamanyola—where the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Burundi meet. M23 is currently in control there. Detonations that shook buildings echoed throughout the morning near Kamanyola, an AFP journalist reported in Bugarama, a border post on the Rwandan side some two kilometres away. On Friday, the M23 accused the Burundian army of firing ‘without interruption’ into the DRC. A Burundian military source told AFP they were reinforcing their positions to ensure they were not overrun by M23 fighters and their Rwandan backers. ‘The fighting is intensifying,’ the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity. ‘There is a real risk the situation escalates. ‘We are bringing reinforcements to the front because this is a red line for Burundi.’ The source said his country could not accept it if ‘the terrorists of M23 and their Rwandan backers reach Uvira’, a city in DRC less than 30 kilometres from the Burundian capital Bujumbura. Lines of civilians fleeing the fighting crossed the border in the early hours watched by Rwandan police. ‘The bombs were exploding above the houses,’ said one witness, Immaculee Antoinette, from Ruhumba, near Kamanyola. ‘We were asked to remain locked inside our houses, but that seemed impossible.’ Hassan Shabani, an administrative official in Kamanyola, said ‘schools, hospitals and civilian homes’ were all shelled. On the Rwandan side, some residents were ‘scouring the hills from where the shots are coming, in small groups’, said local Farizi Bizimana. ‘The children and women are very scared and take refuge in houses when the gunfire becomes intense,’ she added. In January, M23 backed by Kigali and its army went on the offensive, capturing the major regional cities of Goma in North Kivu province and Bukavu in South Kivu. On Thursday in Washington, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan president Paul Kagame signed an agreement that their host, US president Donald Trump, dubbed a ‘miracle’.

{"title": "New Age | Witness in S Africa justice probe shot dead", "body": "South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said Saturday he was ‘appalled and saddened’ by the killing of a key witness in a police abuse case, pledging stronger safeguards for those who testify. Marius Van der Merwe was gunned down Friday night in front of his family, weeks after testifying against a municipal police chief at an inquiry into alleged criminality in the justice system. Codenamed Witness D, his identity had been kept secret until his death. ‘I am appalled and saddened by this attack on a former public servant who recently served the cause of justice and integrity,’ Ramaphosa said in a statement. ‘My thoughts are with the deeply traumatised family... they faced death in circumstances that suggest Van der Merwe’s brave testimony angered elements in our society who want to undermine the rule of law and set back the quest for truth and consequences in the fight against corruption.’ In November, Van der Merwe told the inquiry that suspended Ekurhuleni metropolitan police department deputy chief Julius Mkhwanazi ordered him to dispose of the body of a suspect who died in police custody in 2022. By then a former EMPD officer, he said he obeyed the order and dumped the body in a dam. Ramaphosa said South Africa must remain resolute in ending corruption and vowed to intensify efforts to safeguard witnesses. ‘As government, we will redouble our efforts to protect whistle-blowers, including witnesses... as they serve the nation with bravery in the face of criminal threats,’ he said. Amnesty International South Africa also condemned the killing, warning that it could deter future witnesses who fear reprisals. ‘This is not only an attack on an individual but on justice and accountability in South Africa,’ the rights group said. The judicial commission, led by former Constitutional Court judge Mbuyiseli Madlanga, was set up in July after a provincial police chief accused police minister Senzo Mchunu and other senior officials of blocking probes into politically motivated killings. Ramaphosa later suspended Mchunu, who was alleged to have dismantled a team probing the murders to shield politically connected figures. Both Mchunu and Mkhwanazi have appeared before the commission and deny wrongdoing.

{"title": "New Age | Drone strikes on Sudan kindergarten, hospital kill dozens", "body": "A recent paramilitary drone attack on the army-held town of Kalogi in Sudan’s South Kordofan state hit a kindergarten and a hospital, killing dozens of civilians including children, a local official told AFP on Sunday. The attack, which took place on Thursday, involved three strikes, ‘first a kindergarten, then a hospital and a third time as people tried to rescue the children’, Essam al-Din al-Sayed, head of the Kalogi administrative unit, told AFP using a Starlink satellite internet connection. He blamed the assault on the Rapid Support Forces and their ally, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North faction led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, which controls much of South Kordofan and parts of Blue Nile state. Since April 2023, the army and the paramilitary RSF have been locked in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million. Independent verification in Kordofan remains difficult due to spotty communications, restricted access and ongoing insecurity. The UN children’s agency said the attack killed more than 10 children aged between five and seven, while the army-aligned foreign ministry put the overall death toll at 79, including 43 children. ‘Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children’s rights,’ UNICEF Representative for Sudan Sheldon Yett, said in a statement on Friday, urging all sides to stop their attacks and allow humanitarian aid. Following their late-October capture of El-Fasher—the army’s last stronghold in western Sudan—the RSF has pushed eastward into the oil-rich Kordofan region, divided into three states. Reports of mass killings, sexual violence, looting and abductions followed El-Fasher’s fall. UN Human Rights commissioner Volker Turk said on Thursday he ‘feared another wave of atrocities in Sudan amid a surge in fierce fighting’ in Kordofan. ‘It is truly shocking to see history repeating itself in Kordofan so soon after the horrific events in El Fasher.’ Since the RSF captured the North Kordofan city of Bara on October 25, the UN said it had documented at least 269 civilians killed by aerial strikes, artillery shelling or in summary executions. A drone strike by the army in Kauda—the SPLM-N faction stronghold in South Kordofan—killed at least 48 people last week, according to the UN. More than 40,000 people have fled Kordofan in the past month, according to the UN. Analysts say the RSF offensive aims to break the army’s final defensive arc around central Sudan and set the stage for attempts to retake major cities, including the capital Khartoum. Thursday’s attack in Kalogi came as the army and the RSF traded accusations over a series of drone attacks across the country. On Friday, the RSF accused the army of carrying out a drone strike on the Adre border crossing with Chad, a key humanitarian and commercial route, alleging that the army wanted to block aid. The military has not commented on that allegation. Local sources, speaking anonymously to AFP because they were not authorised to brief the media, attributed an explosion at Adre on Friday to transport vehicles catching fire after a petrol canister detonated. Satellite imagery and fire monitoring data, verified by AFP, showed no visible signs of smoke or fire in Adre on Thursday or Friday. The army has accused the United Arab Emirates of supplying the RSF through Chad, accusations that UN experts have described as credible. Abu Dhabi has always denied providing support to the RSF. In North Darfur, the World Food Programme also reported an attack last Thursday on one of its trucks near the town of Hamra El-Sheikh. The truck, part of a 39-vehicle convoy delivering food to families displaced from El-Fasher to Tawila, about 70 kilometres west, had its cabin destroyed while the driver was seriously injured, the WFP said.

{"title": "New Age | UN accuse Rwandan army of ‘summary executions’ in Congo", "body": "Rwanda’s army and the M23 armed group it supports have carried out executions and forced mass displacements of people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, UN experts said in a report seen Sunday by AFP. The report—an evaluation written up every six months by experts mandated by the UN Security Council—is to be made public soon. Its information follows a peace deal signed Thursday in Washington by the leaders of the DRC and Rwanda which has failed to quell fighting in the resource-rich DRC that has been plagued by conflict for 30 years. Violence in that region intensified this year, after the M23 group seized the city of Goma in January. In their latest report, UN experts say the Rwandan Defence Force directly took part in M23 operations targeting an armed rebel group in eastern DRC called the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. The M23 and Rwandan soldiers committed ‘summary executions, arrests and arbitrary detentions’, and caused the mass displacement of populations, the experts’ report said. During those operations, Rwandan soldiers and the M23 ‘systematically’ destroyed and torched homes belonging to FDLR members, it said, adding that there was ‘deliberate and systematic’ targeting of the FDLR and civilians deemed to support it, many of them Hutus. The report said there were at least 6,000 to 7,000 RDF soldiers, comprising two brigades and two special-operations battalions, still deployed in the DRC provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu. Rwanda and the M23 have repeatedly denied being linked. The UN experts, however, have already underlined the decisive role Rwanda has played in eastern DRC and in the operation to seize Goma. Their report identified the M23 as the principal perpetrator of human rights violations documented by the UN between April and October in the DRC. It attributed 45 per cent of the recorded summary executions to the M23 group, which it said conducted forced recruitment in all areas under its control. The UN experts’ report also said that the DRC government continued to cooperate with the FDLR, which it has pledged to neutralise under the Washington peace accord.

{"title": "New Age | Benin govt foils coup attempt", "body": "Benin’s government on Sunday said that it had thwarted an attempted coup, after a group of soldiers announced on state television that they had ousted president Patrice Talon. West Africa has experienced a number of coups in recent years, including in Benin’s northern neighbours Niger and Burkina Faso, as well as Mali, Guinea and, most recently, Guinea-Bissau. Talon, a 67-year-old former businessman dubbed the ‘cotton king of Cotonou’, is due to hand over power in April next year after 10 years in office marked by solid economic growth but also a surge in jihadist violence. Early on Sunday, soldiers calling themselves the ‘Military Committee for Refoundation’, said on state television that they had met and decided that ‘Mr Patrice Talon is removed from office as president of the republic’. But shortly after the announcement, a source close to Talon told AFP the president was safe and condemned the coup plotters as ‘a small group of people who only control the television’. ‘The regular army is regaining control. The city [Cotonou] and the country are completely secure,’ they said. ‘It’s just a matter of time before everything returns to normal. The clean-up is progressing well.’ On the streets of Cotonou, the situation remained unclear by midday on Sunday. AFP correspondents reported hearing gunfire while soldiers blocked access to the presidential offices, even as residents elsewhere went about their business. Interior minister Alassane Seidou described the soldiers’ announcement as ‘a mutiny’ aimed at ‘destabilising the country and its institutions’. ‘Faced with this situation, the Beninese Armed Forces and their leadership maintained control of the situation and foiled the attempt,’ he added. On television, eight soldiers with assault rifles, wearing berets of various colours and calling themselves the ‘Military Committee for Refoundation’, proclaimed a lieutenant colonel ‘president of the CMR’. They justified the attempted power grab by citing the ‘continuous deterioration of the security situation in northern Benin’, the ‘neglect of soldiers killed in action and their families left to fend for themselves,’ as well as ‘unjust promotions at the expense of the most deserving’. A military source confirmed that the situation was ‘under control’ and the coup plotters had not taken either Talon’s residence or the presidential offices. An AFP journalist in the economic capital said soldiers were blocking access to the presidency and state television. Access to several other areas, including the five-star Sofitel in Cotonou and districts housing international institutions, were also blocked. But there was no military presence reported at the airport and the rest of the city. The Economic Community of West African States, of which Benin is a member, called the soldiers’ actions ‘unconstitutional’ and a ‘subversion of the will of the Beninese people’. Benin’s political history has been marked by several coups and attempted coups since its independence from France in 1960. Talon, who came to power in 2016, is due to reach the end of his second term in 2026, the maximum allowed by the constitution. The main opposition party has been excluded from the race to succeed him, and instead the ruling party will vie for power against a so-called ‘moderate’ opposition. Talon has been praised for bringing economic development to Benin but is regularly accused by his critics of authoritarianism.

{"title": "New Age | Wounded civilians escape DRC fighting", "body": "Some 20 wounded civilians including children were evacuated between Saturday and Sunday from eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Red Cross said, as fighting raged despite an accord signed between Kinshasa and Kigali. DRC president Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame ratified an agreement in Washington Thursday that was intended to restore peace in eastern Congo, but which so far has had little effect on the ground. After a period of relative stability on the front since March, fighting has intensified again since Monday in South Kivu province, according to security and military sources. The clashes pit M23 troops, still supported by Kigali, against the Congolese army, backed by thousands of soldiers from neighboring Burundi, in a region rich in natural resources that has been fought over for three decades. According to a Red Cross statement, ‘the humanitarian situation in South Kivu has deteriorated sharply, following the intensification of violent fighting, resulting in numerous injuries and massive population displacements.’ The organisation said 21 wounded, including seven children, had been evacuated to the hospital in Uvira since Saturday. On Sunday, fighting continued north of Uvira, the last major town in the province not controlled by M23 and which faces Burundi’s economic capital Bujumbura across Lake Tanganyika. At least 20 Burundian soldiers have died fighting in the DRC since Monday, according to Burundian military sources.

Local official Essam al-Din al-Sayed, head of the Kalogi administrative unit, told AFP that Thursday’s paramilitary drone attack on the army-held town hit ‘first a kindergarten, then a hospital and a third time as people tried to rescue the children’. Since April 2023, Sudan’s regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced nearly 12 million. Following their late-October capture of El-Fasher—the army’s last stronghold in western Sudan—the RSF have pushed eastward into the oil-rich Kordofan region, divided into three states. The strikes ‘hit a kindergarten and, at least three times, the nearby Kalogi Rural Hospital, killing 114 people, including 63 children, and injuring 35 people,’ WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X, citing the UN health agency’s Attacks on Health Care monitoring system. Survivors from Thursday’s attack were moved to Abu Jebaiha Hospital in South Kordofan for treatment, while urgent calls have gone out for blood donations and other medical support, Tedros said. ‘Disturbingly, paramedics and responders came under attack as they tried to move the injured from the kindergarten to the hospital,’ he said. ‘WHO deplores these senseless attacks on civilians and health facilities, and calls again for an end to the violence, and increased access to humanitarian aid, including health. ‘Sudanese have suffered far too much. Ceasefire now!’ While the WHO counts and verifies attacks on health care, it does not attribute blame as it is not an investigation agency. The WHO says health care facilities and patients were hit in the attacks, which took place between 6:00 am and noon. Its record of the incident lists violence with heavy weapons, obstruction to health care delivery and ‘Psychological violence/threat of violence/intimidation’. In total, the WHO has recorded 63 attacks on health care in Sudan this year, resulting in 1,611 deaths and 259 injuries. Of those attacks, 52 impacted personnel, 45 impacted facilities and 32 impacted patients. UN chief Antonio Guterres was ‘appalled’ by reports of Thursday’s fatal attack, his spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in New York. ‘The secretary-general calls on all states with influence over the parties to take immediate action and use their leverage to compel an immediate halt to the fighting and stop the arms flows that are fuelling the conflict,’ he said.

{"title": "New Age | Benin hunts soldiers behind failed coup", "body": "Benin’s military was Monday searching for fugitive soldiers behind a foiled coup attempt on the weekend that left several dead as other west African countries mobilised to offer military support. At least a dozen plotters had been arrested and by Monday all hostages, including high-ranking officers, had been released, according to loyalist military sources. The country’s economic capital Cotonou was calm and traffic had returned to normal by Monday afternoon, AFP journalists saw — a day after a group of soldiers had announced on national television they had ousted the president. President Patrice Talon made his own TV appearance late Sunday, assuring the country that the situation was ‘completely under control’. Talon, 67, is due to hand over the reins of power in April after the maximum-allowed two terms leading Benin, which in recent years has been hit by jihadist violence in the north. The Sunday coup attempt follows a spate of successful military takeovers in the region, including in Benin’s northern neighbours Niger and Burkina Faso, as well as Mali, Guinea and, last month, Guinea-Bissau. ‘Violent clashes’ erupted between the coup plotters and the Republican Guard at Talon’s Cotonou residence, resulting in ‘casualties on both sides’, according to the government. The dead included the wife of the president’s military chief of staff General Bertin Bada. Benin called on the swift help of neighbouring Nigeria, which said late Sunday it had carried out military strikes on Cotonou and deployed troops. West African regional bloc ECOWAS has also announced military support for Benin, but a meeting scheduled to take place in Abidjan on Monday was cancelled. The bloc had threatened intervention during Niger’s 2023 coup but ultimately did not act. A military source said on Monday that they were ‘not in a position to say how many’ people were implicated in the coup attempt, ‘nor how many are currently on the run’, but it was ‘presumed that many of them have fled’ to the countryside. ‘The search continues,’ the source said, adding that ‘there have been arrests’. Other sources said there had been around a dozen arrests, but that coup leader Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Tigri was on the run. All hostages have meanwhile been ‘released’, according to the military source. Two senior Beninese officers, Chief of army staff Abou Issa and army chief Colonel Faizou Gomina, had been taken hostage but were released overnight. In his address late Sunday, Talon said the country had ‘stood firm’ and ‘cleared the last pockets of resistance’. In Cotonou, the road to the presidential residence was closed Monday afternoon, and military tanks were seen elsewhere in the city. The Economic Community of West African States said troops from Ghana, Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Sierra Leone were being deployed to Benin to help the government ‘preserve constitutional order’. The regional bloc, along with the United Nations, former colonial power France and the African Union, has condemned the coup attempt. Under Benin’s constitution, Talon is not permitted to run for a third term but his designated successor, finance minister Romuald Wadagni, is considered a favourite for the presidential election in April. The main opposition Democrats party has been excluded from the ballot on the grounds that its candidate did not have sufficient sponsors. In a statement seen by AFP on Monday, the party said it ‘rejects any seizure of power by force and strongly condemns these acts that do not honour our country’. ‘This heinous and tragic event once again highlights the need for all political actors in our country to prioritise dialogue,’ it stated. Although hailed for spurring economic growth, Talon is accused by critics of authoritarianism in a country once praised for its democratic dynamism. Benin’s political history has been marked by several coups and attempted coups since its independence from France in 1960.

The Fes prosecutor’s office said in a statement, there had been a family celebration in one of the buildings at the time of the collapse while the other was unoccupied. The prosecutor’s office added an investigation had been opened to ‘determine the real causes’ of the incident. The two adjacent structures collapsed overnight in the major northern city’s Al-Moustakbal neighbourhood, in the Al-Massira area, according to MAP. Images from the pre-dawn scene showed first responders carrying a corpse in a grey body bag to waiting emergency vehicles, as residents gathered to watch the rescue efforts. Other workers with jackhammers and pickaxes tried to dig through the rubble, at times with the help of mechanical excavators. Mohamed, a local resident interviewed by outlet Le 360, said the construction standards for the buildings may not have been observed when the occupants built on the plots they received there in 2007 as part of a resettlement programme. ‘After 2007, everyone built as they wished,’ he said. TelQuel magazine reported that the homes ‘were not subject to oversight’, adding that some tenants may have ‘not respected development plans’. Local authorities have indicated that the toll could rise in the coming hours. MAP said that safety officials had conducted ‘necessary preventative measures’, including securing the surrounding area and evacuating neighbouring buildings. The agency reported the injured were taken to Fes’s University Hospital Centre. The accident was the deadliest of its kind in a decade. In 2014, three buildings in the western city of Casablanca collapsed, killing 23 people. In 2016, there were two deadly building collapses within the span of a week. One was a home in the western city of Marrakech where two children were killed, while the other was a four-storey building that killed four people and injured two dozen more. In February of last year, five people died in the collapse of a house in Fes’s old city. Last May in Fes, nine people died when a residential building collapsed. The structure had been listed as at risk of collapse and its occupants had been ordered to evacuate, a local authority source said at the time.

{"title": "New Age | US to respond to Rwanda’s DRC violation: Rubio", "body": "Top US diplomat Marco Rubio said Saturday that Rwanda had clearly violated the peace agreement it signed with the Democratic Republic of Congo last week in Washington and vowed unspecified ‘action’ in response. The Rwandan-backed M23 armed group advanced in eastern DRC and seized the key border city of Uvira, just days after the two nations’ leaders and US president Donald Trump signed the ‘Washington Accords’ on December 4. ‘Rwanda’s actions in eastern DRC are a clear violation of the Washington Accords signed by President Trump, and the United States will take action to ensure promises made to the President are kept,’ Secretary of State Rubio wrote on X. The capture of Uvira, along the border with Burundi, has raised fears of the conflict breaking out into a regional war. Part of an offensive launched at the beginning of December in South Kivu province, the armed group’s takeover follows its capture earlier this year of Goma and Bukavu, other major cities in the DRC’s mineral-rich east. Trump had frequently touted the DRC conflict as one of several wars he helped end since returning to the White House. On Friday, US ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz accused Rwanda of ‘leading the region toward more instability and toward war.’ ‘The Rwandan defence forces have provided materiel, logistics and training support to M23 as well as fighting alongside M23 in DRC with roughly 5,000 to 7,000 troops,’ not including possible reinforcements during the latest offensive, Waltz told the UN Security Council. The Rwandan firepower has included surface-to-air missiles, drones and artillery, he added. Since taking up arms again in 2021, the M23 has seized swathes of territory, displacing tens of thousands and leading to a spiraling humanitarian crisis. Earlier, UN experts said Rwanda’s army and the M23 had carried out summary executions and forced mass displacements of people.

{"title": "New Age | Benin demo slams coup attempt", "body": "Hundreds of mainly young people gathered in Benin’s capital Cotonou on Saturday to decry last Sunday’s abortive coup. Participants waving national flags and with raised fists brandished slogans such as ‘Never Again’ as they demanded peace, stability and respect for constitutional order. ‘We are attached to a certain kind of democracy, which means power has to be won through elections,’ said Youssouf Issa, an entrepreneur who will stand in legislatives polls slated for January. Last Sunday, mutineers claimed on state television to have overthrown President Patrice Talon, but hours later the army thwarted the putsch with help from Nigeria and France. Elias Satowakou, known as Gros Griot and with a large following on social media, recalled Benin’s political past, which saw several coups in the 1960s and 70s. ‘Our parents learned from this. We fear that coups will lead to total destruction and push us back 30 years,’ he said. ‘The message is also for the countries in the region—never again military coups,’ warned Dieudonne N’Boa, a political science student, who was holding the national flag. West Africa has been shaken by political instability since the beginning of the decade with Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea and Guinea-Bissau all undergoing coups since 2020. ‘I was very afraid my country would descend into instability. It is important to preserve the gains of the last ten years,’ said another protester, Fridaousse Iffabi. Talon, who will step down after two terms when his country holds presidential polls in April, has been fulsomely praised for Benin’s economic development over the past decade. But he is also accused by his detractors of treating the opposition repressively. His chosen successor, finance minister Romuald Wadagni, is expected to win easily given that the main opposition party is barred from standing after obtaining an insufficient number of endorsements. After the attempted coup, Benin issued an international arrest warrant for Kemi Seba, a pan-Africanist and anti-Western figure, for ‘justifying crimes against state security and inciting rebellion.’ Former Beninese defence minister Candide Azannai, a key opposition figure, has meanwhile been taken into custody on charges of ‘conspiracy against state authority and incitement to rebellion,’ a judicial source reported on Saturday. The abortive coup leader, Lieutenant Colonel Pascal Tigri, remains at large along with several associates.

{"title": "New Age | Flash flood kills dozens in Morocco town", "body": "A flash flood in a Moroccan coastal town killed at least 37, local officials said Monday, as search and rescue operations continued. Drought-hit Morocco often faces severe weather, but Sunday’s flooding in Safi is already the deadliest such disaster in at least a decade. A muddy torrent swept cars and bins from the streets in Safi, which is around 300 kilometres south of the capital Rabat. Fourteen survivors are being treated at Mohammed V hospital in the town, and two of them are in intensive care, according to local officials updating the overnight toll. Schools have been closed for at least three days and mud and debris clog the streets. ‘I’ve lost all my clothes. Only my neighbour gave me some to cover myself. I have nothing left. I’ve lost everything,’ one victim said. At least 70 homes and businesses in the historic town centre were flooded and 55-year-old shopkeeper Abdelkader Mezraoui said the retail economy had been devastated. ‘Jewelry store owners have lost all their stock... and the same goes for clothing store owners,’ he said, calling for official compensation to save businesses. Late on Sunday, the rescuer Azzedine Kattane had said about the strong ‘psychological impact of the tragedy’ in light of the large number of victims. As the waters receded, they left behind a landscape of mud and overturned cars. Onlookers watched Civil Protection units and local residents working to clear debris. Morocco is struggling with a severe drought for the seventh consecutive year, and last year was the North African kingdom’s hottest on record. Climate change has made storms more intense, because a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and warmer seas can turbocharge weather systems. Flash floods killed hundreds in Morocco in 1995 and scores in 2002.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan general ready to talk to Trump for peace", "body": "Sudan’s de facto leader, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, is ready to work with US President Donald Trump to resolve the conflict splitting his country, the foreign ministry said on Tuesday. The ministry released a statement after the army chief visited Riyadh as a guest of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who recently presented Trump with a proposed Sudan peace plan during a Washington visit. According to Sudan’s statement, Burhan hailed Trump’s ‘determination to engage in efforts to achieve peace and end the war in the country, with the participation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. ‘He affirmed Sudan’s keenness to work with President Trump, his secretary of state, and his envoy for peace in Sudan to achieve this unquestionably noble goal,’ it said, referring to Marco Rubio and US envoy Massad Boulos. International peace efforts led by mediators from the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have been at a standstill since Burhan rejected Boulos’s last suggested framework. The general accused the mediators of taking sides and notably to have adopted talking points from the UAE, who is accused of arming and supporting his foes in the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The UAE regularly denies sending weapons, fuel and men to the RSF, despite evidence from independent investigations and international reports. The RSF says it supports the international ceasefire plan, but heavy fighting continues, notably in the southern region of Kordofan. For the moment, no new date has been announced for talks, neither under the US-led mediators nor a parallel United Nations’ led effort. Since April 2023, Sudan has been gripped by a war pitting the army, which controls the north and east of the country, against the RSF, dominant in the west and certain areas of the south. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people, uprooted millions and triggered what the UN calls ‘the world’s worst humanitarian crisis’.

{"title": "New Age | RSF destroying evidence of atrocities in Sudan", "body": "Sudan’s paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group has undertaken systematic mass killing and body disposal in the overrun Darfur city of El-Fasher, a new report has found. Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab, which has used satellite imagery to monitor atrocities since the RSF’s war with the army began, said on Tuesday the group ‘destroyed and concealed evidence of its widespread mass killings’ in the North Darfur state capital. The RSF’s violent takeover of the army’s last holdout position in the Darfur region in October led to international outrage over reports of summary executions, systematic rape and mass detention. The HRL said that in the aftermath of the takeover, it had identified 150 clusters of objects consistent with human remains. Dozens were consistent with reports of execution-style killings, and dozens more with reports of the RSF killing civilians as they fled. Within a month, nearly 60 of those clusters were no longer visible, while eight earth disturbances appeared near the sites of mass killing, the HRL said. It said the disturbances were not consistent with civilian burial practices. ‘Largescale and systematic mass killing and body disposal has occurred,’ the report determined, estimating the death toll in the city to be in the tens of thousands. Aid groups and the UN have repeatedly demanded safe access to El-Fasher, where communications remain cut and an estimated tens of thousands of survivors are trapped, many detained by the RSF. There is no confirmed death toll from the Sudan war which began in April 2023, with estimates at more than 1,50,000. Sudan’s de facto leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan leads the army while the RSF is headed by his former deputy, Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. The fighting has also displaced millions of people, and created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. Efforts to end the war have repeatedly faltered. Hopes for a breakthrough in talks were rekindled last month when US president Donald Trump said he would help end the conflict after Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman urged him to intervene during a visit to Washington. But movement since has been slow, with the United Nations saying last week it was working to bring the two sides to ‘technical-level talks’.

{"title": "New Age | Outages in Sudan after major drone attack hits power plant", "body": "Sudan paramilitaries launched a large-scale drone attack in the east on Thursday, a military source said, with strikes hitting a key power station, causing major outages and killing three. Since April 2023, Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions more and devastated infrastructure. ‘We’ve been without power since 2:00am (0000 GMT),’ Abdel Rahim al-Amin, an official in Port Sudan, said. ‘We hope it will be restored soon.’ The attacks ‘led to power outages in several states’, the national electricity company stated. In recent months the RSF has been accused of launching drone attacks on vast areas controlled by the army, targeting civilian infrastructure and causing power cuts affecting millions. ‘At dawn this morning, the militia launched 35 drones against the cities of Atbara, Al-Damer and Berber in River Nile State, targeting civilian infrastructure,’ a military source told AFP on condition of anonymity, attributing the strikes to the RSF. Strikes on Thursday in government-controlled Atbara in River Nile State targeted transformers at the Al-Muqrin power station, the national electricity company said, after witnesses reported flames and smoke was seen rising above the city. An official at the power plant said an initial strike targeted the plant in Atbara overnight. A second strike hit rescue workers, killing two and injuring another person. The River Nile State government in a statement confirmed two rescue workers were killed, saying that they were killed ‘by militias who have no respect for human life’. The damaged power station is a strategic hub in the Sudanese electricity grid, receiving power generated by the Merowe Dam — the country’s largest source of hydroelectric energy — before its redistribution to other areas. According to witnesses, power outages have spread to several states, including those along the Nile and the Red Sea — where Port Sudan, the interim seat of the pro-military government, is located. Emergency Lawyers, an NGO which documents the atrocities of the conflict, reported airstrikes in Atbara that hit civilian homes, killing a young girl and injuring four. The fire at the power station was still burning on Thursday morning, the Sudan Electricity Company said. The RSF has not commented on the incident, though it has been using long-range drones to strike army-held areas since it lost control of the capital. Last month explosions were heard in Atbara, which is around 300 kilometres north of Khartoum. The war in Sudan has created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations. It prompted global outcry in October, as reports of mass atrocities emerged after the RSF seized the city of El-Fasher — the army’s last stronghold in the western Darfur region — following a bitter 18-month siege. Since then, the violence has spread to the neighbouring region of Kordofan in the south, where more than 50,000 civilians have been displaced, according to the International Organisation for Migration. The UN also said on Thursday that more than 1,000 civilians were killed during three days of attacks by the RSF on the Zamzam displacement camp in April, demanding a war crimes investigation. Sudan’s army chief and de facto leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan was expected in Cairo on Thursday ‘to discuss ways to resolve the Sudanese crisis’, the spokesman for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said. Hopes for a breakthrough in talks on Sudan’s war were rekindled last month when US president Donald Trump said he would help end the conflict after Prince Mohammed urged him to intervene during a visit to Washington. Before the power outages on Thursday, Khartoum had seen relative calm since the regular army regained control this year, even as the RSF continues to mount attacks in several regions.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan PM heads to NY for UN talks", "body": "Sudan’s prime minister Kamil Idris left for New York Saturday to meet the UN chief and other officials and discuss humanitarian access and a possible ceasefire, two government sources said. The trip comes as fighting between Sudan’s army and the Rapid Support Forces, which erupted in April 2023, intensifies in southern Kordofan, raising fears of new atrocities similar to those reported in the city of El-Fasher in late October. Reports of mass killings, rape and abductions followed the RSF’s capture of the army’s last stronghold in the western Darfur region. A Sudanese government source told AFP, on condition of anonymity, that Idris is expected to meet UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres, with the aim of ‘putting an end to the worsening humanitarian crisis’ in Sudan. Idris’s adviser Mohamed Abdel Qader also told AFP the talks would focus on ‘facilitating aid access’ and reaffirm the government’s commitment to a roadmap handed over to the UN, including a ‘conditional ceasefire linked to the withdrawal of the RSF from areas and cities it occupies’. Earlier this month, Guterres said the United Nations was preparing talks with both sides in Geneva, but without specifying a date. Renewed hopes for diplomacy emerged last month when US President Donald Trump pledged to help end the conflict after Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Prince Mohammed bin Salman, urged him to intervene. Sudan’s army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said last week he was ready to work with Trump to resolve the conflict, following talks in Riyadh with Prince Mohammed. Saudi Arabia is part of a four-nation mediation group, alongside the United States, United Arab Emirates and Egypt, that has stepped up diplomatic efforts in recent months. Talks have stalled, however, after Burhan accused the mediators of bias towards the UAE. Sudan’s army-aligned government has accused Abu Dhabi of arming and supporting the RSF—allegations the UAE has repeatedly denied. The RSF says it supports the international ceasefire plan, but heavy fighting continues, notably in Kordofan. Egypt, a key ally of Sudan’s army, warned on Thursday that escalating violence ‘directly affects Egyptian national security’ and stressed that preserving Sudanese state institutions remains a ‘red line’.

{"title": "New Age | UN votes to extend DR Congo mission", "body": "The UN Security Council voted unanimously Friday to extend the deployment of the UN’s peacekeeping mission in Democratic Republic of Congo by one year as Washington called for Rwanda and M23 forces to respect a regional peace deal. The MONUSCO mission of 11,500 military personnel is one of the blue helmet missions endorsed by the United States which has sought to cut back on the body’s spending on deployments under president Donald Trump. The resolution extends ‘until December 20, 2026 the mandate of MONUSCO in the DRC’ and comes in the wake of the fall of the major Congolese cities of Goma in January and Bukavu in February to the anti-government M23. Washington says the M23 is backed by Rwanda. On December 10 the group occupied Uvira, a DRC city of several hundred thousand people that allowed it to control the land border with Burundi and cut the DRC off from military support from its neighbour. The US representative at Friday’s meeting, Jennifer Locetta, said ‘negotiations to renew the MONUSCO mandate were yet again disrupted by Rwandan and M23 efforts to sabotage a viable peace process.’ Earlier this month, the Congolese and Rwandan leaders signed a peace deal in Washington—but the fall of Uvira threatened to upend that landmark agreement. On Wednesday, the M23 said it had begun pulling out of the city and called on ‘mediators and other partners to ensure Uvira is protected from violence, reprisals and remilitarisation.’ Local and security sources reported that troops had moved towards the north of the city. Early Thursday, M23 police and plain-clothed agents were still seen in the streets and at strategic points, according to local sources. On Tuesday, two Burundian officials estimated that at least 85,000 people had fled the DRC in recent weeks to seek refuge in Burundi. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has said it expects 90,000 new arrivals and published a photo showing dozens of people camping under trees, without any infrastructure to accommodate them.

{"title": "New Age | Drone attack on Sudan’s Darfur market kills 10", "body": "A drone attack on a busy market in Sudan’s North Darfur state killed 10 people over the weekend, first responders said, without saying who was responsible. The attack comes as fighting intensified elsewhere in the country, leading aid workers to be evacuated on Sunday from Kadugli, a besieged, famine-hit city in the south. Since April 2023, Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in a conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced nearly 12 million and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis. The North Darfur Emergency Rooms Council, one of hundreds of volunteer groups coordinating aid across Sudan, said a drone strike hit Al-Harra market in the RSF-controlled town of Malha on Saturday. The council did not identify who carried out the attack, which it said had sparked ‘fire in shops and caused extensive material damage’. There was no immediate comment from either the Sudanese army or the RSF. The war’s current epicentre is South Kordofan and clashes have escalated in Kadugli, the state capital, where a drone attack last week killed eight people as they attempted to flee the army-controlled city. A source from a humanitarian organisation operating in Kadugli said on Sunday that humanitarian groups had ‘evacuated all their workers’ from the city due to security conditions. The evacuation followed the United Nations’ decision to relocate its logistics hub from Kadugli, the source said on condition of anonymity, without specifying where the staff had gone. Kadugli and nearby Dilling have been besieged by paramilitary forces since the war erupted. Last week, the RSF claimed control of the Brno area, a key defensive line on the road connecting Kadugli to Dilling. After dislodging the army in October from the western city of El-Fasher — its last stronghold in the Darfur region — the RSF has shifted its focus to resource-rich Kordofan, a strategic crossroads linking army-held northern and eastern territories with RSF-held Darfur in the west. Communications in the area have been cut, and the United Nations declared a famine in Kadugli last month. Residents have been forced to forage for food in nearby forests, according to accounts gathered by AFP. The conflict has effectively split Sudan in two: the army controls the north, east and centre while the RSF dominates all five state capitals in Darfur and, with its allies, parts of the south.

The group were going to an event to mark the birth of Prophet Mohammed, when their vehicle was ‘intercepted’, said the report which added that police have launched an investigation into the attack. It is the latest in a string of mass kidnappings in recent weeks, which has put an uncomfortable international spotlight on Nigeria’s grim security situation. The abductions occurred on the same day authorities secured the release of 130 schoolchildren — the last batch of more than 250 snatched from their Catholic boarding school in north-central Niger state a month ago. The recent spate of kidnappings — mainly involving hundreds of schoolchildren — has prompted the UN to warn of a ‘surge in mass abductions’. Scores of other people have been seized from places of worship in separate raids. Nigeria is under intense criticism from the United States, which has threatened military intervention over what it calls the mass killing of Christians. The Nigerian government and independent analysts reject Washington’s framing of the security situation in the country, home to myriad conflicts that kill across ethnic and religious lines. Nigeria’s kidnappings are predominantly for ransom and the crisis has ‘consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry’ that raised some $1.66 million between July 2024 and June 2025, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based consultancy.

The east African country is struggling to emerge from decades of conflict and chaos, battling a bloody Islamist insurgency and frequent natural disasters. Long lines snaked outside seven polling stations that an AFP correspondent in the capital visited early on Thursday, with those waiting impatient and excited to cast their ballots. ‘This is a great day,’ Guhad Ali, 37, said, proudly showing his ink-stained finger, proof that he had voted. ‘I am so proud that I don’t even feel that I’m queuing,’ said 29-year-old mother of two Shamso Ahmed, who spent hours waiting to cast a ballot for the first time in her life. Thursday’s polls will serve as a test of the direct voting system championed by President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, amid opposition from the country’s states who say it is a bid to centralise power in Mogadishu. ‘This is the future of the Somali people,’ he said after voting, urging every citizen to ‘take the path of democracy’. The volatile nation has stepped up security ahead of the polls, with more than 10,000 security personnel deployed across the capital. ‘This is history today, it is a day the Somali people have gotten a new door opened, so that we call on the more than 500,000 people, who have taken the voting cards to come out and cast their votes,’ electoral commission chief Abdikarim Ahmed Hassan said while visiting a polling station in the south of the capital. Mogadishu police chief Moalim Mahdi told reporters that ‘we are committed to ensuring the safety and security of the people’ and urged ‘patience for each other as you cast your vote’. According to the country’s electoral body more than 1,600 candidates will contest 390 local council seats in the southeastern Banadir region that takes in the capital. Key opposition parties have boycotted the election, accusing the federal government of ‘unilateral election processes’. Somalia’s system of direct voting was abolished after Siad Barre took power in 1969. Since the fall of his authoritarian government in 1991, the country’s political system has revolved around a clan-based structure. Universal suffrage is, however, practised in the breakaway region of Somaliland, which declared independence in 1991 but has never been internationally recognised. In May 2023, the semi-autonomous northern state of Puntland held local elections by direct vote, but later abandoned the system for local and regional polls in January. Thursday’s vote has been postponed three times this year. Somalia has been battling Islamist Al-Shabaab militants since the mid-2000s, but security has deteriorated sharply this year, with the group retaking dozens of towns and villages and reversing most gains from the 2022–2023 military campaign. The electoral body boss Abdikarin Ahmed Hassan on Sunday said all movement would be restricted on election day and ‘the whole country will be shut down’. On Monday, the civil aviation authority announced that the country’s main airport would be closed on voting day. The election is seen as a test ahead of a presidential ballot due in 2026, when President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud’s term comes to an end. While the vote marks a pivotal moment for Somalia, security analyst Samira Gaid expressed scepticism, saying the process was ‘stage-managed’ to make the Horn of Africa nation ‘appear like a democracy’. ‘There is close to zero civilian participation. It’s mostly a government and security forces operation,’ Gaid told AFP, adding that the voter registration exercise had not been successful. The political strain is fuelling tensions ahead of next year’s national elections, with parliament’s mandate expiring in April and the president’s term ending in May. The International Crisis Group has warned that the situation resembles the 2021 political crisis that erupted under former president Mohamed Abdullahi ‘Farmajo’. That led to clashes between clan-based factions after he failed to organise parliamentary and presidential elections before his mandate expired. With the clock ticking, there is still no consensus on how the 2026 election will be conducted, and the opposition and federal member states are threatening to run a parallel process if no agreement is reached.

{"title": "New Age | US launches strikes on IS targets in Nigeria", "body": "President Donald Trump said armed forces conducted ‘powerful and deadly’ strikes Thursday against Islamic State group militants in northwestern Nigeria, weeks after he warned against any systemic assault on Christians in the country. The Nigerian foreign ministry early Friday confirmed the air strikes, describing them as ‘precision hits on terrorist targets’ in the country. The Department of Defense’s US Africa Command said ‘multiple ISIS terrorists’ were killed in an attack in Sokoto state conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, using an acronym for the Islamic State group. Few details were provided and it was not clear how many people were killed. Trump said he had ‘previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was.’ ‘MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues,’ he wrote on his Truth Social platform. US defense officials later posted video of what appeared to be the nighttime launch of a missile from the deck of a battleship flying the US flag. The attack is the first by US forces in Nigeria under Trump, and comes after the Republican leader unexpectedly berated the west African nation in October and November, saying Christians there faced an ‘existential threat’ that amounted to ‘genocide’ amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts. That diplomatic offensive was welcomed by some but interpreted by others as inflaming religious tensions in Africa’s most populous country, which has seen bouts of sectarian violence in the past. Nigeria’s government and independent analysts reject framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution – a narrative long used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe. But Trump, spotlighting what his administration says is global persecution of Christians, stressed last month that Washington was ready to take military action in Nigeria to counter such killings. The Nigerian foreign ministry said the country was engaged with international partners. ‘Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorism and violent extremism,’ the ministry said. Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said he was ‘grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation’ in an X post. The United States this year placed Nigeria back on the list of countries of ‘particular concern’ regarding religious freedom, and has restricted the issuance of visas to Nigerians. Trump last month also threatened to stop all aid to Abuja if it ‘continues to allow the killing of Christians.’ Nigeria is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and a largely Christian south. Its northeast has been in the grip of jihadist violence for more than 15 years by the Islamist Boko Haram group, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives and displaced two million people. At the same time, large parts of the country’s northwest, north and center have been hit by criminal gangs known as ‘bandits’ who attack villages, killing and kidnapping residents. On Wednesday an explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, killing at least seven worshippers. No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility.

{"title": "New Age | Nigeria signals more strikes likely in ‘joint’ US operations", "body": "Nigeria on Friday signalled more strikes against jihadist groups were expected after a Christmas Day bombardment by US forces against militants in the north of the country, which it said was a joint operation with its military. The west African country faces multiple interlinked security crises in its north, where jihadists have been waging an insurgency in the northeast since 2009 and armed ‘bandit’ gangs raid villages and stage kidnappings in the northwest. The US strikes come after Abuja and Washington were locked in a diplomatic dispute over what Trump characterised as the mass killing of Christians amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts. Nigeria’s military said in a statement that its forces, in conjunction with the United States ‘conducted precision strike operations against identified foreign ISIS-linked elements’ in northwest Nigeria. Washington’s framing of the violence as amounting to Christian ‘persecution’ is rejected by the Nigerian government and independent analysts, but has nonetheless resulted in increased security coordination. ‘It’s Nigeria that provided the intelligence,’ the country’s foreign minister, Yusuf Tuggar, told broadcaster Channels TV, saying he was on the phone with US state secretary Marco Rubio ahead of the bombardment. Asked if there would be more strikes, Tuggar said: ‘It is an on-going thing, and we are working with the US. We are working with other countries as well.’ The Department of Defence’s US Africa Command, using an acronym for the Islamic State group, said ‘multiple ISIS terrorists’ were killed in an attack in the northwestern state of Sokoto. US defence officials later posted video of what appeared to be the nighttime launch of a missile from the deck of a battleship flying the US flag. Residents in the far-flung villages of Sokoto state which borders junta-ruled Niger, said they were shocked by the blasts. ‘We heard a loud explosion which shook the whole town and everyone was scared,’ said Haruna Kallah, a Jabo resident, some 100 kilometres from the state capital Sokoto in Tambuwal district. ‘We initially thought it was attack by Lakurawa (an armed group linked to ISIS in the Sahel),’ he said. ‘But later learnt that it was a US drone attack which surprised us because this area has never been a Lakurawa enclave and we have never had any attacks in the last two years.’ Which of Nigeria’s myriad armed groups were targeted remains unclear. Nigeria’s jihadist groups are mostly concentrated in the northeast, but have made inroads into the northwest. Researchers have recently linked some members from an armed group known as Lakurawa — the main jihadist group located in Sokoto State — to Islamic State Sahel Province, which is mostly active in neighbouring Niger and Mali. Other analysts have disputed those links, though research on Lakurawa is complicated as the term has been used to describe various armed fighters in the northwest. Those described as Lakurawa also reportedly have links to al-Qaeda affiliated group for the Support of Islam and Muslims, a rival group to ISSP. While Abuja has welcomed the strikes, ‘I think Trump would not have accepted a ‘No’ from Nigeria,’ said Malik Samuel, an Abuja-based researcher for Good Governance Africa, an NGO. Amid the diplomatic pressure, Nigerian authorities are keen to be seen as cooperating with the US, Samuel said, even though ‘both the perpetrators and the victims in the northwest are overwhelmingly Muslim’. Tuggar said that Nigerian president Bola Tinubu ‘gave the go-ahead’ for the strikes. The foreign minister added: ‘It must be made clear that it is a joint operation, and it is not targeting any religion nor simply in the name of one religion or the other.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/286306/nigeria-signals-more-strikes-likely-in-joint-us-operations", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 627}
{"title": "New Age | Ivory Coast president aims for parliament win", "body": "Ivory Coast is holding legislative elections on Saturday, two months after 83-year-old Alassane Ouattara won a presidential ballot that extended his 14-year rule. Polling stations in the main city, Abidjan, opened an hour late in torrential rain. At Notre Dame college in the Plateau district, voters queued in a hall below a huge portrait of Felix Houphouet-Boigny, the West African nation’s founding president. ‘I don’t feel represented in the national assembly,’ said 21-year-old Assi Gilles Darus Aka. ‘I am here to elect my candidate, so that he can bring forward projects for the professional insertion of students,’ Aka told AFP. Ouattara’s RHDP party has a majority in the 255 seat national assembly. Its candidates in the new poll include prime minister Robert Beugre Mambe and Tene Birahima Ouattara, a brother of the president and defence minister. In October, Ouattara won a fourth term with nearly 90 per cent of votes cast in an election in which most opposition figures were excluded. Eleven people died in violence around the election and dozens of opposition supporters were detained. The PPA-CI party of former president Laurent Gbagbo, who was banned from the presidential vote because of a criminal conviction, boycotted the legislative election. About 20 members of his party are standing however. The PDCI of Tidjane Thiam, another presidential candidate excluded from the October vote, put up candidates for Saturday’s election. One of them, party spokesman Soumaila Bredoumy, was detained in November accused of ‘terrorism’ and ‘plotting against state authority’.

Its spokesman Ali Dheere said in the statement that Israel’s recognition of Somaliland as a sovereign state showed it ‘has decided to expand into parts of the Somali territories’ to support ‘the apostate administration in the northwest regions’. Israel said Friday it was officially recognising Somaliland, a first for the self-proclaimed republic that in 1991 declared it had unilaterally seceded from Somalia. Mogadishu immediately denounced a ‘deliberate attack’ on its sovereignty, while Egypt, Turkey, the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council and the Saudi-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation all condemned Israel’s move. Regional analysts believe that a rapprochement with Somaliland could allow Israel to secure better access to the Red Sea. In addition, press reports a few months ago said Somaliland was among a handful of African territories willing to host Palestinians expelled by Israel, but neither the Somaliland authorities nor the Israeli government has ever commented on those reports. ‘It is humiliation of the highest level today, to see some Somali people celebrating a recognition by the Israeli prime minister Netanyahu’ when ‘Israel is the biggest enemy of the Islamic society’. The territory of Somaliland is roughly a third the size of France and corresponds more or less to the former British Somaliland protectorate. It has its own money, army and police and enjoys relative stability compared to its neighbours. But, until now, Somaliland had not been publicly recognised by any country, which has kept it politically and economically isolated despite its location on one of the world’s busiest trade routes connecting the Indian Ocean to the Suez Canal. Somalia has been battling Al-Shabaab for nearly 20 years and while security has significantly improved in Mogadishu, the war still rages 60 kilometres from the capital.

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Friday announcement, making his country the first to recognise Somaliland, ‘is tantamount to a blunt aggression against the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity, and the unity of the people of the Somali Republic,’ Mohamud said. Somaliland declared independence from Somalia in 1991 and has for decades pushed for international recognition. A self-proclaimed republic, it enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden and has its own money, passports and army. But it has been diplomatically isolated since its unilateral declaration of independence. Somalia’s government and the African Union reacted angrily Friday after Israel’s announcement.

{"title": "New Age | US strikes targeted IS militants, Lakurawa jihadists: Nigeria", "body": "US strikes in Nigeria this week targeted Islamic State militants from the Sahel who were in the country to work with the Lakurawa jihadist group and ‘bandit’ gangs, a spokesman for the Nigerian president said Saturday. The exact targets of the strikes, launched overnight Thursday into Friday, had been unclear. Washington and Abuja previously said they targeted IS-linked militants, without providing details on which of Nigeria’s myriad armed groups were attacked. ‘ISIS, Lakurawa and bandits were targeted,’ Daniel Bwala, a spokesman for president Bola Tinubu, said on Saturday. ‘ISIS found their way through the Sahel to go and assist the Lakurawa and the bandits with supplies and with training,’ he said. The Islamic State Sahel Province group is active in neighbouring Niger, as well as Burkina Faso and Mali, where it is fighting a bloody insurgency against the governments of those countries. While Nigeria has long battled its own, separate jihadist conflict, analysts have been worried about the spread of armed groups from the Sahel into the west African country. ‘The strike was conducted at a location where, historically, you have the bandits and the Lakurawa parading around that axis,’ Bwala said. ‘The intelligence the US government gathered, also, is that there is a mass movement of ISIS from the Sahel to that part.’ There were casualties, but it was unclear who among those targeted were killed, Bwala added. The site of the strikes — in Nigeria’s northwest state of Sokoto — has puzzled analysts, since Nigeria’s jihadist insurgency is mostly concentrated in the northeast. Researchers have recently linked some members of the armed group known as Lakurawa — the main jihadist group located in Sokoto State — to the ISSP. Other analysts have disputed those links, however, and research on Lakurawa is complicated as the term has been used to describe various armed fighters in the northwest. In the northwest, the biggest security concern is that from criminal gangs known as bandits. They loot villages, conduct kidnappings for ransom and extort farmers and artisanal miners across swathes of rural countryside outside of government control. On Friday, information minister Mohammed Idris said the strikes hit ‘two major Islamic State terrorist enclaves’ in Sokoto state’s Tangaza district. Other villages were hit by what the information minister said was debris from the strikes. Images from an AFP photographer in Offa, in neighbouring Kwara state, showed crumbled buildings with roofs caved in and belongings scattered among the wreckage. The strikes — which US president Donald Trump said he pushed back to happen on Christmas Day in order to ‘give a Christmas present’ to the militants — come after a diplomatic spat between Washington and Abuja. Trump accused Nigeria in October and November of allowing ‘persecution’ and ‘genocide’ against Christians. The Nigerian government and independent analysts reject that framing of the country’s violence, which has long been used by the US religious right that backs Trump. The country faces multiple conflicts — from jihadists and bandits to farmer-herder violence and southeastern separatists — that kill both Christians and Muslims. On Christmas Eve, a suspected suicide bomber killed at least five people in an attack on a mosque in northeastern Borno state. After the strikes, Nigerian foreign minister Yusuf Tuggar said: ‘It is a joint operation, and it is not targeting any religion nor simply in the name of one religion or the other.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/286502/us-strikes-targeted-is-militants-lakurawa-jihadists-nigeria", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 589}

Since April 2023, Sudan’s regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have waged what the UN has called a “war of atrocities”, killing tens of thousands of people and uprooting more than 11 million. Between December 25 and 26, attacks on the villages of Um Baru and Kernoi near Sudan’s western border with Chad displaced more than 7,000 people, according to the International Organisation for Migration. After its takeover of the North Darfur capital of El-Fasher in October, the RSF has pushed westward in recent days, through enclaves inhabited by the Zaghawa ethnic group and controlled by an army-allied militia. On Friday, two Chadian soldiers were killed by an RSF drone that hit the border town of Tine, a Chadian military source said. Between Christmas Eve and Friday, a further 3,100 people were displaced from the famine-stricken city of Kadugli in South Kordofan, which has been under siege by paramilitary forces for over a year and a half. Resource-rich Kordofan is currently witnessing the fiercest fighting, as the RSF and its allies seek to recapture Sudan’s central corridor, leading from Darfur back towards the capital Khartoum. The conflict has created the world’s largest hunger and displacement crises. It has also effectively split Sudan in two, with the army controlling the north, east and centre while the RSF dominates all five state capitals in Darfur and, with its allies, parts of the south.

{"title": "New Age | Thousands of Somalis protest against Israeli recognition of Somaliland", "body": "Large protests broke out in several towns and cities across Somalia on Tuesday in opposition to Israel’s recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland. Israel announced on Friday that it viewed Somaliland — which declared independence in 1991 but has never been recognised by any other country — as an ‘independent and sovereign state’. Somali president Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has condemned the move as a threat to stability in the Horn of Africa. He travelled Tuesday to Turkey, a close ally, to discuss the situation. Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Somali capital Mogadishu and gathered at a stadium, waving placards with anti-Israeli slogans alongside Somali and Palestinian flags. ‘We will never allow anyone to violate our sovereignty,’ one attendee, Adan Muhidin, said, adding that Israel’s move was ‘a blatant violation of international law’. Demonstrations also took place in Lascanod in the northeast, Guriceel in central Somalia, and Baidoa in the southwest. ‘There is nothing we have in common with Israel. We say to the people of Somaliland, don’t bring them close to you,’ said Sheikh Ahmed Moalim, a local religious leader, in Guriceel. Somaliland has long been a haven of stability and democracy in the conflict-scarred country, with its own money, passport and army. It also has a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden that makes it an attractive trade and military partner for regional and international allies. But Israel’s decision to recognise its statehood has brought rebukes from across the Muslim and African world, with many fearing it will stoke conflict and division. There have been celebrations in Somaliland’s capital Hargeisa, with the rare sight of Israeli flags being waved in a Muslim-majority nation.

In statements issued separately by both countries’ foreign ministries and seen Wednesday by AFP, they said they were imposing ‘equivalent measures’ on US citizens, after president Donald Trump expanded a travel ban to nearly 40 countries this month, based solely on nationality. That list included Syrian citizens, as well as Palestinian Authority passport holders, and nationals of some of Africa’s poorest countries including also Niger, Sierra Leone and South Sudan. The White House said it was banning foreigners who ‘intend to threaten’ Americans. Burkina Faso’s foreign ministry said in the statement that it was applying ‘equivalent visa measures’ on Americans, while Mali said it was, ‘with immediate effect’, applying ‘the same conditions and requirements on American nationals that the American authorities have imposed on Malian citizens entering the United States’. It voiced its ‘regret’ that the United States had made ‘such an important decision without the slightest prior consultation’. The two sub-Saharan countries, both run by military juntas, are members of a confederation that also includes Niger. Niger has not officially announced any counter-measures to the US travel ban, but the country’s news agency, citing a diplomatic source, said last week that such measures had been decided. In his December 17 announcement, Trump also imposed partial travel restrictions on citizens of other African countries including the most populous, Nigeria, as well as Ivory Coast and Senegal, which qualified for the football World Cup to be played next year in the United States as well as Canada and Mexico.

In a statement, South Sudan People’s Defence Forces spokesperson Lul Ruai Koang said civilians should leave areas near military barracks, assembly points and rally sites. The military order comes a day after an airstrike at a market in Nyirol county killed 26 civilians, according to local media reports. Thirty more people were injured in the attack, a local rights group said. Fighting between the SSPDF and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army in Opposition has escalated since December 24, after SPLA-IO forces overran a military position in Waat, a town in Jonglei State. ‘The orders serve to avoid and minimise collateral damage during phases of military operations,’ reads the statement. The evacuation notice affects three counties; Nyirol, Uror and Akobo, located in Jonglei State. The latest clashes come amid the gradual collapse of a fragile power-sharing deal between president Salva Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar, stoking fears of a renewed slide into civil war. South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 but quickly fell into a five-year civil war. A 2018 peace deal ended fighting but its leaders have repeatedly failed to hold elections or unify their armed forces.

At least 96 were rescued, many of whom were seriously wounded. ‘The Government of The Gambia is aware of a tragic maritime incident involving a boat allegedly transporting over two hundred migrants, reported to have capsized around midnight on December 31 last in the vicinity of Jinack Village in the North Bank Region,’ it said in a statement. Alerted by a distress call, the Gambian Navy launched a search and rescue operation after midnight, involving several naval vessels and a fishing boat that came to assist, according to the statement. The shipwrecked vessel was later found aground on a sandbank. Several of the victims have been identified as not being of Gambian nationality and the authorities are currently verifying their identity, the statement added. Numerous Africans seek to reach Spain’s Canary Islands as a gateway to continental Europe, taking perilous voyages into the Atlantic. The recent strengthening of maritime controls in Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco has led to pirogues headed to the Canaries to depart from even further away, particularly from the coasts of Gambia and Guinea-Conakry, lengthening the time spent at sea and the dangers.

{"title": "New Age | DRC forces-M23 clashes near key city", "body": "Violent fighting broke out Saturday between the Rwandan-backed M23 armed group and pro-Kinshasa forces in several towns around the strategic eastern DR Congo city of Uvira, local sources said. The resource-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which borders Rwanda as well as Burundi, has been beset by 30 years of continual violence. The situation has worsened since 2021 amid the resurgence of the M23. Having seized the two main eastern cities of Goma and Bukavu late last year, the group launched a new offensive in December in South Kivu province and gained control on December 10 of Uvira, a strategic city of several hundred thousand people near Burundi, DRC’s ally. The group also took control of border areas at a time when the DRC and Rwanda were signing a peace accord in Washington brokered by US President Donald Trump. ‘Since 3:00am [0100 GMT], violent clashes between M23 rebels and Wazalendo [pro-Kinshasa militias] and the armed forces of the Republic have been reported in several localities in the territory of Uvira,’ in South Kivu province, Kelvin Bwija, Uvira civil society coordinator, told AFP. Bwija cited the localities of Kashombe, Lubanda, Musingwe, Katongo, and Kigongo, located about 10 kilometers from the city as seeing fighting. ‘So far, the sound of gunfire can be heard in Uvira,’ he said. A resident of Kigongo, also reached by telephone, confirmed to AFP that ‘clashes resumed this morning, with loud explosions and gunfire’ heard. Lieutenant Reagan Mbuyi Kalonji, regional spokesman for the Congolese army, confirmed to AFP ‘clashes in Kigongo and Katongo, specifically in the hills of Kashombe and Lubanda in the territory of Uvira.’ Under US pressure, the M23 announced on December 17 its withdrawal from Uvira, while asking mediators to ensure the city’s protection from violence and ‘remilitarisation.’ There have also been reports of intense fighting in the neighbouring province of North Kivu since Friday, where at least six people were killed and 41 wounded in a bombing attributed to the Congolese army in Masisi territory in North Kivu province, according to local sources. Doctors Without Borders meanwhile stated on social media that ‘42 people, including many children and women, wounded by shrapnel and suffering from other injuries, were admitted to Masisi General Hospital following an air strike in a residential area of Masisi’. MSF added that two had since died.

The seizure was made on January 2 aboard MV Aruna Hulya which ‘originated from Marshall Islands,’ Femi Babafemi, spokesman for the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), said in a statement. Nigeria has long been considered a trafficking and production hub for drugs bound for Europe and other African countries. The agency said in November that it arrested 20 Filipino sailors caught ferrying at least 20 kilogrammes of cocaine from Brazil to the same port. Earlier that month, NDLEA said it was working with US and British anti-drug agencies to investigate a cartel behind the importation of 1,000 kilograms of cocaine discovered in a container at a Lagos port.

{"title": "New Age | 30 killed, several kidnapped in central Nigeria", "body": "Armed gangs have raided a village a north-central Nigerian state, where hundreds of schoolchildren were abducted late last year, killing more than 30 people and kidnapping several others, police said Sunday. Know locally as ‘bandits’, the gangs invaded Kasuwan Daji village in Kabe district of Niger State and set a market ablaze, before looting shops for food. ‘Over 30 victims lost their lives during the attack, some persons were also kidnapped,’ during the raid on Saturday, Wasiu Abiodun, Niger police spokesman said. Several pictures and video footage seen by AFP showed that some of the victims had their hands tied to their backs before they were killed. Gangs regularly carry out mass kidnappings for ransom and loot villages in the parts of northwest and northcentral Nigeria. Niger state has been one of the hardest hit in recent months. In November, armed gangs seized more than 250 students and staff from a Catholic school in the state. Authorities announced their release in two batches weeks later without saying whether ransom was paid. The attack took place less than 20 kilometres from Papiri village where the students and teachers were snatched from their school. The Catholic church in the area put the death toll at more than 40, a much higher toll than that given by police. ‘Reports indicate the bandits operated for hours with no security presence,’ the Catholic Church in Kontagora said on its Facebook page. Nigeria’s security system is stretched thin by security challenges in different parts of the country. Africa’s most populous country faces multiple conflicts — linked to a long-running jihadist insurgency, bandits, farmer-herder violence or southeastern separatists — that kill both Christians and Muslims. On Christmas Eve, a suspected suicide bomber killed at least five people in an attack on a mosque in northeastern Borno state. Washington has in recent months criticised the country’s failure to rein in the violence that president Donald Trump insists amounts to ‘persecution’ of Christians — a framing long used by the US religious right. Despite the Nigerian government and independent analysts rejecting the accusations, the US launched surprise Christmas day airstrikes on militants linked to the Islamic State group. Abuja said it approved the hits. President Bola Tinubu in December vowed a national security revamp when he presented the government’s 2026 budget to the national assembly, allocating the biggest chunk of spending to defence, days after he appointed a new defence minister.

{"title": "New Age | 114 killed in week of attacks in Sudan’s Darfur", "body": "Attacks by Sudan’s army and its paramilitary foes on two towns in the western Darfur region over the past week have killed 114 people, medical sources said Sunday. Since April 2023, Sudan has been gripped by a war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which in October seized the army’s last holdout position in Darfur. The RSF has since pushed west to the Chadian border and east through the vast Kordofan region, where a drone strike on the North Kordofan capital of El-Obeid on Sunday caused a blackout in the key army-controlled city. A medical source reported Sunday that 51 people were killed the day before in drone strikes attributed to the army on the North Darfur town of Al-Zuruq, 180 kilometres north of the RSF-overrun state capital El-Fashir. The strike hit a market and civilian areas, the source said. Al-Zuruq, under RSF control, is home to family members of RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, the former deputy of his now rival, army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. ‘Two of the Daglo family were killed, Moussa Saleh Daglo and Awad Moussa Saleh Daglo,’ an eyewitness to the burial said. Both the RSF and the army are accused of targeting civilian areas, in what the UN has called a ‘war of atrocities’. RSF fighters advancing westward towards the border with Chad last week killed another 63 people in and around the town of Kernoi, a medical source in the local hospital said Sunday. ‘Until Friday, 63 were killed and 57 injured in attacks launched by the RSF around Kernoi,’ they said, speaking on condition of anonymity for their safety. Local sources said that 17 people were still missing. The entire Darfur region is largely inaccessible to reporters and is under a years-long communications blackout, forcing local volunteers and medics to use satellite internet to get news to the world. According to the United Nations, over 7,000 people were displaced in just two days last month from Kernoi and the nearby village of Um Baru. Many are from the Zaghawa group, which has been targeted by the RSF. Members of the group have fought in the current war alongside the army in a coalition known as the Joint Forces. Since the war began, tens of thousands have been killed and millions displaced. Much of the worst fighting has been in Darfur, reviving memories of mass ethnic atrocities committed in the 2000s by the Janjaweed, the RSF’s predecessor. The war’s fiercest violence is currently unfolding in Kordofan, Sudan’s vast oil-rich southern region that links Darfur to the capital Khartoum, which the army recaptured last year. Drone strikes on North Kordofan capital El-Obeid caused a power outage, the national electricity company said. ‘El-Obeid power station was attacked by drones, leading to a fire in the machinery building, which led to a halt in the electricity supply,’ the company said. Following its victory in El-Fasher, the RSF has sought to recapture Sudan’s central corridor, tightening its siege with its local allies around several army-held cities. Hundreds of thousands face mass starvation across the region. Last year, the army broke a paramilitary siege on El-Obeid, which the RSF has sought to encircle since. The Joint Forces said last week they had retaken several towns south of El-Obeid, which according to a military source could ‘open up the road between El-Obeid and Dilling’ — bone of South Kordofan’s besieged cities. Since mid-December, some 11,000 people have been displaced from North and South Kordofan states, according to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration. The war has forced more than 11 million people to flee internally and across Sudan’s borders, many of them seeking shelter in underdeveloped areas with a lack of nutrition, medicine and clean water.

Thousands of people, most of them young, have tried to reach Europe from west Africa, mainly via the Spanish Canary Islands, on overcrowded and often dilapidated boats due to restrictions on visas and tighter border security. Migrant boats have been forced to leave from further south, notably from The Gambia and Guinea, adding to the journey — and dangers — at sea, after Senegal, Mauritania and Morocco increased maritime patrols. In the latest such tragedy, a boat loaded with more than 200 people made a distress call overnight December 31 to January 1 near the North Bank region. The Gambian Navy launched a hunt for survivors after midnight, involving several vessels and a fishing boat. The stricken vessel was later found on a sandbank. ‘Fifteen bodies are confirmed to be recovered from the Gambia and 16 in Senegal,’ said the government in its update, hiking the previous toll of at least 7 dead. 102 people were rescued, 23 of whom were hospitalised. President Adama Barrow said on Friday that the country was in mourning over the disaster.

{"title": "New Age | S Africa calls joint naval drills with Iran, Russia ‘essential’", "body": "South Africa on Saturday began naval drills with Russia, Iran and China, describing the manoeuvres off its coast as not merely a show of force but a vital response to rising maritime tensions. The week‑long ‘Will for Peace 2026’ exercises come just days after the United States seized a Russian‑flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic, saying it carried crude bound for Venezuela, Russia and Iran in violation of Western sanctions. The seizure followed an American raid that toppled Moscow’s ally Nicolas Maduro in Caracas. The drills—led by China—were more than a military exercise and a statement of intent among the BRICS group of emerging nations, Captain Nndwakhulu Thomas Thamaha, South Africa’s joint taskforce commander, told the opening Ceremony. ‘It is a demonstration of our collective resolve to work together,’ he said. BRICS, originally made up of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, has expanded to include Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and, more recently, Indonesia. China and Iran deployed destroyer warships, while Russia and the United Arab Emirates sent corvette vessels. Host South Africa dispatched a frigate. Indonesia, Ethiopia and Brazil joined as observers. ‘In an increasingly complex maritime environment, cooperation such as this is not an option, it is essential,’ said Thamaha. The exercises were to ‘ensure the safety of shipping lanes and maritime economic activities,’ he said. Previously known as Exercise Mosi, the drills were initially scheduled for last November but postponed due to a clash with the G20 summit in Johannesburg, boycotted by the United States. Washington has accused South Africa and the BRICS bloc of ‘anti‑American’ policies and warned members they could face an additional 10 per cent tariff on top of existing duties already applied worldwide. South Africa has also drawn US criticism for its close ties with Russia and a range of other policies, including its decision to bring a genocide case against Washington ally Israel at the International Court of Justice over the Gaza war. South Africa drew criticism for hosting naval drills with Russia and China in 2023, coinciding with the first anniversary of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The three nations first conducted joint naval drills in 2019.

{"title": "New Age | Guinea-Bissau bans unofficial press events, statements", "body": "Guinea-Bissau’s junta on Friday announced it was banning all unauthorised press conferences and public statements, some six weeks after coming to power in a post-election coup. After ousting leader Umaro Sissoco Embalo on November 26, just after the presidential vote, the army suspended the electoral process and announced it was taking control of the coup-prone West African country for one year. On Friday, the high military command, the junta’s governing body, said in a statement that ‘some individuals and ethnic groups, particularly political figures, have promoted secret meetings and used those to incite violence and disobedience’, including to the country’s transitional charter. The charter was published in early December and is intended to provide a legal framework for the country’s period under military rule. The High Military Command said that it ‘expressly prohibited the holding of any press conferences or public statements that are not authorised and that jeopardise peace and social cohesion’. ‘Any person or entity that challenges the public order decreed by the transitional authorities will be severely reprimanded, in compliance with the law,’ the statement said. After toppling Embalo, the junta originally alleged drug barons were conspiring to sow chaos in the country, a cocaine-trafficking hotspot. But in early December, authorities said instead that the unstable country faced a ‘grave’ political situation in the wake of the ballot ‘which could degenerate into a civil war with ethnic undertones’. Observers and the opposition have raised the possibility that Embalo engineered the takeover to halt the electoral process as he was losing at the ballot box. Before November’s coup, Guinea-Bissau had already undergone four military takeovers and a litany of attempted insurrections since gaining independence from Portugal in 1974.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan PM announces govt return to Khartoum from wartime capital", "body": "Sudan’s prime minister Kamil Idris announced on Sunday the government’s return to Khartoum, after nearly three years of operating from its wartime capital of Port Sudan. In the early days of the regular military’s war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in April 2023, the army-aligned government fled the capital, which was quickly overrun by rival troops. It has pursued a gradual return to Khartoum since the army recaptured the city last March. ‘Today, we return, and the Government of Hope returns to the national capital,’ Idris told reporters in Khartoum, promising ‘better services’ for residents. For close to two years, the Sudanese capital — composed of the three cities of Khartoum, Omdurman and Khartoum North (Bahri) — was an active battlefield. Entire neighbourhoods were besieged, rival fighters shot artillery across the Nile River and millions of people were displaced from the city. Between March and October, 1.2 million people returned to Khartoum, according to the United Nations. Many found a city with barely functioning services, their homes destroyed and neighbourhoods pockmarked by makeshift cemeteries authorities are now exhuming. The war is estimated to have killed tens of thousands of people in the capital alone, but the complete toll is unknown, as many families are forced to bury their dead in makeshift graves. Idris said the government was committed to improving electricity, water, healthcare and education services. According to the UN, the rehabilitation of the capital’s essential infrastructure would cost some $350 million. In recent months, the government has held some cabinet meetings in Khartoum and launched reconstruction efforts. The city has witnessed relative calm, though the RSF has carried out drone strikes, particularly on infrastructure. Battles rage elsewhere across the vast country. South of Khartoum, the RSF has pushed through the Kordofan region, after dislodging the army from its last stronghold in Darfur last year. The conflict has left 11 million people displaced internally and across borders, and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises.

{"title": "New Age | Ugandan opposition turns national flag into protest symbol", "body": "Hundreds screamed with excitement as Uganda’s opposition leader passed by a recent rally, with the crowd waving a sea of national flags — a dangerously politicised symbol in the run-up to this week’s election. Analysts say it is almost a foregone conclusion that president Yoweri Museveni, 81, will win a seventh term in Thursday’s vote, given his near-total control over the state apparatus in the east African country. But his opponent, 43-year-old Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobi Wine, has framed the election as a protest vote and cannily turned the national flag into a symbol of resistance. Police last month warned against using the flag ‘casually and inappropriately’. Wine’s supporters have faced frequent intimidation by the security forces during the campaign, according to the United Nations Human Rights Office and other observers. But the flag is ‘the only weapon we have,’ said woodworker Conrad Olwenyi, 31, at a Wine rally this week. ‘We cannot fight the security, because they have a gun. We only have the flag,’ he said. But ‘if they shoot you when you have the flag, they are shooting the country.’ Uganda’s flag — created when the country achieved independence from Britain in 1962 — has stripes of black to represent Africa, yellow for its sunshine, and red to represent African brotherhood, with a grey crowned crane overlaid. In the 2021 elections, Wine’s National Unity Platform adopted red berets as a symbol, but the government ruled that was illegal since they were part of the military uniform, and used that ruling to justify raids on the party’s offices. The flag is a clever alternative and a way of ‘reclaiming patriotism,’ said Uganda expert Kristof Titeca. ‘It’s kind of taken the government by surprise, and so that’s why they started this clampdown,’ he said. Like many countries in east Africa, there are laws governing how the national flag may be used, though these were rarely enforced in Uganda in the past. ‘It shows the panic,’ prominent cartoonist Jimmy Spire Ssentongo said. ‘I don’t think they are threatened by misuse of the flag. They are threatened by the visibility of the support towards NUP,’ said Ssentongo, adding that as Museveni ages and nears 40 years in power, ‘the space for freedom of expression also shrinks’. ‘Everyone has a right to use the national flag, but it depends on in what context they’re using it for. I believe the opposition is politicising it,’ said Israel Kyarisiima, a national youth co-ordinator for Museveni’s National Resistance Movement party. Security services have repeatedly been accused by Wine’s supporters of targeting those carrying the flag at rallies, with the leader urging followers in his Christmas address to ‘come to the defence of anyone assaulted for carrying the flag’. And the threats from police have not stopped Wine’s supporters brandishing the flag at rallies. ‘Now we’ve got something that can really show our unity as Ugandans, and they are trying to make it criminal,’ said one attendee this week, Ruth Excellent Mirembe, 25, waving a flag. Trying to stop its use is ‘oppression in the highest form,’ she said. ’This represents us as Ugandans.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/africa/287842/ugandan-opposition-turns-national-flag-into-protest-symbol", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 550}

Since April 2023, the civil war between the army and the RSF has killed tens of thousands and left around 11 million people displaced internally and across borders. Sennar state has seen relative calm since the army recaptured key Sudanese cities in late 2024 in an offensive that later saw it regain the capital Khartoum. The Sennar region was last targeted by drones in October. One resident of Sinja said on Monday that they ‘heard explosions and anti-aircraft fire’.

{"title": "New Age | Uganda shuts down internet ahead of election", "body": "Ugandan authorities ordered an internet blackout on Tuesday, two days ahead of elections in which president Yoweri Museveni is seeking to extend his 40-year rule. The 81-year-old leader, who once said African rulers should not overstay their time in office, is widely expected to win a seventh term on Thursday due to his total control over state and security bodies. But he is taking no chances against a popular opponent, Bobi Wine, a 43-year-old singer-turned-politician, who has drawn large crowds to his rallies despite violent repression from the security forces. Museveni held his final campaign rally in the capital Kampala on Tuesday, in a grand show most international media were blocked from covering. Thousands walked to Kololo National Ceremonial Gardens for the rally, many telling AFP they had been bussed into the capital for the event and given free food. Foreign journalists were repeatedly denied access to the grounds despite having accreditation from the government, some threatened with arrest. ‘Your camera is not welcome,’ an unidentified Special Forces Command officer told the reporters. Rights groups and international monitors say hundreds of opposition supporters have been arrested in the run-up to the election. Another key opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, who has run four times against Museveni, was kidnapped in Kenya in 2024 and brought back to a military court in Uganda, where he is still on trial. In a letter to internet providers, the Uganda Communications Commission said the internet shutdown, due to come into effect at 1500 GMT on Tuesday, was necessary to prevent ‘misinformation’ and ‘incitement to violence’, and would last until further notice. The letter’s veracity was confirmed by two government officials to AFP. There was no official statement from the government, with the officials saying no one wanted to ‘own’ the decision. Uganda shut down the internet during the last election in 2021 — a vote that was marred by widespread allegations of rigging and state violence. The government repeatedly promised the internet would not be cut this time, stating in a post on X on January 5 that ‘claims suggesting otherwise are false, misleading, and intended to cause unnecessary fear and tension among the public’. Neighbouring Tanzania also shut down the internet during its election in October, which triggered massive unrest over rigging allegations. Security forces responded by killing hundreds of protesters, according to the opposition. Despite the heavy security presence on Tuesday, thousands attended the colourful rally in Kampala featuring a life-size mascot of Museveni that waved mechanically at the cheering crowds. Banura Oliver, 41, said she would vote for the president because of the peace he had brought to the country in the 1980s. ‘Forty years doesn’t even matter, we need even more,’ she said, adding she was dismissive of the opposition candidate. ‘If Ugandan people vote badly and vote for this young boy, we are going to suffer. He is not a good leader,’ she said. Others said they were only there for the free rice and meat and did not intend to vote for Museveni. ‘You give me food for today, but what is tomorrow?’ Mugaala, 23 and unemployed, who did not want to give his second name, said.

{"title": "New Age | Sudan food aid to run out in March without new funding: UN", "body": "Food aid in Sudan is set to run out by the end of March unless new funding is secured, the United Nations said Thursday, raising fears for millions caught up in the world’s largest hunger crisis. The warning comes after almost three years of civil war in Sudan, where fighting between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has left tens of thousands dead and 11 million displaced. “By the end of March, we will have depleted our food stocks in Sudan,” Ross Smith, the World Food Programme’s Director of Emergency Preparedness and Response, said in a statement. “Without immediate additional funding, millions of people will be left without vital food assistance within weeks,” he added. Smith said the WFP has already “been forced to reduce rations to the absolute minimum for survival”. According to the UN, more than 21 million people—almost half of Sudan’s population—are now facing acute food insecurity. A UN-backed assessment confirmed last year that famine had taken hold in El-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, which was overrun by the paramilitary forces in October. Famine has also been confirmed in Kadugli, in neighbouring Kordofan, now a key battleground in the conflict. In Dilling, around 130 kilometres (80 miles) to the north, the UN says civilians are likely experiencing famine conditions, though security issues and a lack of access have prevented a formal declaration.

{"title": "New Age | Ten killed in Ugandan elections Museveni set to extend 40-year rule", "body": "At least 10 people died in violence-marred elections in Uganda, the opposition said Friday, as veteran leader Yoweri Museveni looked set to prolong his four-decade rule in a ballot that saw widespread repression and an internet blackout. Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine said he was under house arrest after Thursday’s vote while Uganda’s Electoral Commission said Museveni was on 75.4 per cent to Wine’s 20.7 with close to 60 per cent of votes counted. Final results are due by 0200 GMT on Saturday. Authorities imposed an internet blackout during the election that was still in place on Friday. Wine, 43, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the main challenger to Museveni in recent years. The former singer styles himself the ‘ghetto president’ after the slum areas of Kampala where he grew up. ‘After casting my ballot, the military deployed all around my home in order to place me under house arrest,’ Wine wrote on X. ‘They do this because they are afraid of the people’s reaction after stealing their vote.’ AFP journalists visited the compound early Friday and said it was outwardly calm, though a military vehicle and several police officers were stationed outside. Local station NBS quoted a police spokesman saying Wine was ‘not under house arrest, we’re just providing him with security.’ Muwanga Kivumbi, member of parliament for Wine’s party in the Butambala area of central Uganda, told AFP’s Nairobi office by phone that security forces had killed 10 of his campaign agents after storming his home. His wife Zahara Nampewo, a law professor, said the 10 were hiding in their garage when security forces fired through the door. ‘After killing them, the military continued firing,’ Kivumbi said. ‘And they ensured that they removed all the evidence of the dead. You only have a pool of blood that is left here.’ Local police spokeswoman Lydia Tumushabe gave a different account, saying ‘a group of NUP goons’ had planned to overrun and burn down a local tally centre and police station. ‘An unspecified number were put out of action,’ she said, adding that 25 others had been arrested and charged with malicious damage of property. Analysts have long viewed the election as a formality. Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus, and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule. Election day was marred by significant technical problems after biometric machines — used to confirm voters’ identities — malfunctioned and ballot papers were undelivered for several hours in many areas. There was a heavy security presence across the country. The United Nations rights office said last week that the elections were taking place in an environment marked by ‘widespread repression and intimidation’ against the opposition. On Thursday, Wine accused the government of ‘massive ballot stuffing’ and attacking several of his party officials under cover of the internet blackout, which was imposed on Tuesday. His claims could not be verified by AFP.

{"title": "New Age | Uganda’s Museveni wins 7th term amid intimidation claims", "body": "Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni won a seventh term in office on Saturday after an election marred by violence and an internet shutdown, with African observers saying arrests and abductions had ‘instilled fear’. Museveni, 81, won 71.65 per cent of the vote in Thursday’s election, the Electoral Commission said, amid reports of at least 10 deaths and intimidation of the opposition and civil society. His victory allows him to extend his 40-year rule of the east African country. He defeated Bobi Wine, 43, a former singer-turned-politician who won 24.72 per cent and said he was in hiding on Saturday after a raid by security forces on his home. Wine has faced relentless pressure since entering politics, including multiple arrests before his first run for the presidency in 2021. He stated his ‘complete rejection of the fake results’ and said he was on the run after the raid on his home on Friday night. ‘I want to confirm that I managed to escape from them,’ Wine posted on X on Saturday. Currently, I am not at home, although my wife and other family members remain under house arrest. ‘I know that these criminals are looking for me everywhere and I am trying my best to keep safe,’ he added. There was a heavy police presence around the capital, Kampala, AFP journalists saw, as security forces sought to prevent the sort of protests that have hit neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania in recent months. Police denied they had raided Wine’s home but said they had ‘controlled access in areas we feel are security hotspots’, adding they believed the opposition leader was still at home. ‘We have not necessarily denied people accessing him but we cannot tolerate instances where people use his residence to gather and... incite violence,’ police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke told reporters. A stall-owner near Wine’s home, 29-year-old Prince Jerard, told AFP he had heard a drone and helicopter at the residence the previous night, and saw numerous security officials. ‘Many people have left [the area],’ he said. ‘We have a lot of fear.’ Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the main challenger to Museveni in recent years, styling himself the ‘ghetto president’ after the Kampala slum areas where he grew up. He has accused the government of ‘massive ballot stuffing’ and attacking several of his party officials under cover of the internet blackout, which was imposed ahead of the polls and remained in place on Saturday. African election observers said on Saturday they saw no evidence of ballot stuffing but denounced ‘reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions’ targeting the opposition and civil society. This ‘instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process’, former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan told reporters in Kampala. He was representing election observers from the African Union, as well as regional bodies COMESA and IGAD for east and southern Africa. Jonathan said the shutdown of the internet ‘disrupted effective observation’ and ‘increased suspicion’ but that the overall conduct of the polls on election day was ‘peaceful’. Museveni’s ruling party, the National Resistance Movement, also had a commanding lead in parliamentary seats, according to provisional results. Ballots were still being counted. Analysts have long viewed the election as a formality. Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus, and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule. The other major opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, who ran four times against Museveni, was abducted in Kenya in 2024 and brought back to a military court in Uganda for a treason trial that is ongoing. There were reports of election-related violence against the opposition. Muwanga Kivumbi, member of parliament for Wine’s party in the Butambala area of central Uganda, told AFP’s Nairobi office by phone that security forces had killed 10 of his campaign agents after storming his home. Police gave a different account, saying an ‘unspecified number’ of people had been ‘put out of action’ when opposition members planned to overrun and burn down a local tally centre and police station.

{"title": "New Age | Sudanese put through ‘hell’ as advanced weapons fuel war: UN", "body": "Nearly three years of war have put the Sudanese people through ‘hell’, the UN’s rights chief said Sunday, blasting the vast sums spent on advanced weaponry at the expense of humanitarian aid and the recruitment of child soldiers. Since April 2023, Sudan has been gripped by a conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces that has left tens of thousands of people dead and around 11 million displaced. Speaking in Port Sudan during his first wartime visit, UN Human Rights commissioner Volker Turk said the population had endured ‘horror and hell’, calling it ‘despicable’ that funds that ‘should be used to alleviate the suffering of the population’ are instead spent on advanced weapons, particularly drones. More than 21 million people are facing acute food insecurity, and two-thirds of Sudan’s population is in urgent need of humanitarian aid, according to the UN. In addition to the world’s largest hunger and displacement crisis, Sudan is also facing ‘the increasing militarisation of society by all parties to the conflict, including through the arming of civilians and recruitment and use of children’, Turk added. He said he had heard testimony of ‘unbearable’ atrocities from survivors of attacks in Darfur, and warned of similar crimes unfolding in the Kordofan region — the current epicentre of the fighting. Testimony of these atrocities must be heard by ‘the commanders of this conflict and those who are arming, funding and profiting from this war’, he said. The UN has repeatedly warned of rampant interference from foreign actors. The United Arab Emirates has been widely accused of supplying the RSF with weapons, mercenaries and political backing, which Abu Dhabi consistently denies. The army’s biggest backers are Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and it has reportedly also received arms including drones from Iran and Turkey. Mediation efforts have failed to produce a ceasefire, even after international outrage intensified last year with reports of mass killings, rape and abductions during the RSF’s takeover of El-Fasher in Darfur. ‘We must ensure that the perpetrators of these horrific violations face justice regardless of the affiliation,’ Turk said on Sunday, adding that repeated attacks on civilian infrastructure could constitute ‘war crimes’. He called on both sides to ‘cease intolerable attacks against civilian objects that are indispensable to the civilian population, including markets, health facilities, schools and shelters’. Turk again warned on Sunday that crimes similar to those seen in El-Fasher could recur in volatile Kordofan, where the RSF has advanced, besieging and attacking several key cities. Hundreds of thousands face starvation across the region, where more than 65,000 people have been displaced since October, according to the latest UN figures.

{"title": "New Age | Uganda maintains social media ban after election", "body": "Uganda said Sunday it would maintain a ban on social media platforms, while lifting a nationwide internet block hours after long-time ruler Yoweri Museveni was declared the winner of national elections. The internet was blocked two days before polls opened on Thursday. While the government said that was necessary to curb ‘misinformation’, the United Nations labelled the decision ‘deeply worrying’. Although much of the country remained calm after the vote, there were reports of small-scale protests late Saturday after the results, with AFP journalists hearing tear gas in parts of capital Kampala. As of Sunday morning, the security presence in Kampala appeared to have significantly decreased with people out on the streets and shops open. ‘Social media platforms remain temporarily restricted to continue safeguarding against misuse that could threaten public order,’ said George Nyombi Thembo, executive director of Uganda Communications Commission. He confirmed the return of most of the internet, while justifying the days-long suspension as ‘necessary and proportionate’. The cut was to ‘prevent the rapid spread of misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation, to curb potential electoral fraud and protect against incitement to violence during a highly sensitive national period’, he said. Thembo declined to say when full access would be restored, telling reporters: ‘I don’t want to put estimate.’ ‘We are a reasonable agency. We are a reasonable government. We don’t expect this to exceed a reasonable time that will mitigate the risk that we are seeing,’ he said. It comes after an election characterised by low turnout and major security deployments, as the government sought to prevent protests similar to those seen in neighbouring Tanzania during polls in October last year. Analysts have long viewed Ugandan election as a formality, with Museveni exerting total control over the state and security apparatus.

{"title": "New Age | PRICE FALL, LACK OF STORAGE FACILITIES: Potato growers in north stare at heavy losses", "body": "Potato growers in the northern districts are staring at heavy losses this season due to a plunge in the price of potatoes, with the harvesting of the cash crop going on in full swing. The small- and medium-scale farmers are also facing a lack of adequate cold storage facilities. Potatoes are selling at Tk 12-15 a kilogram on the local wholesale markets and at Tk 15-18 a kilogram on the local retail markets. But potatoes are selling at up to Tk 25 a kilogram on the retail markets in the capital Dhaka. Farmers said that they would not be able to cover their production costs this season as the potato price continued to decrease despite the production costs going higher than the previous year. ‘It cost me Tk 20 to produce one kilogram of potatoes this year. But I have to sell the crop for Tk 15 a kilogram,’ said Md Faisal, a potato grower at Tanore in Rajshahi. He said that the potato yield in their area had almost halved due to relatively high temperatures in the past winter season. ‘I got about 65 maunds of potatoes from one bigha of land this year, although the yield from the same area of land in the past season was 130 maunds,’ he added. Another grower, Mizanur Rahman, said that he was facing a loss of Tk 10 a kilogram as the potato price dropped to Tk 12 on the local wholesale markets on Saturday. He said that encouraged by the past year’s profits, he along with many other farmers invested heavily in potato cultivation this season. ‘Some of us used our savings while others took loans from banks and non-government organisations to expand potato farming. However, the potato price fall has left us shattered,’ he lamented. Mizanur said that the small- and medium-scale growers were not getting cold storage facilities. ‘Potato prices have gradually been dropping each day by a margin of Tk 1 or Tk 2 a kilogram,’ said Gias Uddin, a potato trader at Kharkhari Bazar at Paba in Rajshahi. He said that the potato prices had dropped to Tk 12 a kilogram on Saturday, although it was sold at Tk 18 a kilogram a week ago. Farmers and traders attributed the fall in potato prices to a lack of enough cold storages coupled with excess cultivation. ‘Due to a lack of adequate cold storage facilities, farmers are unable to store potatoes and are being forced to sell them on the market. As a result, the supply has exceeded the demand. So, the price of potatoes continues to drop,’ Gias added. According to the Department of Agriculture Extension, potatoes were cultivated on 3.95 lakh hectares of land this year in the sixteen districts of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions where the country’s 75 per cent potatoes are grown. In the 2023-24 session, potatoes were cultivated on 3.38 lakh hectares of land in the two divisions while 79 lakh tonnes of the crop were produced. Agricultural officers said that farmers had cultivated potatoes on approximately 50,000 hectares more than the estimated area this season as the potato prices were favourable in the past season. They estimated that about 103 lakh tonnes of potatoes would be produced in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions this season alone while a total of 106 lakh tonnes of potatoes were produced in Bangladesh in the past 2023-24 financial year. Although the potato acreage and production have increased significantly, the number of cold storages remains the same, leaving potato growers to struggle for managing a space to store their crops, they said. According to DAE officials, there are 220 cold storages in Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions where about 22 lakh tonnes of agricultural produce can be stored. ‘Potatoes have been cultivated on more land compared with the previous year. We are a little bit worried because farmers will not be able to store their crops as we have a limited number of cold storages. As the farmers cannot store their potatoes and are forced to sell those, the potato prices may drop a little bit more,’ said Azizur Rahman, additional director of the Rajshahi divisional DAE office.

{"title": "New Age | Agrochemical producers demand policy support", "body": "Bangladeshi agrochemical producers have called on the government to introduce urgent policy support aimed at achieving self-sufficiency in local production. Their key demands include liberalising raw material sourcing, scrapping import duties on supplementary chemicals, and declaring the agrochemical sector a priority industry to qualify for low-interest loans and export incentives. The demands were raised on Saturday at a workshop titled ‘Barriers and Challenges Faced by Domestic Agrochemical Producers in Reducing Agricultural Production Costs’ held at the BRAC Inn Centre in Dhaka. Bangladesh Agro-Chemical Manufacturers Association President KSM Mostafizur Rahman criticised the single country, single source policy enforced by the Pesticide Technical Advisory Committee for importing pesticide raw materials. He alleged that this policy, influenced by multinational companies, blocked domestic firms from sourcing more affordable inputs available from other countries, while multinationals profit by importing materials from their own overseas facilities at inflated prices. Mostafiz said that the regulatory framework had been modified to include a country of origin clause, which has no legal justification. He also called for the withdrawal of import duties on chemicals and policy recognition of the sector as a priority industry, arguing that these measures could enable local firms to meet domestic demand and begin exporting to Asia, Africa, and Central America within three years. In his keynote presentation, Gazipur Agricultural University Professor Abdul Karim of outlined several hurdles facing domestic agrochemical producers, including the restrictive single-source policy, lack of a national policy for raw material production, unlawful monopolies on patented products and delays in clearing raw materials at ports. He recommended eliminating the single-source requirement, implementing patent and compulsory licensing laws, reforming the Pesticide Technical Advisory Committee and cancelling the need for No Objection Certificates for raw material imports. Bangladesh Association of Pharmaceutical Industries secretary general Zakir Hossain expressed strong support for the call to achieve self-sufficiency in agrochemicals, pledging the cooperation of the pharmaceutical sector. According to industry representatives, the country’s agrochemical market is currently valued at around Tk 7,500 crore. However, seven multinational companies control more than 90 percent of the market, while 17 domestic companies account for only about 6 per cent.

{"title": "New Age | Dolomite boosts crop yields for Rajshahi farmers: experts", "body": "Dolomite has emerged as a game-changer for many farmers in the Rajshahi region, especially in the Barind tract, significantly increasing crop yields and improving soil health over the past few years. Dolomite, a naturally occurring mineral composed of calcium magnesium carbonate, is widely used as a soil amendment to neutralise acidity — a common issue in Barind’s soils. By improving soil pH, dolomite enhances nutrient availability, particularly phosphorus, and supports beneficial microbial activity, all of which are vital for healthy plant growth. Experts said that correcting soil acidity and promoting nutrient balance through dolomite application had led to marked improvements in agricultural productivity. As a result, farmers are seeing higher yields and greater financial returns. Helal Uddin, 48, a farmer from Soronjai village in Tanore upazila, harvested 97 mounds of potatoes per bigha on his traditional plot. But from an adjacent experimental plot treated with dolomite and other inputs, he harvested 116 mounds — a 20 per cent increase. During a recent farmers’ field day held at Soronji playground, similar success stories were shared. Mainul Islam, 43, from the same village, reported harvesting 115 mounds of potatoes per bigha in an experimental plot compared to just 90 mounds from his regular practice. His chickpea yield doubled — 13 mounds on the experimental plot versus six on his own field. Ariful Islam of Pachandar village said that he reaped nine mounds of lentils from the test plot, compared to six mounds from his traditional system. He described the combined dolomite and organic matter approach as cost-effective and sustainable. In Gomastapur upazila, Abdul Moin, 56, saw similar benefits. He cultivated wheat on two bighas — one traditional and one experimental. The plot treated with dolomite yielded 18 mounds, while the untreated one produced only 12. These results were part of a series of field trials conducted in Rajshahi, Chapainawabganj, and Naogaon districts. The trials compared traditional farming practices with enhanced methods that used dolomite, organic fertilizers, and bio-pesticides. According to the Soil Resource Development Institute (SRDI), dolomite helps create a soil environment that improves the effectiveness of chemical fertilizers while reducing environmental harm from fertilizer runoff. This leads to better nutrient uptake, healthier crops, and increased yields. The SRDI’s Rajshahi regional office has set up 164 demonstration plots under its project titled ‘Acidic Soil Management and Sustainable Crop Production through Climate-Smart Agriculture in Rajshahi and Rangpur Divisions, including the Madhupur Tract.’ The project also trained 970 sub-assistant agriculture officers and progressive farmers on soil management techniques. SRDI provides location-specific guidance on soil amendments and fertiliser use through its Upazila Nirdeshika, helping farmers apply dolomite and other treatments effectively and sustainably. Nurul Islam, principal scientific officer at SRDI, said that farmers participating in the project received comprehensive support including fertilisers, irrigation, labour and technical guidance to manage one bigha of experimental crop land. ‘Dolomite is a key tool for improving soil health in Rajshahi’s High Barind Tract,’ Nurul said, adding, ‘Our goal is to increase average crop yields by addressing soil acidity and promoting Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), ensuring long-term agricultural resilience and productivity.’ He emphasised that improving soil quality and fertility through sustainable practices not only boosted yields but also ensured that resources were preserved for future generations.

{"title": "New Age | Red Lady Papaya brings success to young farmer", "body": "The ‘Red Lady Papaya’ cultivated in Hogla village of Kanakdia Union, Bauphal, has become widely popular across the Upazila and the district of Patuakhali. Young entrepreneur Md Nazmul, 30, who decided to leave his corporate job in Dhaka, aims to involve with farming profession. Subsequently, Nazmul has successfully cultivated this high-yield variety on 100 decimals of land. Nazmul, who is now self-reliant, shared his journey, explaining that he decided to move back to his village several years ago after realizing that a private company job in Dhaka was not fulfilling. Driven by an interest in agriculture, he chose to establish a papaya garden. He now earns a substantial income from the venture and employs two to four people who depend on the farm for their livelihood. Nazmul’s garden supplies papayas to various areas across the district, meeting the demand of the local Upazila. He sells more than 800 kilograms of ripe and unripe papaya monthly. On a weekly basis, his garden yields about 200 kilograms of papayas. The ‘Red Lady Papaya’ fetches a good price due to its high demand. Unripe papaya is sold at Taka 50 to Tk 60 a kilogram, while ripe papaya sells for Tk 100 to Tk 120 a kilogram. The widespread public interest in this specific variety stems from the fact that the fruit is very sweet and, once cut, the inside is a vivid, blood-red color. Nazmul confirmed that the earnings from this papaya garden fulfil all the needs of his family. Despite his success, Nazmul noted that water is the primary enemy of papaya cultivation. Given the amount of rainfall in the region, growing papayas can be challenging. He expressed interest in expanding his garden to a larger scale if he receives further government support. Nazmul urged the government for implementation of modern technology, such as the use of the greenhouse method. He believed that such aid would significantly improve papaya cultivation and encourage many others to take up the farming. Another entrepreneur of the area, Mehedi Hasan, 30, stated that Nazmul’s garden motivated him to start his own, and Nazmul assists him with guidance and advice. Mehedi is delighted with the ample yield of papayas from his new garden, which he and his family use both as fruit and as a vegetable. Another neighbour, Md Mujahid, 35, who previously only planted a couple of papaya saplings, was also inspired by Nazmul to establish his own garden. Mujahid now earns by selling papayas and meets his family’s fruit needs. He even gifts papayas to neighbours and relatives, who, in turn, are now venturing into papaya cultivation after seeing his example. Regarding support for these agricultural entrepreneurs, Md Milan, the Bauphal Upazila Agriculture Officer, confirmed that the office provides all necessary government facilities, including seeds and pesticides to farmers and young entrepreneurs like Nazmul.

{"title": "New Age | Riverine people begin cultivation on char land in Rangpur", "body": "Like previous years, this year too, riverine people have started cultivating various winter crops in the mixed-relay system in the char areas of the Brahmaputra basin in the Rangpur agricultural region. Officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension said that soon after recession of floodwater, char people started sowing crop seed on char lands and dried-up riverbeds following the appearance of shoals with deposition of highly fertile alluvial soils. Rangpur regional acting additional director of the DAE Krishibid Md Sirajul Islam said that people were cultivating various crops on around 82,000 hectares of char lands in Rangpur, Kurigram, Gaibandha, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari districts of the region every year. Hundreds of riverside and char people and farmers are producing about six-lakh tonnes of various crops worth Taka 1,200 crore from 82,000 hectares of char lands and dried-up riverbeds in Rangpur agricultural region annually. ‘Bumper production of varieties of crops in char lands during the winter season keeps the char economy vibrant bringing fortune to many people living there,’ Krishibid Sirajul Islam told BSS. Along with increasing food production by cultivating various crops on sandy char lands, char people are reaping rewarding profits from harvesting various crops every year to lead a better life. People are mostly cultivating potato, sweet pumpkin, sesame, linseed, squash, brinjal, onion, carrot, garlic, green chili, gourd, bitter gourd, banana, mustard, pulses, cauliflower, cabbage, mustard, sunflower, groundnut and wheat, maize, indigenous varieties of Boro rice and vegetables on char lands. The vast marshes, bottomlands and alluvial plains of the Brahmaputra, Teesta, Dharla, Dudhkumar, Ghaghot, Yamuna, Kartoa and other rivers will soon turn a striking green with the progress of winter crop cultivation. ‘They will begin harvesting their cultivated crops from late December to end the process before the commencement of the rainy season,’ Krishibid Sirajul Islam said. Deputy director of the DAE’s Burirhat Horticulture Centre in Rangpur city Krishibid Md Abu Sayem told BSS that people of char and riverine areas had put their maximum efforts in cultivating crops on their flood-hit char lands. Farming of winter crops is expanding every year on char lands in Rangpur agriculture region, mostly adopting intercropping and mixed-relay methods, benefiting hundreds of char people and bringing about a revolutionary change in the char agro-economy. ‘Getting assistance from the government, many char families have already achieved self-reliance through farming various crops on char lands changing their living standard and livelihoods in recent years,’ Sayem said. Soon after the recent flash flood, char people of villages Gannarpar, Buridangi, Singhimari, Miazipara, Motukpur, Kolkond, Bagdohra and Chhalapak of Gangachara upazila in Rangpur are becoming busy in cultivating crops on char lands. Talking to BSS, riverside and char people Mahbubul Islam, Mahbub Hossain and Anwar Hossain of village Paschim Mohipur in Gangachara upazila of Rangpur said that they were preparing to sow seeds of winter crops now on char lands like previous years. Nur Hossain of village Purbo Mohipur in the upazila cultivated maize, potato, garlic and onion on 1.50 acres of char lands on the dried-up Teesta riverbeds and got bumper yield last season. He is preparing to cultivate the same crop on the char land this year as well. Mahabbat Hossain, Abdul Malek and Abed Ali of Dhushmara Char in Kawnia upazila of Rangpur said that they were preparing to sow pumpkin seeds and potatoes on char lands now after earning lucrative profits by selling their produce last year. Jahanara Begum, Aklima Khatun and Akbar Hossain of village Char Montola and Afsar Ali of Char Goynar Patal in Chilmari upazila of Kurigram said that they were sowing seeds of various winter crops like ‘Khira’, green chilli, maize and other crops on char lands.

Fousseni and Alahassane Diakite, 33, opened a processing factory in August in their hometown of Divo, situated in a cocoa-dependent region some 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the economic capital Abidjan, with hopes of closing the gap. Stored in jute sacks, the beans are roasted to unleash their aroma, shelled, and then ground. The factory has a processing capacity of 36,000 tonnes annually, with a target of 80,000 tonnes. Comparatively, US giant Cargill, Switzerland’s Barry Callebaut, and Singapore’s Olam each process between 1,00,000 and 2,00,000 tonnes of cocoa annually in the west African nation. The twins’ added value lies in ‘the quality of our products, our services,’ and their story, they told AFP. Sons of a producer, ‘we are the pure products of Ivorian cocoa,’ said Fousseni, asserting that they are now realising their ‘dream’. ‘We were sure that what we were going to do was not just for us, but also to inspire other generations,’ he said. A few years after earning their high school diplomas, they created a union of cooperatives bringing together over 4,000 producers. They then founded their first company to create products for the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, such as cocoa butter, from the inedible parts of a cocoa pod. Later, a second company was launched to process cocoa for food products. Alahassane earned a business degree in Abidjan and has now pursued training at the HEC Paris business school. Fousseni, meanwhile, has taken up practical training in agroforestry and agronomy. ‘We complement each other,’ Alahassane said. While their cosmetic materials are exported ‘where there is demand’, he said, their chocolate for consumption is sold in Ivory Coast at competitive prices. In stores, most chocolate bars, often European brands, cost between 2,500 and 4,000 CFA francs ($4 to $7), while the brothers’ bar costs 1,200 francs ($2). Their small jar of spread is sold at the unbeatable price of 100 francs. At a time of growing demand for ethical products, ‘all our productions are traceable,’ assured Alahassane, while his brother specified that the factory’s machines run on renewable energy. Cocoa accounts for five million jobs in Ivory Coast, or one-sixth of the population. The government-set price of cocoa paid to growers is at a record level of 2,800 CFA francs per kilo. A few kilometres from Divo, in a shaded plantation carpeted with cocoa tree leaves, Kanga Prudence N’Guessan was cutting yellow pods with a machete. ‘Our wish... is not to send our cocoa outside our country... when processing is done there, it becomes two or three times more expensive,’ he said. At another plantation, 49-year-old grower Harouna Ouattara agreed, saying, ‘local processing is insufficient.’ ‘The first obstacle to cocoa processing is the issue of financing,’ explained Fousseni. Their factory cost nearly 50 million euros ($58 million), the brothers noted, without specifying the source of the funds. The second obstacle has been the lack of qualified labour. Still, the brothers said their factory has created 1,000 direct and indirect jobs, primarily for locals. Technical jobs are held by young people trained in major cities. Salimata Ouattara, a 35-year-old chemist, studied in the southern port city of San Pedro. In her white coat, between analyses, she said she wants to ‘help the youth here who don’t have much knowledge about industrialisation.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/agriculture/280053/ivorian-brothers-dream-of-transforming-cocoa-industry", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 628}
{"title": "New Age | Early Aman rice harvest boosts farm workers’ earnings", "body": "Like previous years, farmer laborers are earning well from early harvesting of short-term Aman rice to lead a better life during the ‘seasonal lean season’ of ‘Ashwin’ and ‘Kartik’ months in Rangpur agricultural region. Simultaneously, early harvesting of short-term Aman rice is helping small and marginal farmers to taste new rice and celebrate the ‘Nabanna Utsav’ in all five districts of Rangpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari in the region. Previously, an extreme poverty-like situation, locally called ‘Monga’, was being created for lack of agricultural activities during the months of ‘Aswin’ and ‘Kartik’, causing untold miseries to the poor and farm-laborers of Rangpur region. The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) officials said that the advance harvesting of short-duration Aman rice will continue till November for the entire lean period in the region. Additional Director of the DAE for Rangpur agricultural region Krishibid Md Sirajul Islam said early harvest of short duration Aman rice and followed by cultivation of early winter crops on the same land are creating huge jobs for farm-laborers every year. The DAE has fixed a target of producing 20,10,505 tonnes of clean Aman rice (30,15,757 tonnes in terms of paddy) from 6,20,430 hectares of land for the region. ‘The enthusiastic farmers have finally cultivated Aman rice on 6,21,505 hectares of land, 100.17 percent of the targeted land area,’ he said. Of them, farmers have cultivated short duration varieties of Aman rice on over 62,000 hectares of land in the region. Meanwhile, farmers have already harvested short duration Aman rice on about 2,500 hectares of land and got an average yield rate of 3.24 tonnes of clean Aman rice (4.86 tonnes of paddy) per hectare of land. ‘In addition to harvesting short-term Aman rice, farmers are cultivating early varieties of potatoes, mustard, vegetables and other winter crops on the same land to generate more profits along with creating huge jobs for farm-laborers,’ Krishibid Islam added. Independence Award 2018 Medal (food security) winner Dr MA Mazid said the government started expanded cultivation of short duration Aman rice from 2006 to create jobs for poor farm-laborers through early harvest during the ‘lean period’. The DAE, Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) and other organizations put maximum efforts on expanding short-duration Aman rice farming in 2006 to eliminate the seasonal unemployment situation from the region. Early harvest of short duration Aman rice followed by cultivation of subsequent winter crops on the same land till November creates huge jobs for farm-labourers relieving them from poverty. ‘As a result of large-scale cultivation of short duration Aman rice, the ‘Monga’-like situation during the ‘lean periods’ of ‘Aswin’ and ‘Kartik’ months, has been eliminated from the region,’ Dr Mazid added. Local farmers said they have mostly cultivated short duration rice varieties like BRRI dhan 90, BRRI dhan 95, BRRI dhan75, BRRI dhan71, BINA dhan17, BINA dhan16 and hybrid Hira-2, Hira-10 and Dhani Gold varieties of rice on croplands this season. Farmers Ariful Haque, Solaiman Ali, Latifur Rahman, Mokhlesur Rahman and Abu Bakar of different villages in Sadar and Pirganj upazilas of Rangpur said they have already harvested short duration Aman rice and got excellent yield. They are happy getting excellent market prices of newly harvested Aman paddy between Taka 1,250 and Taka 1,300 per mound (every 40 kilograms). ‘In addition to meeting our food needs with newly harvested rice, we are using raw rice straw as livestock feed. We are also earning a good income by selling raw rice straw as livestock feed at an affordable price,’ said farmer Ariful Haque.

{"title": "New Age | Warming climate helps UK grow rice", "body": "Wearing large rubber boots, Nadine Mitschunas joyfully handled mature rice plants peeking through the water of her small plot growing in the fertile soil of eastern England. Growing rice ‘has not been done before in the UK’, said Mitschunas, a field ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH). But as temperatures warm due to climate change, ‘it’s not such a crazy idea because it seems to work’, she added. As rice grows in eastern England, lemons groves and chickpeas are also cropping up in the south. A warmer climate and changing rainfall patterns have made planning ahead essential, and British researchers are embarking on a journey of agricultural transformation. Mitschunas is leading research with a project that tests new crops in the flat Fens of Cambridgeshire by rewetting peatlands. Its rich soil has facilitated high production levels, and the region now cultivates one third of England’s vegetables and 20 per cent of its potatoes and beetroots. But soil drainage gradually impoverishes the land, posing a threat to local farmers and releasing the CO2 captured by the peatland which are important carbon sinks. Craig and Sarah-Jane Taylor, the landowners participating in the UKCEH scheme, are conscious of the issue. ‘We recognise that our soils are depleting and that we need to change to secure the future,’ said Sarah-Jane Taylor, underlining the question of ‘water availability... and that’s only going to get worse’. The United Kingdom, like the rest of the world, is affected by climate change. It now has to contend with more frequent extreme weather, rising temperatures, and drier soil in some areas. A recent UKCEH study suggested that the growth of popular crops such as wheat and strawberries would become much more difficult over the coming decades if the climate warms by 2C. If temperatures rise by 4C, onion and oat crops would be hit. On the other hand, crops such as sunflower, durum wheat, soybean, chickpeas, lemon and okra could become more viable, particularly in southwestern England or near the Scottish coast. China and India are the world’s leading producers of rice. And in the Fens, Mitschunas has tested nine rice varieties regularly grown in the United States, the Philippines, Macedonia and Japan — four of them show promise, particularly one that originates from Colombia. Once the grains germinated in a laboratory, the seedlings were planted in water in June, and harvesting began in early October. ‘I am not eating my own rice yet,’ the ecologist joked. But such a scenario could become a reality within 10 years. ‘The suitable climate for rice is moving more northwards’ in Europe, she said, pointing to successful initiatives in the Netherlands and Germany. Mitschunas is also testing everything from lettuce and celery to pumpkins and strawberries — and even aromatic plants. Along with crop experimentation, her project aims to regenerate peatlands and improve the country’s CO2-capturing capacities. She is not the only British researcher testing new crops. At the University of Southampton in southern England, professor of biological sciences Mark Chapman is leading a study on different crops, including chickpea cultivation. ‘If we wait until 20 or 30 years, and then realise that we can’t grow wheat... like we always have done, we’ve then got (a) problem,’ he said. He emphasised the need to ‘smooth the transition’ by prioritising which future crops to grow and ensuring consumers are ready to change their habits. ‘I think we’re at that point where we just need to try more things,’ he said. ‘We need to get farmers involved, who are actually going to plant the crops.’ The pioneers in the Fens, Sarah-Jane and Craig Taylor, have noted other farmers’ growing interest in the project following their initial surprise. ‘Once upon a time potatoes and sugar beet weren’t grown here and now they’re one of the main crops in the area,’ said Sarah-Jane Taylor. ‘So why couldn’t rice potentially be an option here? And why shouldn’t we look at it?’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/agriculture/280746/warming-climate-helps-uk-grow-rice", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 688}
{"title": "New Age | Jhenaidah farmer finds success with mulching method", "body": "SUMMER WATERMELON New opportunities in off-season watermelon cultivation have emerged in Jhenaidah. Farmers are inspired to use this mulching method in the district. Local farmer, Abdur Rahim Badsha, has achieved remarkable success using the modern mulching method. His experimental summer watermelon field, located beside the Jhenaidah-Chuadanga road in the Holidhani block of Sadar upazila, has become a local attraction, drawing crowds eager to see the lush green vines and juicy fruits. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, Abdur Rahim planted watermelon seeds in early September on 52 percent of his land using the mulching technique to retain soil moisture. To protect the plants from pests, he also built lofts or sheds, where fresh watermelons now hang in abundance. ‘We have cultivated watermelon in 11 lofts using modern methods and harvested over 2,000 fruits so far,’ said Abdur Rahim, adding that each fruit weighs between 3 and 5 kilograms with excellent taste and colour. The farmer spent around Tk 40,000 on cultivation and has already sold fruits worth Tk 1,25,000, earning a net profit of up to Tk 80,000 in just two and a half months. A special inspection team from the Ministry of Agriculture recently visited the field under the project titled ‘Strengthening Nutrition and Food Security through Agricultural Development’. The delegation, led by Ferdousi Akhtar, joint head of crop wing, expressed satisfaction over the impressive yield and quality of the produce. Officials including additional deputy director (horticulture) Krishibid Md Selim Reza and sadar upazila agriculture officer Md Nur A Nabi praised the initiative, describing it as a model for other farmers. Md Nur A Nabi said, ‘This exceptional cultivation has opened new possibilities for summer watermelon farming in the district. We are motivating more farmers to adopt such profitable practices.’ Ferdousi Akhtar added, ‘As a short-term crop, summer watermelon can significantly boost farmers’ income. The government is committed to providing all necessary support to expand such innovative cultivation.’ With this success, Jhenaidah’s summer watermelon may soon become a symbol of smart, sustainable, and profitable agriculture across Bangladesh.

{"title": "New Age | Rangpur div set to produce 2.68 lakh tonnes of wheat", "body": "The Department of Agricultural Extension has set a target of producing 2,68,732 tonnes of winter wheat from 68,392 hectares of land for eight districts in two agricultural regions of Rangpur division in the current 2025-26 Rabi season. The DAE officials said that farmers produced 1,98,968 tonnes of wheat from 51,616 hectares of land in the past 2024-25 Rabi season in the Rangpur and Dinajpur agricultural regions of the division. However, the fixed farming target of wheat marked a little shortfall due to crop diversification and cultivation of vegetables, maize and other high-valued crops on more lands in the division last season. The set target for the current Rabi season includes production of 56,188 tonnes of wheat from 15,535 hectares of land in five districts of Rangpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari of Rangpur agricultural region. Besides, the target includes production of 2,12,544 tonnes of wheat from 52,857 hectares of land in three districts of Dinajpur, Thakurgaon and Panchagarh of Dinajpur agricultural region. ‘Farmers have already started preparing their croplands for sowing wheat seeds after harvesting Aman rice,’ said additional director of the DAE for Rangpur region Md Sirajul Islam. The process of sowing wheat seeds will get momentum with further progress in harvesting Aman rice crop in the division from next month. To make the wheat farming programme a success, the interim government through the DAE is distributing high quality wheat seeds, Di-ammonium Phosphate and Muriate of Potash fertilisers as special agriculture incentives among small and marginal farmers. The DAE, Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute and other agriculture-related organisations have taken ample steps to make the intensive wheat farming programme a success this season. ‘The authorities concerned have taken adequate measures to ensure supply of high quality wheat seeds, latest technologies, fertilisers and other inputs to farmers to promote cultivation of the cereal crop,’ Sirajul added. Farmers are mostly cultivating high yielding wheat varieties like ‘Bijoy’, ‘Pradip’, ‘Sotabdi’, BARI Gom25, BARI Gom26, BARI Gom27, BARI Gom28 and BARI Gom29 using conservation agriculture technologies to enhance production at reduced cost. Talking to BSS, Md Mamunur Rashid, a PhD fellow in the Department of Agricultural Extension at Dinajpur Haji Mohammad Danesh University of Science and Technology, said that farmers were mostly farming wheat adopting latest technologies in recent years. Adoption of the conservation agriculture-based strip tillage and bed planting methods in sowing wheat seeds using seeders machines largely increases wheat yield reducing need for irrigation compared to full tillage methods, largely saving labour costs. Formerly, wheat production was being affected due to adverse impacts of high temperature on its farming from flowering to ripening stages and late sowing of seeds after harvesting late varieties of Aman rice and use of low quality local seeds. ‘However, farmers are sowing high quality, disease resistant and stress tolerant varieties of wheat seeds timely using the lowest cost CA-based technologies after harvesting short duration Aman rice to get excellent production in recent years,’ Rashid said. Mamunur Rashid, also an environmental expert, praised the interim government for encouraging farmers to cultivate high-yielding wheat varieties using the latest technology for improved production and greater profits. Talking to BSS, farmers Lutfar Rahman, Akmal Hossain, Ariful Haque, Golzar Rahman and Mohsin Ali of different villages in Rangpur Sadar upazila said that they were preparing to sow wheat seeds on their croplands after harvesting Aman rice.

{"title": "New Age | Family gardens boost livelihoods in Dumuria", "body": "Family nutrition gardens are opening new opportunities for farmers in Dumuria upazila of Khulna by ensuring proper use of homestead land and strengthening safe food security at the household level. These gardens are not only meeting daily vegetable needs but also enabling families to earn additional income by selling surplus produce, giving a fresh boost to the rural economy. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension, more than 500 family nutrition gardens have been established in two phases across nine upazilas of Khulna under the project titled ‘Establishment of Family Nutrition Gardens on Unused Fallow Land and Homestead Areas.’ Beneficiary households have already begun harvesting vegetables from gardens designed following the Kalikapur model. DAE sources said that selected families received two days of training — either both husband and wife or one of them participated — to improve their garden management skills. After the training, each garden is set up on one and a half decimals of homestead land with five north-south-oriented beds and trellises on both sides. Beds are cultivated with red amaranth, beetroot, carrot, spinach, water spinach, Malabar spinach, stem amaranth, coriander, green chili, radish and other seasonal vegetables, while trellises support gourd, pumpkin, hyacinth bean, yardlong bean and ridge gourd. Fruit saplings such as Thai guava, wood apple, jujube and chui jhal have been planted at the garden edges. The design ensures year-round vegetable and fruit availability. The government provides seeds, fertilisers and saplings free of cost, while farmers maintain the gardens. DAE has planned to establish 100 nutrition gardens in every union of the district in phases. Speaking to BSS, farmer Nabadwip Mondal of Baratia village under Dumuria upazila said that he had harvested monsoon-season vegetables with satisfactory yields. His garden meets his family’s vegetable needs for 15-20 days at a time, and he sells the surplus. His yard is now filled with bottle gourd, spinach, snake gourd, bitter gourd, pumpkin, cucumber, okra, beans, red amaranth, tomato, chili, eggplant, papaya and even medicinal plants like pennywort. ‘This type of agro-garden can be a model for women in coastal areas,’ he added. Another farmer Fahrad Hossain of the same area said he no longer needs to buy vegetables from the market after establishing his garden, while Hanif Mollah of Kharnia said that although he cultivated vegetables earlier, he had never grown them in such a planned manner. His garden now meets his family’s needs and he expects to earn extra income. Farmers’ groups are also holding monthly meetings and training sessions where women exchange farming knowledge, share seeds and operate collective savings schemes. They receive training on nutrition, food safety, environmental conservation and organic farming-turning the initiative into a platform for women’s empowerment and leadership. Dumuria upazila sub-assistant agriculture officer Nurun Nahar said that the nutrition gardens were helping families meet year-round vegetable demand while generating income from surplus produce. Dumuria upazila agriculture officer Md Insad Ibn Amin said that the initiative aimed to ensure that ‘not even an inch of land remains uncultivated,’ as fallow homestead areas were gradually brought under production. Khulna DAE deputy director Md Nazrul Islam said that the project ensures proper used of fallow land and can meet half of the annual vegetable requirement of a four-member family. ‘Women have been included in the training so they can maintain the gardens alongside household responsibilities,’ he added. Md Rafiqul Islam, additional director of Khulna Agriculture Zone, said that many farmers were benefiting financially after meeting household needs. DAE is providing all necessary agro-inputs, including training, seeds and saplings, he said.

They said that BRRI Dhan 103, developed by the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute, was proving highly profitable for farmers due to its strong plants and resistance to lodging even under heavy rainfall. The demonstration and sample collection were held on the field of farmer Ziaur Rahman at Kunza Nakaihat village under Nakaihat Union on Thursday. Sub-assistant agriculture officer Ziaul Haque Rintu, farmer Ziaur Rahman and local resident Sayem Miah addressed the programme, among others. After harvesting the crop in presence of local farmers and officials, it was found that about 20 maunds of paddy were produced from a bigha of land. The yield impressed the attending farmers, who expressed willingness to cultivate the variety in the coming seasons. Earlier, SAAO Rintu briefed farmers on the cultivation methods of BRRI Dhan 103, describing it as a high-yielding and farmer-friendly variety. A large number of farmers, invited guests and media representatives were present at the event.

{"title": "New Age | Patuakhali’s date juice tradition at risk amid farmer crisis", "body": "The cherished tradition of date juice in Patuakhali is under threat as production continues to decline. Locals fear that this winter heritage may vanish, with field data showing the number of date trees in the southern coastal region has fallen by nearly half over the past decade. As a result, the seasonal production of juice and jaggery has been disrupted, creating a supply shortage in local markets. Despite rising demand, producers are struggling to secure financial gains due to dwindling output. According to the district’s Department of Agricultural Extension, there are currently 1,28,035 date trees in the district. Last season, jaggery production amounted to only 4.1 tonnes. Officials noted that molasses output had been comparatively low since much of the juice was sold directly on the market. Farmers described the decline vividly. Abdul Karim of Bauphal Upazila recalled that from his 30-35 trees, he once collected 15–20 litres of juice daily. Now, with only 16 trees, he gets just 4-6 litres. ‘The price has risen to Tk 100-120 per litre from Tk 50-60 earlier, but reduced production means profits are far less than before,’ he said. Professional juice collector, also called gachi, Shamsul Hawlader of Dashmina Upazila shared that seasonal Patali jaggery output has dropped from 200-250 kilogram to just 50-70 kilogram. Currently, Patali sells for Tk 300-350 per kilogram and Nalen for Tk 450-500, but limited supply hampers business. Young farmer Chhamim Mridha of Kalapara Upazila explained that three products — Nalen jaggery, Patali jaggery, and date sugar — are made from juice. ‘Demand is rising, but shortages of skilled gachi and juice prevent us from expanding production,’ he said. Golachipa’s Alam Khan added that his daily Nalen jaggery production had fallen from 8-10 kilogram to only 2-3 kilogram. ‘Wholesalers from Dhaka and Barisal place advance orders, but we cannot deliver due to low supply,’ he lamented. Small farmer Rokon Uddin of Mirzaganj reported that his trees have dwindled from more than 30 to just 8, cutting his seasonal income nearly by half. Producers believe recovery is possible through salinity control, planting new trees, proper training, and improved market management. Rabeya Khatun Kochi, assistant teacher at Baufal Daspara Model Government Primary School, said: ‘Date juice is part of our winter tradition. But with fewer farmers and trees, the tradition is at risk. If this continues, future generations may never know the true taste and joy of date juice.’ Former Baufal Press Club president Kamruzzaman Bachchu said: ‘The decline in date juice production affects not only farmers and producers but also the local economy and culture. Without coordinated government initiatives, preserving this tradition has become difficult.’ Officials acknowledged the challenges. Bauphal upazila agriculture officer Md Milon told BSS that rising coastal salinity, neglected trees and a shortage of skilled workers were key reasons for the decline. ‘We are encouraging new plantations and planning to train tree workers in the coming season. With modern tube technology, sap extraction could increase by 20-30 per cent,’ he said. Talking to BSS, Bauphal upazila nirbahi officer Aminul Islam said: ‘The administration is working with the Agriculture Department to sustain date cultivation. We will offer support and incentives for planting, production, and training.’ DAE deputy director Md Amanul Islam told the news agency that most date trees grew naturally, with few being deliberately planted. ‘Due to inexperience, many trees are cut down unnecessarily. Rising fuel costs have also reduced jaggery production, pushing farmers to sell raw juice instead. This threatens the traditional khejur gur processing,’ he explained. ‘Planting new date trees is essential to preserve this tradition,’ he said, adding that the government was already advancing plantation activities through various incentives and programmes.

{"title": "New Age | 37.25 lakh tonnes of boro rice expected in Rajshahi division", "body": "Around 37.25 lakh tonnes of IRRI-Boro rice is expected to be produced from 8.19 lakh hectares of land in all eight districts of the division during the current season, officials said. The Department of Agricultural Extension has set the target of producing 17.23 lakh tonnes of rice from 3.66 lakh hectares of land in four districts of Rajshahi Agricultural Zone, while 20.02 lakh tonnes from 4.53 lakh hectares in four other districts of Bogura Agricultural Zone. This year, the DAE has set a target of developing seedbeds on about 40,209 hectares of land including high yielding varieties in the division. Meanwhile, the farmers are nursing and caring for the seedbeds of the paddy, braving the winter weather and fog at present. Azizur Rahman, additional director of the DAE, said that all the district, upazila and field level officials and others concerned were giving suggestions to the farmers to protect their seedbeds from cold covering their seedbeds with polythene at night. He said that they were adopting all possible measures to ensure food security through attaining the rice production target everywhere in the region including its vast Barind tract to ensure food security. Monimul Haque, a farmer of Premtali village under Godagari upazila, said that he had prepared seedbeds on 25 decimals of land for cultivating paddy on 18 bigha of land this season. He is now hopeful of starting the transplantation of seedlings within the next one month. Monimul has adopted some preventive measures to protect the seedbeds from any cold related diseases. Regional office of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute has taken diversified steps including farmers training, projection plot and supplying of the newly developed high yielding varieties among the growers to make IRRI-Boro farming a total success. BRRI has developed 14 Boro varieties of paddy which are appropriate for Rajshahi region including its vast Barind tract, said Muhammad Hossain, chief scientific officer of BRRI. The varieties are BRRI dhan28, 29, 50, 58, 63, 69, 81, 84, 86, 88, 89, 92, BRRI hybrid dhan3 and BRRI hybrid dhan5. Of those, BRRI dhan50 is export-oriented premium quality rice, BRRI dhan58 is comparatively high yielding and Brridhan84 is iron and zinc-enriched. Hossain said that the field level agriculture officials, researchers and scientists were reaching the developed varieties to the farmers’ doorsteps so that they can boost the Boro paddy yield after the best uses of the varieties. The conventional varieties are being replaced by modern varieties which are good signs for the region in terms of boosting yield, he said. The BRRI chief scientific officer said that there was no way but to enhance rice production through facing the existing challenges of adverse impact of climate change with gradually declining resources and agriculture manpower. However, the grassroots farmers are happy after getting better yield and market price of their harvested rice contributing a lot towards ensuring food security in the region for the last couple of years.

{"title": "New Age | Chandpur’s winter harvest eases burden on plates", "body": "As winter sets in, consumers in Chandpur are finding a welcome relief on kitchen markets, as prices of winter vegetables see a modest decline, particularly benefiting low-income groups. Vendors in the coastal district said that this year’s price correction was a departure from previous trends, attributing the stability to the absence of syndicates that traditionally caused sudden spikes. ‘If this situation continues, it could provide lasting relief for consumers,’ a local vendor told UNB. Agriculturists echoed this observation, noting that last year, potato prices had surged to Tk 80 a kilogram, while high-quality potatoes are now available at Tk 22–25 a kilogram. Other vegetables have also become more affordable: papaya is selling at Tk 25-30 a kilogram and lower-quality potatoes are offered at six to seven kilograms for Tk 100 in van markets across neighbourhoods. Similar pricing patterns are evident in the district town’s roadside markets, including Wireless, Baburhat, Bohoria, Mahamaya, Bakila and Munshirhat in Matlab. Over the past fortnight, fresh winter vegetables such as bottle gourd, ridge gourd, black eggplant, pointed gourd, chichinga, okra, and cucumber have seen price reductions of Tk 10-15 a kilogram, now retailing at Tk 45-50 a kilogram. Other staples include radish at Tk 40 per kilogram, fresh cauliflower at Tk 35-40 apiece, and smaller cabbages at Tk 40 each. Bitter gourd remains relatively expensive at Tk 80-90 a kilogram, green chilli is Tk 80, coriander leaves Tk 30-40, medium-sized bottle gourd Tk 40, and carrots Tk 120 a kilogram. Local tomatoes sell for Tk 100-120 a kilogram, taro at Tk 40-50, and leafy vegetables such as red amaranth, pumpkin, kolmi, pointed gourd, and radish are priced between Tk 20-30 a kilogram. Onion prices have fallen to Tk 50 per kilogram. Traders in the city’s busiest market, Biponibag, including Juel Mia, Jahangir Khan, Iqbal Bepari, and Abul Kalam Bepari, expect prices to fall further in the coming days. Observations across other prominent district markets, such as Palbazar, New Market, Puranbazar, Wireless Market, and Biponibag, confirm this trend. Vegetable vendors selling directly from vans are offering produce at Tk 5-10 lower per kilogram than retail shops, attracting crowds of low-income buyers, especially in the evenings. Each morning, large quantities of fresh vegetables arrive via trawlers from remote char areas in Matlab Uttar, Chandpur Sadar, and Haimchar, including Raj Rajeshwar, Char Ibrahim, Harina, Char Kashim, Kanudi and Bishnupur. Despite the ample supply, the lack of government regulation in retail markets keeps prices higher than production costs. Mohammad Mobarak Hossain, an agricultural officer at the Department of Agricultural Extension in Chandpur, told UNB that authorities have no power to control market prices. He said winter vegetable cultivation targets cover 6,100 hectares, aiming for a total production of 1,34,200 tonnes. Vegetables are grown across nearly 12,000 hectares along riverbanks and chars, with additional supply coming from neighbouring districts. ‘There is no shortage of winter vegetables,’ he emphasised. The current price trend provides a glimmer of hope for consumers, signalling a more stable market for winter staples this season.

Deputy commissioner Mohammad Kamal Hossain inaugurated the fair, organised by the Department of Agricultural Extension. Following the inauguration, the deputy commissioner visited the 12 stalls set up at the venue, where he highlighted the nutritional value of various fruits and vegetables displayed at the fair. He also discussed the adverse effects of excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, urging farmers and visitors to adopt safer and more sustainable agricultural practices. A discussion meeting was later held at the Muktamancha, presided over by Masudur Rahman Sarkar, deputy director of the DAE. Additional deputy director Krishna Roy delivered the welcome speech. Addressing the programme as the chief guest, deputy commissioner Mohammad Kamal Hossain stressed the importance of proper food preparation to retain essential nutrients. ‘Most of the food we eat daily is home-cooked, yet many people do not consider how to preserve its nutritional value during cooking,’ he said. He also noted that the common practice of polishing rice removed its nutrient-rich husk, resulting in the loss of 70-80 per cent of its nutritional value. ‘This nutritional value must be ensured,’ he added. Civil surgeon Dr Hadi Ziauddin Ahmed, district livestock officer Sahabuddin, and convener of Anti-Discrimination Student Movement Aslam Hossain Ark also spoke on the occasion.

{"title": "New Age | Hundreds of dairy farmers gather for just an hour of trade", "body": "DUMURIA MILK MARKET At the break of dawn, when dense winter fog still blankets the fields and the sun struggles to rise over Dumuria, a rare rural market bursts into life for just a single hour. Known locally as the Dumuria milk market, the bazaar is located near Bara Ani Bazar, about 25 kilometres west of Khulna city, and has evolved into a vital lifeline for hundreds of small dairy farmers who gather each morning with bottles of fresh milk. By 6:00am, long before daylight fully appears, more than a hundred milk sellers — mostly smallholders from neighbouring villages such as Tipna, Bamuandia, Khajura and Mirzapur — take their designated spots. Carrying milk from indigenous-breed cows reared on natural feed, they begin calling out prices as buyers — including household consumers and traditional dairy processors (Ghosh) — move from one seller to another. Within an hour, usually by 7:00am, the entire market activity comes to a close, and sellers pack up their empty cans and head home with cash in hand. Over the decades, the milk market has evolved into a community hub where milk trading is accompanied by the sale of fresh vegetables, fish, poultry and other essentials. Though brief, the gathering resembles a festive meeting point for villagers across several unions, locals said. Local Union Parishad chairman Gazi Humayun Kabir Bulu, 70, told BSS that the origins of the market dated back to the mid-1960s. ‘In 1964, the milk market began to form naturally. At that time, communication infrastructure was poor. People travelled by boats along canals to bring goods. The crowd of buyers and sellers made this milk market well-known,’ he said. With improved road networks and new marketplaces emerging in recent decades, the scale of the old bazaar declined. ‘Still, it survives because of milk trading,’ he added. According to local people, between 100 and 150 sellers bring 10-12 maunds of milk daily. Prices range from Tk 1,600 to Tk 2,000 per maund. On average, milk worth Tk 16,000 to Tk 20,000 is sold each day, amounting to nearly Tk 4-5 lakh a month and as much as Tk 57-60 lakh annually. Sellers do not have to pay any toll or market fee. Farmers like Harendra, 75, and Mohsin, 55, said that they raise six cows, of which two were currently lactating, producing three to four kilograms of milk each. ‘We sell milk at Tk 40 to Tk 60 a kilogram. Since the market is close to our village, we can sell easily every morning,’ said Mohsin. Talking to BSS, Abdul Wadud, 65, who owns four cows, said that he sells four to five kilograms of milk a day, benefiting from steady demand. ‘Our cows eat natural fodder — grass, straw, khoil. We do not use harmful feed. So the milk quality is good,’ he said. Buyers also attest to this claim. Shyamal Das, Shamsuzzaman Sentu, Mehedi Hasan and several other regular buyers said that milk sold at the Dumuria market was pure and typically free of adulteration. ‘Compared to other areas, prices are lower here and the quality is better,’ said Shyamal. The market has also become an important source for traditional sweet-makers. Santosh Ghosh of Telikhali village said that he bought milk there because chhana turned out superior when made from indigenous-breed cow milk. ‘For good quality sweets, we rely on Dumuria’s milk,’ he added. Several Ghosh families, including Bishu and Kalu Ghosh, collect milk here throughout the year. Local people said that dairy farming had reshaped the local economy over the past decade. Growing demand for milk has encouraged many families to rear cows, making households more self-reliant. ‘Every home in these villages has at least one or two indigenous cows. People are earning regularly from milk,’ said Nurul Islam of Khajura village. According to the Dumuria Livestock Office, the upazila targeted 25,000 tonnes of milk production for FY 2023–24. Monthly production is already around 2,170 tonnes, and officials expect total output to exceed 64,600 tonnes — more than 5,400 tonnes above target. Talking to BSS, Upazila Livestock Officer Md Ashraful Kabir said, ‘We provide regular veterinary services, medicines and guidance to farmers so they can rear cows properly and remain protected from diseases.’ Contacted last week, the immediate past Dumuria UNO, Md Zahurul Islam, told BSS that the milk market was a model for grassroots economic progress. ‘Through morning milk trading, hardworking families are earning and meeting local demand at affordable prices. The administration will continue supporting livestock development,’ he said.

{"title": "New Age | French almond makers revive traditions to counter US dominance", "body": "The scent of marzipan wafts through the air as confectioners from a century-old company in southern France prepare calissons, one of Provence’s famed sweets made of candied melon and crushed almonds. French producers have over the past decade sought to revive almond production, and the traditional gourmet treat first introduced in Provence under King Rene in the 15th century is now increasingly made with locally grown almonds. Provence — where almond blossoms famously inspired artists including Vincent Van Gogh — was once a key almond-growing region. But production declined in the mid-20th century, with the overnight frost of 1956 devastating orchards. While the vast majority of almonds are grown in the United States, French producers have sought to hold their ground against US competitors, aiming to position the locally grown almonds in a premium segment and promote environmental awareness. ‘I bet — even without being Pierre Herme, the best pastry chef in the world — that if you taste an American almond and then a Province-grown almond, you’ll notice the difference in flavour immediately,’ said Alexis Bertucat, communications director for Le Roy Rene, a confectionery company. Le Roy Rene, which is based in the city of Aix-en-Provence, uses around 50 tonnes of locally grown almonds a year to make treats such as calissons and nougat. When the company was bought in 2014 by Olivier Baussan, founder of the L’Occitane en Provence chain of cosmetics and beauty products, it imported American and Spanish almonds, said Bertucat. But the idea to grow its own almonds and revive a tradition going back to the 15th century quickly took hold. ‘The reason we make calissons in Aix-en-Provence is because there used to be almond producers all over the place,’ said Bertucat. He said that thanks to the work of farmers in Provence — ‘their irrigation methods, the way they treat the trees very lightly, or rather focus on creating living soil’ — the almonds they use have a high fat content. ‘When it’s combined with candied fruit and sugar, it produces a very distinctive flavour.’ The company says it was also driven by economic and environmental concerns. ‘If we use almonds that are closer to home, we reduce our carbon footprint,’ said Bertucat. France now has more than 2,700 hectares of almond trees, according to official figures. Production of shelled almonds stands at around 1,200 tonnes a year, dwarfed by the 50,000 tonnes of imported nuts. One of producers, Francois Moulias, said that the local harvest would continue to increase but would still remain low in relation to the global market. ‘We would need 50,000 hectares of almond trees to cover our needs,’ he said. In 2018, he co-founded La Compagnie des Amandes with former government minister Arnaud Montebourg, which helps farmers to plant almond trees on their land. The company now cultivates 230 hectares of groves in southern France. ‘With our more virtuous agricultural practices, we cannot achieve the same yields as the Americans,’ said Moulias, pointing out that French almonds use ‘five times less water’ than those grown in California. A processing plant was launched in October, which supplies high-end pastry makers such as Laduree and supermarkets as well as the cosmetics industry. In 2011, cherry producer Fabien Dauphin began growing almonds to diversify crops. He is following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, who owned almond trees before the devastating frost of 1956. Dauphin, who is the president of the Provence almond producers’ union, owns 22 hectares of almond trees in the village of Cucuron. Almond production accounts for half of his income, thanks in particular to online and market sales. ‘It’s still a niche market. Our customers are often people with high purchasing power,’ he said. Dauphin is also considering branching out into pistachio production, which is still in its infancy in France. ‘They’re really two twin industries: we need the same equipment and, above all, we have the same customers,’ he said.

After getting bumper output with lucrative prices in recent years, hundreds of char and riverside people are expanding pumpkin cultivation on char land and dried-up riverbeds to change fortunes in the Brahmaputra basin of the region. Officials of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) said char people and farmers are farming pumpkins with other winter crops adopting mixed-relay and intercropping methods to reap more profits. ‘Char residents, farmers and riverside people are continuing to sow pumpkin seeds and other Rabi crops on char lands and dried-up riverbeds,’ additional director (Incharge) of the DAE for Rangpur region Krishibid Md Shirajul Islam said. The DAE, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) and different NGOs are extending assistance to char people to promote crop cultivation on sandy char lands and dried-up riverbeds this time like in the previous years. Inspired by officials and experts from the DAE and other agriculture-related organizations and NGO workers to increase food production amid the adverse effects of climate change, people are bringing more char land under crop cultivation. Amidst the favorable climate, tender plants of early varieties of pumpkin are growing exceptionally well in the char lands, predicting a bumper production this season, which will bring more profits to the char people and make them self-reliant. ‘Harvesting of early varieties of pumpkin will begin in the pastures and dry riverbeds from the third week of this month, while sowing of winter crops including vegetables is still ongoing in all five districts of the region,’ Islam added. According to riverbank and char people, the DAE, RDRS Bangladesh, Plan Action Bangladesh and many other NGOs have popularised pumpkin cultivation in dried-up riverbeds and char lands over the past decade to change their fate. Talking to BSS, Nur Islam, Anwar Hossain, Kobiza Khatun, Abdur Razzaque and Mahbub Alam of Char Paschim Mohipur village in Gangachara upazila of Rangpur narrated their success stories of attaining self-reliance through farming pumpkins. They are expanding cultivation of pumpkin adopting mixed relay and intercropping methods with onion, garlic, banana, vegetables, green chili, squash, potato, brinjal, sweet potato and other Rabi crops on the sandy char lands and dried-up riverbeds this season. Couple Shahinur Islam and Fancy Begum of Char Purbo Mohipur of Gangachara upazila said they have cultivated various crops like pumpkin, ‘Khira’, green chilli, maize and other crops on two acres of the dried-up beds of the Teesta this time. ‘We earn a very good profit from pumpkin farming every year and are expecting to start harvesting the same from the third week of this month to earn well again,’ Shahinur told BSS. Aminul Islam and Ummey Kulsum, a couple from Char Taluk Shahbaz village in Kawnia upazila of Rangpur, said that they are expecting a bumper harvest this time while tending to tender pumpkin plants in the char area. ‘We have cultivated pumpkin, groundnut, onion, garlic and vegetables on two acres of sandy char lands on dried-up beds of the Teesta,’ said Ummey Kulsum said, adding that they will start harvesting pumpkin from this month-end to reap rewarding profit.

{"title": "New Age | Record 1.12cr tonnes of potatoes produced this year: adviser", "body": "2-day Potato Festival begins Agriculture adviser Lieutenant General (retired) Md Jahangir Alam Chowdhury on Thursday said that a record 1.12 crore tonnes of potatoes had been produced this year, about 22 lakh tonnes more than the national demand. ‘In 2025, the production cost of potatoes varies between Tk 14 and Tk 17 a kilogram depending on the region. Including storage, transportation, sacks, labour and other expenses, the cost at the cold storage gate stands at Tk 20-25 a kilogram. In contrast, farmers are being forced to sell potatoes at Tk 8-16 a kilogram at the cold storage gate-far below their production cost-leading to financial losses,’ he said. In view of this situation, the adviser requested the Bangladesh Cold Storage Association to preserve old potatoes for some more time to help farmers recover their losses, a press release said. He made the request while speaking as chief guest at the two-day ‘Potato Festival 2025’ organised by the Bangladesh Cold Storage Association at International Convention Centre Bashundhara in the capital on the day. Agriculture secretary Mohammad Emdad Ullah Mian, Bangladesh Agricultural University vice-chancellor AK Fazlul Haque Bhuiya and ambassador of the Kingdom of Netherlands to Bangladesh Joris Van Bommel attended the ceremony as special guests. BCSA president Mostafa Azad Chowdhury Babu presided over the ceremony. Jahangir said that the Cold Storage Association had been urged to continue preserving old potatoes to offset the losses faced by growers, adding that new potatoes would take an additional 15 days to arrive on the market this year. ‘Therefore, the decision has been taken in the greater interest of farmers,’ he said. ‘Although storage owners may incur some losses due to increased electricity bills, the farmers, who are the backbone of food production, will benefit,’ he added. The adviser also called upon the concerned authorities to take necessary measures to reduce production costs per kilogram of potatoes. He further said that although Bangladesh produced potatoes in large quantities, the country lagged behind in the processing industry. Only two per cent of potatoes are processed in Bangladesh, compared with seven per cent in many other countries, he said. Therefore, he stressed the need to prioritise potato processing and select varieties suitable for processing. The adviser added that imported potato seed packets must have clearly marked prices, which will benefit farmers. BCSA senior vice-president Ishtiak Ahmed, vice-president and board member Mohammad Yunus, NürnbergMesse Fima Exhibition (Hangzhou) company Limited, China general manager Tony Lv, Postmaster Communication managing director Faizul Alam, among others, attended the ceremony. The Potato Festival 2025 is designed to promote multifaceted use of potatoes as food in Bangladesh, formulate strategies to increase exports, enhance modern storage technologies and expand potato processing industries. The exhibition was attended by prominent business leaders from the agriculture, potato production, cold chain and food processing sectors, along with potato farmers and the general public. Nearly 500 farmers from across the country are participating in this international fair. In his speech, Mostafa Azad announced that 10 exemplary farmers, selected from various districts, would be honoured on the closing day of the event. A total of 66 local and international organisations are participating in this international exhibition, showcasing equipment for modern potato cultivation, advanced cold storage technologies, processing solutions, value addition, export opportunities, cold-chain systems, agricultural machinery and various potato-based food products. During the exhibition, international B2B meetings and two expert-led panel sessions were held, focusing on increasing domestic consumption of potatoes, enhancing exports and strengthening value addition. The recommendations from these panel sessions will be submitted to the relevant government ministries for necessary action. Postmaster Communication is serving as the event partner of the fair.

{"title": "New Age | Migrant’s successful venture into orange farming in Shibchar", "body": "Young entrepreneur Russell Hossain has emerged as a successful example of orange farming in Shibchar upazila of the district, creating new opportunities for agriculture-based employment after returning home from abroad. Russell has transformed his family’s hobby garden into a profitable orange orchard in the Dattapara Mridhakandi area of the upazila. At a time when many returnee expatriates struggle to find employment, his initiative has drawn attention for demonstrating how modern farming practices can ensure sustainable income. The journey began six years ago when Russell’s father Shawkat Hossain planted 60 small-variety orange saplings on about one and a half bigha of land. Initially, the orchard did not attract much interest due to low yields. However, after Russell took charge of the orchard in late 2021, the scenario changed significantly. By studying citrus cultivation online, consulting with the agriculture department and adopting modern techniques, Russell improved fertilizer and irrigation management, pest and disease control, pruning and soil development. As a result, the orchard flourished in 2024, producing high-quality oranges. Although production slightly declined this year due to weather variations, Russell said the taste and quality have improved. ‘The sourness has reduced and sweetness has increased, which has boosted demand,’ he said. Oranges from the garden are currently selling at Taka 280 to 300 per kilogram in both wholesale and retail markets, with many buyers visiting the orchard directly. Local resident Emon Hossain told BSS that Russell’s success would inspire young people in the area to engage in agriculture instead of remaining unemployed. Another visitor, Mohsin Talukder, praised the orchard, saying the quantity and taste of oranges this year were impressive. Buyers said the orchard has gained popularity as a reliable source of locally produced, formalin-free oranges. The fruit is also sold online, attracting customers from different parts of the country. Sharing his future plans, Russell said oranges are cultivated on about 1 bigha 33 decimal of land, alongside malta, guava and other fruits. ‘If we receive government support, it will be possible to expand on a larger scale,’ he added. Shibchar Upazila Agriculture Officer Rafiqul Islam said the department is providing regular advice to local entrepreneurs. ‘We are distributing quality seedlings, promoting modern technology and facilitating agricultural credit. Citrus fruit cultivation is becoming increasingly popular in this region,’ he said. According to the local agriculture department, cultivation of perennial fruits such as orange, malta and lemon has been rising in Shibchar in recent years. Russell Hossain’s success has not only increased his family income but also inspired local youth to view agriculture as a viable and promising profession.

{"title": "New Age | Suman Mia succeeds in watermelon farming in Jamuna char lands", "body": "After achieving success in cultivating maize and almonds, a young farmer of Bhuiyanpur upazila in Tangail has now created a new example by successfully cultivating watermelon in the char areas along the Jamuna River. Suman Mia, 28, a degree student of Bhuiyanpur Government Ibrahim Khan College, has successfully cultivated yellow watermelon on five bighas of char land in Faldapara river erosion area of Gabsara. His initiative has brought fresh hope to local farmers who once considered these sandy lands unsuitable for anything other than risky crops like tobacco. Traditionally, farmers in the char areas of Bhuiyanpur depended mainly on almonds, maize or tobacco due to frequent river erosion and uncertainty in cultivation. Suman Mia decided to experiment with watermelon cultivation after learning techniques from YouTube. ‘I was fascinated after watching watermelon cultivation videos online. Inspired, I decided to try it myself,’ Suman Mia told BSS. ‘I managed five bighas of unused land and planted Tripti, Madhumala and Pakija varieties. Altogether, I have about 5,000 watermelon plants.’ According to Suman, Tripti and Madhumala varieties are yellow on the outside, while Pakija is green-skinned but red inside. The fruits are sweet, juicy and weigh around 5–7 kilograms each. He invested nearly Taka 6 lakh and expects to earn around Taka 5 lakh in profit from this single harvest. Watermelon is a winter crop that only needs three months to mature. ‘The fruits have already developed well and harvesting will begin within a week,’ he said, adding that the produce is poison-free and ready for market. Suman’s success has attracted widespread attention. People from nearby villages are visiting his fields, and many farmers have expressed interest in adopting watermelon cultivation in the coming seasons. At least 10 farmers who previously grew tobacco in the char areas have already shown willingness to switch to watermelon cultivation next year. According to the District Agricultural Extension Department, farmers in Tangail are cultivating three varieties of watermelon on about four hectares of char land this year across Bhuiyanpur, Nagarpur, Kalihati and Sadar upazilas. Interest in off-season watermelon cultivation is increasing due to higher market prices and lower production costs. Bhuiyanpur Upazila Agriculture Officer Mokhlesur Rahman said that Golden Crown, a relatively new off-season watermelon variety, is gaining popularity. ‘Though yellow on the outside, it is red inside, nutritious and delicious. It yields well and fetches good prices in the market,’ he said. He added that the Agriculture Office is providing monitoring and advisory support to encourage farmers to expand cultivation of this profitable crop. ‘With proper training and government incentives, watermelon cultivation in char areas can significantly improve farmers’ livelihoods and help meet national demand,’ he said. Local farmers believe that Suman Mia’s success has opened a new door for sustainable agriculture in the Jamuna char regions, transforming once-risky lands into promising sources of income.

{"title": "New Age | Wheat cultivation target set at 7,275 hectares in Dinajpur", "body": "The Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) has set a target to cultivate wheat on 7,275 hectares of land in the district during the current season, aiming to boost production and meet the country’s growing demand. Deputy director of DAE Md. Afzal Hossain said the cultivation target covers all 13 upazilas of the district, with a production goal of 3.75 metric tons per hectare. If the target is achieved, total wheat production in the district is expected to reach around 25,650 metric tons. Md. Afzal Hossain said that the weather conditions this season are favorable for wheat cultivation. He expressed optimism that, barring any natural disasters, production may exceed the set target. Farmers began cultivating early wheat varieties such as BARI-25, BARI-26 and BARI-27 from November 15, and the crops have already sprouted. Wheat varieties including BARI-27, 28, 30, 31 and 32 will continue to be sown until December 31. Following the harvest of Aman paddy, farmers have been busy preparing land using organic manure and cow dung to increase yields. High-yielding wheat seeds, particularly BARI-30, 31 and 32, have been supplied by the Department of Agriculture, with the expected yield set at 3.75 tons per hectare. To support cultivation, irrigation facilities using electric-powered machines have been ensured. Drainage systems have also been installed in advance to protect crops from potential damage caused by storms or heavy rainfall. The deputy director added that the initiative is part of a broader effort to reduce dependence on wheat imports. The Wheat Research Institute is supplying improved high-yielding seed varieties, while agricultural field workers are providing continuous guidance to farmers across the district. In recent years, wheat cultivation has expanded beyond highlands to include medium lands and river-side char areas. According to agriculture department sources, wheat was cultivated on 6,210 hectares in Dinajpur last year, producing 23,287 metric tons at an average yield of 3.75 tons per hectare.

{"title": "New Age | Farmers sell cauliflower at Tk 5 a kg, consumers pay Tk 40 a piece", "body": "In the capital’s retail markets, consumers have been paying between Tk 30 and Tk 40 for a single piece of cauliflower; however, growers are struggling to sell the same produce even at Tk 5-7, leaving many unable to recover their production costs. According to the correspondents from Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, and information from Bagura, cauliflower and cabbage prices plunged sharply at these areas due to intense cold and dense fog. Moreover, excess supply amid limited demand, a lack of storage facilities, insufficient supply, and a shortage of buyers have forced farmers to sell fresh vegetables at throwaway prices, raising concerns about production costs and financial losses. At Lalmonirhat, cauliflower and cabbage were sold at Tk 5-7 per kilogram, with big-sized items usually sold at a kg. Meanwhile, in Kurigram, the prices were little higher, about Tk 10 per kg. Meanwhile, the prices of the items were Tk 30-40 apiece at Karwan Bazar, Kallyanpur Natun Bazar and other retail markets of the capital. The markets at the higher levels were crowded with vegetables across all sections, as farmers from distant areas brought their produce to the market. However, the correspondents said that while the usual presence of buyers and sellers was visible, prices, especially for cauliflower, remained far below expectations. With winter vegetables now in peak season, farmers are facing losses as prices continue to fall daily. Taherul Islam, a trader from Mahathan of Bagura, said that said around 40 large and small commission houses operate at the market, with nearly 40 truckloads of vegetables delivered daily. Farmers told the correspondent that their production costs ranged between Tk 5 and Tk 7 per kilogram, due to high prices of fertiliser, seeds and pesticides. However, prices of all winter vegetables have been falling steadily over the past two weeks, forcing farmers to sell their produce at prices that fail to cover even basic production expenses. As a result, farmers are unable to recover cultivation, labour and transportation costs, leaving many of them financially distressed and at risk of losing their capital. A month ago, cauliflower was selling at Tk 2,000 to Tk 2,500 per maund. “For the past three days, prices have dropped drastically to Tk 80–100 per maund.

{"title": "New Age | Mustard cultivation exceeds target in Dinajpur, expecting bumper yield", "body": "Mustard cultivation in the district has exceeded the target set by the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) this season, raising hopes for a bumper harvest and increased edible oil production. According to Dinajpur DAE deputy director Md. Afzal Hossain, the cultivation target for mustard in the current season was fixed on 27,097 hectares of land. However, farmers brought 29,089 hectares of land under mustard cultivation, exceeding the target by 2,000 hectares. The cultivated area is also 1,992 hectares higher than last year. He said that after harvesting and processing, the district is expected to produce around 48,575 metric tons of mustard, which could yield approximately 17 million litres of healthy mustard oil. Farmers in Karnai and Nashipur villages under Sadar upazila reported cultivating mustard as an additional crop on fallow land between Aman harvest and Boro planting. They expect to harvest mustard within a few days and then resume Boro paddy cultivation on the same land. Farmers said the total cost of mustard cultivation per bigha is between Taka 10,000 and Taka 12,000. Due to favourable weather conditions, yields are expected to be good, averaging 8–9 maunds per bigha. At current market prices, farmers anticipate earnings of around Taka 15,000 per bigha, allowing them to meet household edible oil needs while earning extra income. Deputy director (Research and Training) Md. Mostafizur Rahman said the initiative aimed to reduce dependence on imported edible oil while improving farmers’ income. Under a government programme, 2 kg of high-yielding mustard seeds and 20 kg of chemical fertilizers were distributed free of cost among 2,572 farmers across 13 upazilas in the district, which significantly contributed to exceeding the cultivation target, he said. Sunil Roy, manager of Purbali Oil Mill at Maharaja More in Dinajpur town, said that about 16 litres of oil can be extracted from 40 kg of mustard, meaning one metric ton can produce nearly 400 litres of oil. Local farmers and agriculture officials noted that proper guidance and timely support from the agriculture department have led to a steady increase in mustard cultivation each year, strengthening local edible oil production and boosting farm incomes.

{"title": "New Age | From backbone to steady decline; Bangladesh’s jute exports plunge", "body": "Once hailed as the golden fiber and the backbone of Bangladesh’s post-independence economy, jute now contributes less than 2% to the country’s total export earnings, a sharp fall from nearly 90% in the 1970s. Despite its vast potential, Bangladesh’s jute sector continues to struggle under poor planning, outdated technology and a lack of effective policy support. According to Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) data, export earnings from jute and jute goods have been steadily declining in recent years. The sector earned USD 911.51 million in FY2022–23, dropping to USD 855.23 million in FY2023–24, and further down to USD 820.16 million in FY2024–25, sparking concerns over the future of what was once the country’s flagship export industry. Experts blame the sector’s downturn on years of neglect and inconsistent government decisions. ‘The biggest problem with jute is the absence of any sustained, effective initiative,’ said agronomist and University of Western Australia PhD researcher Dr Moinul Hasan Khan. ‘Over the decades, we’ve seen one jute mill after another shutdown. Farmers never received fair prices for raw jute, and failure to protect both mills and growers has steadily eroded our export income.’ In 2018, the Awami League government revamped the National Jute Policy to revive the sector and enhance its global competitiveness. Yet, only two years later, the same government shut 26 state-owned jute mills down, rendering around 25,000 workers jobless overnight. ‘How can a country dreaming of export growth through jute shut down all its state-owned mills? It’s one of the most self-contradictory policy decisions imaginable,’ said Dr Khan. Data from the Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC) show that between 1972 and 1981, the number of state-owned jute mills increased to 82. The sector, however, soon began to crumble under financial losses, mismanagement and outdated machinery. ‘Working in a jute mill once meant stability and pride,’ recalled Nurul Akand, former Supply Manager of the iconic Adamjee Jute Mills. ‘Mill workers used to earn more than employees in other factories, with better bonuses and allowances. But one by one, those benefits disappeared.’ He said although the government later leased out closed mills to private operators, production never returned to its former levels. Habib Hossain, a former officer at Monowar Jute Mills, said most public mills relied on outdated, Pakistan-era machinery. ‘No training was provided to workers to produce modern jute products. Eventually, citing losses, the government decided to close the factories instead of modernizing them.’ Currently, Bangladesh has over 200 private jute mills, which account for nearly all jute exports. However, private mill owners say they too are facing mounting challenges. ‘The biggest challenge now is sourcing enough raw jute during the season,’ said Tapas Pramanik, Chairman of the Bangladesh Jute Spinners Association (BJSA). ‘Because of hoarders, mills often can’t get adequate raw jute, which stalls production.’ In southern Bangladesh, particularly Faridpur district, the country’s largest jute-producing region, the area under jute cultivation reached 86,500 hectares this year, producing raw jute worth about Tk 2,000 crore, according to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). Yet farmers say they have reaped little benefit. Many had to sell their crops early at low prices, while hoarders later resold the same jute to mills at nearly double the rate. ‘We borrow money for seeds, fertilizers, and labor. When loans fall due, we’re forced to sell quickly, often at minimal profit,’ said Hamiduzzaman, a farmer from Salta upazila in Faridpur. The situation is similar in the northern districts. Farmers in Gaibandha, known for high-quality jute, said they sold raw jute at Tk 2,500–2,800 per maund during harvest season, while current market prices have soared to Tk 4,500–5,000 per maund. ‘Now jute prices are high, but we have none left. Hoarders control the market and profit from our losses,’ said Runu Mia, a farmer from Gaibandha. Mill owners and traders alike point to hoarding and unregulated raw jute exports as the sector’s biggest threats. ‘Hoarders are exporting raw jute abroad, depriving local mills of the raw material they need,’ said Shamsul Haque Howlader, a jute trader from Nalchity upazila in Jhalakathi. ‘The foreign exchange earned from raw jute exports is only a fraction of what we could earn by exporting value-added jute goods.’ Business leaders warn that if hoarding and unregulated raw jute exports are not curbed soon, Bangladesh’s jute industry could face an even deeper crisis. Both farmers and mill owners are urging the government to prioritize technological modernisation, research, and incentives for the sector. They argue that lack of proper retting (soaking) facilities and limited access to processing technology continue to hurt both productivity and quality. Farmers say they still rely on primitive methods, burning wood and straw to ret jute due to water shortages, while mill owners struggle with inefficient production systems. To revive the sector’s lost glory, industry insiders have called for increased subsidies, tax relief and technological upgradation programs for both farmers and mills. Talking about revitalising the jute industry, Jute and Textile Adviser Sk Bashir Uddin said the government wants to move forward by learning from past mistakes in the sector. ‘Many unrealistic and colourful dreams were promoted about the jute industry without considering ground realities, which prevented solutions from addressing the root problems. In the past, inefficiency, incompetence, vested interests and mismanagement pushed the jute industry towards destruction,’ he said. Noting that plastic has gradually replaced jute in many areas, the adviser stressed the need for expanding the market for jute products. ‘To popularise jute bags, a revolving fund has been created under the climate fund involving more than 1,600 entrepreneurs.’ Regarding the closed jute mills, the adviser said the government is in the process of gradually reviving the factories through privatisation. He also mentioned that the government is considering a long-term plan for the jute industry. As Bangladesh pushes towards export diversification, analysts say reviving the jute sector, once the pride of the nation, could provide a sustainable and eco-friendly path to industrial growth, but only if the government takes consistent, forward-looking action.

{"title": "New Age | Bogura potato farmers concerned over market uncertainty", "body": "Despite failing to secure desired prices last season, farmers in the district have cultivated potatoes on a large scale during the current season, hoping for better yields and fair market prices. After completing planting activities in November and December, farmers are now busy with irrigation, fertilization, and weeding and soil management in the fields. The potato fields across Bogura, widely known as a major agricultural hub, are covered with fresh green plants, creating optimism among farmers. However, rising production costs have increased concerns, prompting growers to demand government intervention to ensure fair prices through direct procurement. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), the potato cultivation target for the district this season has been set on 55,750 hectares of land, around 5,000 hectares more than last year. Potato harvesting usually begins in January and continues until the first week of March. Nearly 30 varieties of potatoes are being cultivated in the district, including Pakri, Asterix, Cardinal, Diamond and Granola. Production costs range between Taka 35,000 and Taka 42,000 per bigha, while yields vary from 60 to 120 maunds per bigha, depending on the variety. Large-scale potato cultivation is going on in almost all upazilas of the district, notably Shibganj, Nandigram and Shajahanpur. Meanwhile, early varieties of potatoes have already reached local markets and are selling at prices between Taka 30 and Taka 40 per kilogram. Farmers expressed concern over market uncertainty. Abdul Karim, a farmer from Shibganj upazila, said that prices were disappointing last year, while the cost of seeds, fertilizers and labor has risen sharply this season. ‘Even if production is good, we will suffer losses without a fair price. Government purchase of potatoes would benefit us,’ he said. Rafiqul Islam, a farmer from Nandigram, said that more than Taka 40,000 has been spent per bigha this season. ‘Without a reasonable market price, it is difficult to recover the cost. Direct government procurement would protect us from middlemen,’ he added. Echoing similar concerns, Mostafizur Rahman of Shajahanpur upazila said that although farmers are hopeful for a good yield, there is always fear of a price drop during bumper production. ‘A government purchasing system is essential to ensure fair prices,’ he said. Deputy director of the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE), Bogura, agriculturist Sohel Mohammad Shamsuddin Firoz said farmers are being advised on cultivating improved and export-quality potato varieties. ‘Along with disease and pest control, the department is also working on increasing production and improving market management,’ he added. He further said Bogura produces around 12 lakh metric tons of potatoes annually, meeting local demand and supplying potatoes to various parts of the country, including the capital.

{"title": "New Age | Bumper harvest, plunging prices put Chandpur’s potato market in crisis", "body": "Rows of unsold potato sacks in Chandpur’s cold storages reflect a season of deepening losses, turning what was once a lucrative crop into a source of financial despair for thousands of farmers. In local markets, old potatoes are fetching as little as Tk 7-8 per kilogram, well below production and storage costs, leaving farmers with little incentive to withdraw their stored produce, locals said. Outstanding dues for seed potatoes purchased on credit last season remain unpaid, while storage fees continue to accumulate, they said. Agriculture officials said the district’s 56,860 potato farmers are concentrated mainly in Chandpur Sadar, Matlab South, and Kachua upazilas, where some 5,000 hectares are under potato cultivation. Despite the market downturn, they said, planting continues, though many farmers have scaled back their operations in response to last season’s losses. ‘The absence of syndicates this season has kept potato prices low,’ said Mobarak Hossain, officer at the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE). ‘Last season, syndicates pushed prices up to Tk 80 per kilogram. That situation does not exist this year,’ he said. The ripple effect is felt throughout the supply chain. Cold storage operators in Kachua upazila are struggling as farmers hesitate to withdraw their produce. Mangal Khan and Yasin Mia, managers of local facilities, said that with market prices so low, even selling the stored potatoes fails to cover storage costs. A bumper harvest last season exacerbated the problem. Good-quality old potatoes now sell for Tk 8-10 per kg, while new potatoes are priced around Tk 20 per kg. Farmers who invested heavily are counting losses. ‘I produced 100 maunds of potatoes and made no profit at all-everything turned into a loss,’ said Bachchu Miji, a grower and trader at Bakila Bazar in Hajiganj upazila. Others, including farmers from Shah Mahmudpur in Chandpur Sadar, echoed his frustration. Hanif Patwary, whose 33 sacks of potatoes stored at Baborhat BSCIC cold storage sold for just Tk 3,000 per 50 kg sack, said, ‘After suffering such losses, I will not cultivate potatoes again.’ The situation is mirrored in Kachua upazila, where more than half of stored potatoes remain in cold storage past the usual withdrawal period of November-December, frustrating both farmers and storage operators. Meanwhile, the prices of other vegetables have also softened. Beans, snake beans, bitter gourd, and carrots now sell at Tk 60 per kg, and tomatoes at Tk 40 per kg, down from Tk 90-120 per kg just two weeks ago. Despite the downturn, potato planting continues in Chandpur Sadar, Haimchar, Kachua, and Matlab upazilas, with some farmers reducing cultivation areas due to past losses. Shamsul Islam of Bagadi and Ismail Hossain and Suruj Mia of Dhanpardi said they planted on smaller plots, wary of another season of poor returns. New potatoes arriving from Munshiganj have further driven prices down, falling sharply from Tk 70 to Tk 20 per kg, boosting consumer demand. Currently, 5 kg of new potatoes sell for Tk 100, while 10 kg of old potatoes go for Tk 50-60. Chandpur’s 10 operational cold storages are holding 80,169 tonnes of potatoes against a maximum capacity of 80,250 tonnes, according to Mobarak Hossain. Abu Taher, deputy director of DAE Chandpur, said the cultivation target for the current season has been set at 7,200 hectares, down 1,000 hectares from last year, citing farmers’ discouragement and mounting debts. ‘Farmers are naturally drawn to crops that guarantee fair prices. While about 4,000 hectares are already under potatoes, the focus is shifting to crops that ensure financial returns,’ he said. For Chandpur’s potato farmers and storage operators, the coming months will be critical, as the market continues to weigh on livelihoods and investment decisions, according to the officials.

{"title": "New Age | Good prices encourage Rangpur farmers to expand banana cultivation", "body": "Stable profitable prices since the outbreak of the Covid-19 epidemic in 2019, farmers have been encouraged to expand banana cultivation in all five districts of Rangpur agricultural region. In the last six years, hundreds of farmers have changed their fortunes by cultivating bananas, making huge profits as the price of bananas has not dropped even once. As a result, the Department of Agricultural Extension officials, experts, and farmers are considering banana cultivation as a highly profitable venture in the mainland and riverine char areas to meet nutritional needs as well as achieve self-reliance. According to DAE officials, after achieving bumper production and profitable prices in the last six years, farmers are expanding banana cultivation in Rangpur, Gaibandha, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat and Nilphamari districts of the region every year. ‘Farmers have already cultivated bananas on 2,621 hectares of land during the current 2025-2026 Rabi season till last week in the region,’ additional director (in-charge) of the DAE for Rangpur region agriculturist Md Shirajul Islam said. Transplantation of banana saplings will continue till this month-end in the region. ‘During the last 2024-2025 Rabi season, farmers cultivated bananas on 2,683 hectares of land in the region,’ Shirajul said. Following massive motivational activities conducted by the DAE, farmers are expanding cultivation of bananas as a cash crop to reap more profits alongside meeting their own nutrition to strengthen body immunity. The DAE officials are assisting farmers and providing technical support to them in expanding cultivation of ‘Meher Sagar’, ‘Malbhog’, ‘Sobri’ and other varieties of banana on more lands both in mainland and char areas. Meanwhile, harvesting of early varieties of bananas has already begun with a bumper yield and lucrative market price bringing huge profits to farmers making them happy. Talking to BSS, farmers Abdur Rahman, Mokhlesur Rahman and Badal Hossain of different villages in Badarganj upazila of Rangpur said that they had been cultivating bananas for the last 15 years and earning rewarding profits every year. Farmers Mofizar Rahman, Abdul Hye and Nurun Nabi of village Dolapara in Taraganj upazila and Habibur Rahman of village Gopalpur in Badarganj upazila of Rangpur said that they had cultivated bananas on more land areas this time than last season. Farmers Yusuf Ali, Babul Akhter, Nurul Islam and Mahbubar of different char villages in Nageshwari upazila of Kurigram said that char people had been successfully cultivating bananas on char lands and reaping lucrative profits for the last ten years. ‘We are selling bananas on one side of char lands and cultivating it afresh on the other side on vacant lands round the year. The process of formation and growth of new banana bunches continues all the time giving the gardens fresh looks,’ said Yusuf Ali. Babul Akhter said that more and more char lands were being brought under banana farming in Nageshwari upazila like in other upazilas of Kurigram every year. ‘We are cultivating bananas afresh round the year with other crops adopting intercropping and relay methods on char lands. Banana farming is largely contributing to our socio-economic development,’ he said. Retail fruit traders Fazlur Rahman at Rangpur City Bazar and Abdus Samad at Pirgachha Bazar in Rangpur said they are selling every four pieces of ‘Malbhog’ and ‘Sobri’ varieties of bananas at rates between Tk 35 and Tk 50 now. Deputy director of the DAE’s Burirhat Horticulture Centre in Rangpur Dr Md Abu Sayem said that banana cultivation was expanding in both mainland and char areas, improving farmers’ livelihoods and keeping the rural economy vibrant.

{"title": "New Age | How the EU and Mercosur agro-powerhouse Brazil differ on pesticides", "body": "The EU-Mercosur free trade agreement, set to be signed on Saturday, reignites debate over pesticides banned for European farmers but widely used in Latin America -- a major export market for EU agrochemical companies. AFP compared Brussels rules with those in Brazil to illustrate the differences in pesticide standards between the two blocs, which traded more than €15 billion worth of agricultural goods in 2024. Brazil accounts for 80 per cent of the EU’s trade with Mercosur countries (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay). As of late November, it had authorised the use of 330 active substances. Sixty per cent of them had not been approved in the EU, 37 per cent had been approved, and 3 per cent were under review, according to data cross-checked between the Brazilian health regulatory agency (Anvisa) and the European Commission. Conversely, of the 421 active substances approved in the EU, 73 percent had not been greenlighted in Brazil. However, these figures come with caveats. EU member states can temporarily allow national use of substances banned at the European level. In France, for instance, the herbicide flufenacet -- classified as an endocrine disruptor and withdrawn from the EU market in December -- has been granted a grace period allowing one more year of use. A country may also ban a substance authorised by Brussels if it deems the environmental or health risks are too high. Acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid highly toxic to bees, is currently banned in France but allowed elsewhere in the EU. Although imports from Mercosur must legally meet EU standards, European farmers argue that controls are too weak to prevent unfair competition. Critics of the EU-Mercosur deal point in particular to the EU’s tolerance of pesticide residues below defined safety limits, even though the substances themselves are banned in the EU. In response, the European Commission pledged in early January to completely ban imports containing residues of three fungicides: carbendazim, benomyl and thiophanate-methyl. The first two are already banned in Brazil, but thiophanate-methyl -- withdrawn from the EU market in 2021 over health concerns -- remains authorised in the Latin American state. Some countries have gone a step further. France has suspended imports of products containing residues of mancozeb and glufosinate, in addition to the three fungicides targeted by Brussels. Mancozeb, used on avocados, mangoes and peppers, is classified as an endocrine disruptor by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), and is suspected of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, according to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). Glufosinate ammonium, an herbicide widely used on potatoes, is also classified for presumed human reproductive toxicity. Banned in the EU, these substances rank among the best-selling in Brazil: mancozeb is the second most marketed active ingredient, glufosinate the sixth. European chemicals companies have historically manufactured such pesticides and shipped them to Mercosur countries. In 2024, groups like BASF, Corteva, Syngenta and Bayer exported 18,000 tonnes of pesticides prohibited for use within the EU, according to data compiled by Swiss NGO Public Eye and Greenpeace UK’s investigation unit Unearthed, drawing from the ECHA and national authorities. More than 80 per cent of these exports went to Brazil, the world’s second-largest market for these EU-made pesticides after the United States. Leading the list was picoxystrobin, a fungicide used on cereals and soybeans, banned in the EU since 2017 over genotoxic and environmental risks. Soybeans -- of which Brazil is the world’s top exporter -- reach the EU mainly as soybean meal to feed livestock. In 2024-25, Europe imported over 20 million tonnes of Brazilian soybean meal. Regarding the substances targeted by Brussels and Paris last week, European companies filed export notifications for 2,300 tonnes of glufosinate, 260 tonnes of thiophanate-methyl and 250 tonnes of mancozeb to Mercosur in 2024, according to figures published in September 2025. Several environmental NGOs hit out at the EU for what they called a “double-standard policy” that bans certain pesticides in Europe while exporting them abroad.

{"title": "New Age | Tomato cultivation emerges as economic force in Rajshahi", "body": "Tomato cultivation has emerged as a significant economic force in Rajshahi, contributing an estimated Tk 100 crore in yearly trade. Many of the farmers of Godagari, Tanore and Paba upazilas are spending a busy time harvesting tomatoes from their fields. During the current winter season, tomatoes are being grown on around 3,500 hectares of land across the district. Wholesale prices are presently hovering between Tk 1,800 and Tk 2,000 per maund, while early-harvest tomatoes have secured even higher prices. At the beginning of the season, many traders purchase produce directly from farmers’ fields, providing growers with immediate and consistent cash returns. Officials from the Department of Agricultural Extension said that tomatoes produced in Rajshahi were largely free from chemical ripening agents, which had strengthened consumer trust and increased demand in major urban markets. After mango, tomatoes have now become the district’s second most important cash crop, directly engaging more than one lakh families in farming and trading. In addition, thousands of others earn livelihoods through transportation, storage, and marketing linked to the tomato supply chain. Farmers said tomato is more profitable than most other field crops, with production ranging from 60 to 70 maunds per bigha. Ijarul Haque, a farmer of Premtali village in Godagari, said that he cultivated tomatoes on five bighas of land. He harvested 10 maunds in the first phase and sold them at Tk 2,300 per maund, adding that production will increase further in the coming days. Another farmer, Amzad Hossain, said that good prices were available at the beginning of the season and traders often purchased tomatoes from entire fields in advance. He said that traders from outside districts regularly visited the area to buy tomatoes while local traders also participate. Tozammel Haque of Sultanganj village said that he cultivated two hybrid varieties on one and a half bighas of land, spending Tk 1.25 lakh. Over the last two weeks, he sold tomatoes worth Tk 30,000 at rates of Tk 70-75 per kilogram. ‘Platform-cultivated tomatoes have high demand as they ripen naturally on the plants without the need for chemicals,’ he added. Saiful Islam, 47, of Pirijpur village said that he cultivated high-yielding varieties that were fetching good prices in the markets. He said that tomatoes were currently selling at Tk 1,800 to Tk 2,000 per maund on wholesale markets. Ekramul Haque of Bijoynagar village said that many farmers in the region had already changed their fortunes through tomato cultivation, earning between Tk 25,000 and Tk 35,000 per bigha in a season. ‘Tomato farming is gaining popularity in the region, especially in the vast Barind tract, as it is highly profitable here,’ said Dr Azizur Rahman, additional director of Department of Agricultural Extension. He said that tomatoes, now considered the second major cash crop of the region, played an important role in the local economy. More than one lakh families are directly benefiting from tomato cultivation and trading, while a large number of employment opportunities are generated every year. Retired chief scientific officer of the Fruit Research Station, Dr Alim Uddin, said that the soil and climatic conditions of Rajshahi, Natore, Naogaon and Chapainawabganj districts were highly suitable for tomato cultivation.

{"title": "New Age | RMG manufacturers want separate ministry", "body": "The manufacturers of the country’s readymade garment sector demanded a separate ministry for sustainable RMG and textile sector. They also said that the RMG sector is a major source of export earnings as a single sector, but it has to face new challenges from global and local perspectives. To address these challenges, it requires a long-term policy, for which a separate ministry is necessary. They were speaking at an Iftar event organized by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association’s election-centric panel, Forum, in the capital on Saturday. Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu, forum panel leader and managing director of Rising Group, said that the garment sector needs policy support for a certain period of time. ‘Domestic and foreign conspiracies are always going against this sector and a vested interest group is creating anarchy in the name of worker’s unrest at different times. It should be investigated whether politics is involved behind this,’ he added. He also said that the entrepreneurs of this sector should be freed from customs inspections and harassment. Rashid Ahmed Hossaini, secretary general of the Forum, said that they have learned about the identification of 700 fake voters through media outlets. ‘Their voting rights have been canceled. This is very shameful that this sector has fake voters. We want the next election to be transparent and acceptable. We should remember that the economy cannot be sustained in Bangladesh without this sector. And BGMEA cannot be turned into a party office of any particular political party,’ he added. Former BGMEA President Anisur Rahman Sinha said that the government may have less knowledge about business, and it is the responsibility of businesses to assist the government. ‘BGMEA, as an organization, has to take a role in highlighting and resolving any problems being created. Another former president, Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury (Parvez), said that BGMEA needs skilled leadership to deal with the crisis. Rubana Huq, another former BGMEA president, said that the manufacturers want relief from many years of garbage. A transparent vote to restore the balance is necessary. Moreover, a factory can become sick for reasons beyond its control, but there is no exit policy. ‘We urge the government to formulate a detailed exit policy. Moreover, the manufacturers should increase their bargaining with foreign buyers for fair prices,’ she added. Meanwhile, the BGMEA election for the 2025-27 tenure is scheduled for May 28, according to the election schedule announced on Saturday.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to major destinations increase", "body": "The exports of the country’s readymade garment items witnessed substantial growth to its major destinations in the past eight months (July-February) of the current financial year 2024-25. According to the country-wise detailed export data of the Export Promotion Bureau and compiled by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $26.8 billion in July-February of FY25, a moderate increase of 10.64 per cent, from $24.22 billion in the same period of FY24. Apparel exporters said that, thanks to the growing demands of brands and retailers, export earnings maintained a growth momentum despite the political transition since August 5. In the July-February period of FY25, Bangladesh bagged $13.42 billion from the European Union countries, the largest market of Bangladeshi manufacturers. This is 11.53 percent higher than the $12.03 billion earned in the same period of FY25. The export earnings from the EU accounted for 50.10 per cent of the total earnings. Export earnings from the US witnessed a robust growth of 16.38 percent to $5.07 billion, up from $4.35 billion in the July-February period of FY24. The US, the largest single destination for exporters, represented an 18.91 per cent share of the total earnings. Fetching a positive growth of 3.74 per cent, Bangladeshi apparel exporters earned $2.92 billion in July-February of FY25 from the UK, higher from $2.82 billion in the same period of FY24, the EPB data stated. From Canada, the RMG sector earned $845.55 million in July-February of FY25, 14.12 per cent more than the $740.91 million earned in the same period of FY24. Germany remained the largest export destination within the EU countries, from where Bangladeshi RMG manufacturers bagged $3.38 billion in July-February of FY25. Followed by Germany, the export earnings from Spain stood at $2.35 billion, France at $1.43 billion, Italy at $1.05 billion, Poland at $1.13 billion, and the Netherlands at $1.43 billion, the EPB data stated. Regarding apparel exports, countries like the US, Canada, the UK, and the EU are considered traditional markets, while other countries are deemed non-traditional. Japan, Australia, Russia, India, China, South Korea, UAE, Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico are major non-traditional export destinations. Export earnings from the nontraditional market also demonstrated positive growth, with an overall surge of 6.23 percent reaching $4.52 billion, which was $4.26 billion in the FY24 period. The nontraditional market represented 16.90 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports.

Moreover, RMG exports to Turkey and Mexico also witnessed significant earnings, amounting to $305 million and $229 million, respectively. EPB data showed that export earnings from almost all major destinations experienced a double-digit growth rate during the July-February period. Talking to New Age, Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the BGMEA, said that Bangladesh’s ongoing growth in exports significantly depends on the EU and USA, which continue to be its main markets. The moderate growth in the non-traditional market underscores the importance of further research and focus in this category, as it possesses substantial growth potential, which will also help to balance reliance on traditional markets, he added. He also said there should be a dedicated emphasis on investing in backward linkages to bolster and enhance the RMG sector’s competitiveness and growth potential, as remaining competitive throughout is always essential.

However, the sector’s manufacturers said that they were intensively monitoring the risky factories and would take sufficient measures if necessary. The sector people said that the wage situation was complex this year as the manufacturers must pay February wages, Eid bonuses and half of March wages by Ramadan 20 or March 19. Moreover, they also have to pay the rest of the March wages by April 7, just after the factories reopen after the Eid holidays. Talking to New Age, Hashibul Alam, additional DIG (operation and crime) of the Industrial Police, said that they had completed a primary list of the risky factories ahead of Eid. ‘However, the number of the factories may vary in the final list. So far, about 200 factories are at risk of not paying wages and bonuses in time to their workers at major eight industrial hubs and export processing zones,’ he added. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Labour and Employment has instructed the factory authorities to pay all outstanding wages, bonuses and dues to workers by Ramadan 20 in a tripartite consultative council meeting held on March 12. Based on their financial capacity, they also urged the entrepreneurs to pay at least 15 days’ wages for March. According to the Industrial Police data, among the risky factories, 128 are members of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, 16 are affiliated with the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association and four are listed with the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association. Moreover, nine units are under the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority while the rest are not listed with any. As of Sunday, of the 2,107 active factories across the country, only six factories were closed where three were laid-off, two were on general holiday and another one was operational under no work, no pay guideline as per the Bangladesh Labour Act section 13/1 according to data from a BGMEA source. The data also said that as of Sunday, 124 BGMEA factories were yet to pay their February wages and 5 still had not paid January wages. Talking to New Age, Mohammad Hatem, president of the BKMEA, said that businesses were under pressure and they urged the government to clear the debt of Tk 7,000 crore as an export subsidy or cash incentives. ‘Banks are not assisting us. If we get at the money, we will be able to pay the wages,’ he added. He also said that the BKMEA had 16-17 risky members and they were working on monitoring these factories closely. Regarding the ministry’s directive of paying wages by Ramadan 20, he said that it would not be realistic as they always paid wages and allowances before the start of the Eid holidays and they thought that they would also move in the same way. Khairul Mamun Mintu, organising secretary of Garment Workers’ Trade Union Centre, told New Age that the government must take action about risky factories. ‘The government and the manufacturers should work sincerely as the situation is more complex this year. The factory owners must pay February wages, half of March and bonus by this month and the rest of March by April 7,’ he added.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh's apparel exports to EU rise by 61pc in Jan", "body": "Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the European Union have recorded significant growth in the beginning of 2025, rising by 60.9 per cent to 1.91 billion euros in January, compared with 1.19 billion euros in the same month of 2024. In terms of quantity, the country’s readymade garment exports to the EU also witnessed a substantial surge in the first month of 2025 increasing by 58.10 per cent to 126.86 million kilogram from 80.25 million kilogram in the same month of previous year, according to data from the Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, released on Tuesday. The country’s knitwear exports to the 27-nation economic bloc in the first month of 2025 surged by 64.2 per cent to 1.15 billion euros, while woven apparel exports increased by 56.3 per cent to 765.97 million euros, data showed. Exporters said that this substantial growth solidified Bangladesh’s position as a key supplier to the European market, driven by competitive pricing, preferential trade facilities under Everything But Arms and improvements in production capacity. They also said that overall apparel imports by the EU rose significantly in January 2025, as consumer demand for clothing increased with declining inflation and falling interest rates. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association former president Fazlul Hoque described the growth as ‘encouraging,’ saying that the industry was rebounding. He said that, similar to the US market, the EU market was also improving after a prolonged period of weakness. Fazlul Hoque explained that with the economy improving, consumers were purchasing more apparel, leading to increased demand in the EU market. Data showed that the overall apparel imports by the EU from different countries in January 2025 witnessed a significant surge in January 2025, with total imports reaching 8.29 billion euros, up 31.9 per cent from 6.28 billion euros in January 2024. China, the largest apparel supplier to the EU, maintained strong growth, with total exports increasing by 40.9 per cent to 2.38 billion euros in January 2025. The country’s knitwear exports to the EU grew by 45.3 per cent to 1.23 billion euros, while woven exports rose by 36.4 per cent to 1.14 billion euros. Bangladesh remained the second-largest apparel exporter to the EU after China. The EU’s apparel imports from Turkey in January 2025 increased by 5.4 per cent to 874.09 million euros from 829.21 million euros in the same month of 2024. Cambodia’s apparel exports to the EU in January 2025 surged by 72.5 per cent—the highest among major exporting countries—reaching 420.9 million euros. Knitwear exports rose by 71.6 per cent to 256.2 million euros, while woven apparel jumped by 73.9 per cent to 164.7 million euros. The EU’s apparel imports from India increased by 44.5 per cent year-on-year, reaching 397.7 million euros in January 2025. Vietnam’s apparel exports to the EU in January 2025 climbed by 34.3 per cent to 398.6 million euros, with knitwear rising by 26 per cent and woven apparel increasing by 40.7 per cent. Exporters said that Vietnam’s steady expansion underscores its appeal as a reliable sourcing hub, benefiting from a well-developed supply chain and free trade agreements such as the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement, which offers preferential tariffs on many textile products. Pakistan’s apparel exports to the EU grew by 31.9 per cent, reaching 347.7 million euros in January 2025. In January 2025, the Pakistan’s woven apparel exports to the EU increased by 42.8 per cent to 175.6 million euros, while knitwear grew by 22.5 per cent to 172.1 million euros.

{"title": "New Age | RMG stakeholders see no complexity in payment before Eid", "body": "The stakeholders of the country’s readymade garment sector said that the payment of wages and allowances in the sector would be cleared ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr. According to the Industrial Police and the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, most factories have already paid the wages for February and are now disbursing the wages for the 15 days of March. They also said that a major portion of the RMG factories have already paid the Eid bonuses, and the rest will soon. All the payments will be cleared before the starting of the Eid holidays. So far, 2,069 factory units among 2,107 operational factory units have provided the February wages. Moreover, about 30 factories have already cleared 15 days or a full month’s wages for March, and more than half of the total RMG factory units have already paid the Eid bonuses. Industrial Police, manufacturers, and labour leaders expressed their optimism that the situation of wages, bonuses, and Eid transport would be much better than the past year’s situation. Talking to New Age, Hashibul Alam, additional DIG (operation and crime) of the Industrial Police, said several factories have started disbursing wages and festival allowances ahead of Eid. ‘Usually, the factory authorities disburse wages and bonuses on different dates. As example, a factory authority may provide the wages on March 25, and bonuses on March 29, at the last working day before starting Eid holiday,’ he added. He also said that they could not see any tension regarding the disbursement of the payments ahead of Eid, and he is rather optimistic that the workers would be paid in time. However, the sector witnessed unrest in the Bhogra bypass area of Gazipur on Saturday, which led to the closure of around 30 RMG factory units. According to New Age’s Gazipur correspondent, the workers of a number of RMG factories took to the streets in various demands including wages, allowances and eid holidays. Sources said that Giant Knit Fashion Ltd was declared closed under 13/1 of the Bangladesh Labour Act due to the workers› protests. After that, the authorities of around 30 factories declared general holidays in fear of vandalism and arson attacks. Talking to New Age, AKM Johirul Islam, superintendent of police of Industrial Police-2 (Gazipur), said that issues between the workers and management of Giant Knit Fashion led the authority to close the factory. In this regard, the authorities of other garments also declared their factory units closed. ‘However, it was for a time being. After returning of normalcy, the authorities of the maximum factories called their workers to join work,’ he added. Regarding the wages and allowances of the factories in the Gazipur hub, he said that the factories are gradually clearing the wages and bonuses for the workers. ‘March 27 is Thursday, and we hope by this date, most of the factories will be able to pay their wages and bonuses. We don’t see any tensions regarding this,’ he added. The law enforcement agency also stated they are closely monitoring the risky factories. Chattogram correspondent of New Age said that the workers of JMS Garments Limited staged a protest in Chattogram EPZ area on Saturday morning, blocking roads to demand their unpaid salaries. The demonstration caused severe traffic congestion in the area. The protest began around 9:00am, with workers gathering in the EPZ road area. By 1:30pm, police intervened and dispersed them from the road. Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel told New Age that a number of factories couldn’t clear their payments due to weekends in the banks. ‘However, we hope by March 25, the festival allowances of the most factories will be cleared, and, before starting the Eid holidays, the half wage of March and other allowances will also be paid,’ he added. Talking to New Age, Babul Akhter, president of the Bangladesh Garment and Industrial Workers Federation, said that the situation in the sector is much better than it appeared from the outside. ‘Most of the RMG factories have already paid their bonuses and will pay the half wages of March soon,’ he added, saying that the situation seems complex due to three significant facts. These are the pending wage issues of closed factories like Beximco, the payment of a full wage, Eid bonuses, and a half wage in the same month, and the last one is the frequent protests of the workers, even in ridiculous issues. ‘However, we hope that everything will be cleared before the Eid holidays start. Due to Friday and Saturday, the disbursement of bonuses witnessed a sluggishness, which will be solved on Sunday next,’ he said. The Eid-ul-Fitr may be celebrated on March 31 or April 1 based on sighting the moon.

{"title": "New Age | More than 80pc RMG units pay Eid bonuses", "body": "Workers stage protests demanding dues About 83.67 per cent readymade garment factories cleared payment of bonuses ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr, one of the largest religious festivals of Muslims to be held at the end of March subject to moon-sighting, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. According to the data, the BGMEA said that 1,543 RMG factories from the Dhaka zone and 220 from the Chattogram zone, totaling 1,763 factories, had cleared the payment of bonuses as of Monday. Moreover, 2,076 factories or 98.53 per cent of total operational RMG factories under the BGMEA cleared the payment of wages for the month of February, where 1,747 are from Dhaka zone and 329 from Chattogram zone. However, according to the BGMEA data, 84 factories from both zones have cleared half or full wages for March. Stakeholders said that by the end of this week or just before starting the Eid holidays, most of the factories would clear the wages for March. According to the data from Industrial Police, there are 245 risky factories that may not pay wages, bonuses and allowances ahead of Eid. Among them, 33 factories are at high risk. Meanwhile, several incidents of unrest occurred in some factories in the different industrial hubs on Monday. According to BGMEA officials, about 250 workers of Mymensingh-based Roar Fashion Limited blocked the BGMEA complex in the capital’s Uttara area since Monday morning, demanding their dues. They also halted the regular movement of the BGMEA officials, which hindered their daily activities. The factory is located at Bhaluka of Mymensingh and has a registration number of 6367. It employs about 1,200 workers. According to the BGMEA, the workers were owed approximately three months’ wages and service benefits. Roar Fashion managing director Mamunul Islam could not be contacted to get a statement regarding the matter. On the other hand, workers at Fame Design Limited in Narayanganj attacked at least four officers at Fame Apparel, two of whom were severely injured and admitted to a local hospital, according to Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. He said that they attacked the factory officials when the workers failed to halt production. Later, they blocked the road at Ponchoboti intersection and the army arrested seven agitated workers involved in the attack on Fame Apparel workers, he added. Fame Design managing director Masud Alam Kajol said that workers are demanding 10 days’ vacation, similar to government officials. However, this does not apply to them. The workers have been protesting and halting production since Sunday. Moreover, the workers of JMS Garments in Chattogram Export Processing Zone have once again blocked the busy Airport Road on Monday at the Freeport intersection, demanding unpaid salaries and Eid bonuses. Workers have warned of continuing the blockade until payments are made. The Industrial Police told New Age’s Chattogram correspondent that the factory owners had applied for a bank loan to clear dues but cannot pay on Monday. They assured that salaries and bonuses might be disbursed today. Around 500 workers took to the streets at 11:00am on Monday.

{"title": "New Age | Govt may halt import of yarn thru land ports", "body": "The government has started a move to halt the import of yarn through the country’s land ports as these ports lack the proper testing capacity of the yarns, according to a meeting of the Ministry of Commerce held on Monday. According to sources and two participants in the meeting, the government has taken this move following a request from the country’s textile millers to protect the country’s local industry. Moreover, the facilities for yarn imports through all land ports have reportedly been misused for a long time, said the officials, citing a meeting held by the commerce ministry on Monday. According to Bangladesh Textile Millers, Bangladesh’s cotton yarn imports surged by over 39 per cent in 2024, costing $2.28 billion. Moreover, fabric imports by knitwear factories hiked by 38 per cent, worth of $2.59 billion. The BTMA claimed that the industry has the capacity to supply nearly 100 per cent of the demand for export-oriented knit garments. However, the decision of halting yarn imports through land ports created mixed reactions among the country’s apparel manufacturers and textile millers. The apparel manufacturers expressed concerns that such a decision could significantly impact small and medium-sized readymade garment exporters relying on land ports to import yarn easily. They also warn that this move could disrupt the supply chain, increase production costs, and ultimately affect Bangladesh’s competitiveness in the global apparel market. On the other hand, the textile millers welcomed the decision, as they had long demanded the halt. Recently, the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, the apex trade body of the country’s spinners, requested finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed, through a letter, to halt the yarn import through land ports. In late January, the finance adviser’s office forwarded the letter, signed by BTMA president Showkat Aziz Russell, to the National Board of Revenue for regulatory consideration. Regarding the ban, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association executive president Fazlee Shamim Ehsan told New Age that a complete ban may not be the best approach. Instead, improving monitoring and customs procedures at land ports would be a more effective solution. They urged the government to reconsider the decision and explore alternative measures, such as strengthening customs inspection processes at land ports. They have also suggested phased implementation or exemptions for smaller factories to mitigate the potential negative impact. Talking to New Age, BKMEA president Mohammad Hatem said that textile millers have huge stocks as they are not competitive in pricing compared with millers in other countries. He also said that the price of 30 single yarn in Bangladesh is $3.40 per kg, while in India, it is $2.90 per kg, and in Vietnam $2.96 per kg. ‘The local textile millers have huge stocks not due to import through land ports, due to the wrong policy of reducing incentives by the previous government,’ he added, saying that if the government refix the incentives, textile millers would not face any issues. He raised question about the volume of yarn imports through land ports and what percentage they constitute of the total imported yarn. He also said that if the government bans yarn imports via land ports, it would negatively impact small and medium-sized factories and fast-fashion apparel manufacturers, as seaports require a longer lead time. The manufacturers also said that the larger factories can source raw materials through seaports or local suppliers, smaller manufacturers often depend on land ports for quicker and more flexible imports. Meanwhile, BTMA President Showkat Aziz Russell said the previous government had revised the policy to allow yarn imports through land ports, but these ports lack the necessary facilities to test the yarns properly. Moreover, the policy permitted partial shipments, which led to widespread misuse, they claimed. “We have seen growth in apparel exports in the new fiscal year, yet local mills are struggling due to multiple challenges, including low orders,” he said. He also said that while Bangladesh’s textile industry is facing difficulties, India’s textile exports to Bangladesh have experienced significant growth, which is contrary to the country’s interests. He said that without an immediate ban on yarn imports through land ports, the country’s textile sector would suffer irreparable losses, leading to higher unemployment. However, yarn and fabrics are entering the local market at dumping prices from India through various land ports, creating new challenges for them. The BTMA demanded the halt of yarn imports through land ports such as Benapole, Bhomra, Sona Masjid, and Banglabandha, as they lack proper infrastructure, yarn count measuring equipment, skilled manpower, and effective oversight. Moreover, they face unfair competition due to the widespread marketing of unauthorized yarn, often imported through land ports with false declarations at customs. The letter suggested halting yarn imports through land ports and shifting to seaports to protect the domestic textile sector and preserve valuable foreign exchange. Currently, yarn imports via seaports take 13 to 15 days but benefit from high-quality scanners, yarn count measuring machines, and better infrastructure. The BTMA has claimed that Indian exporters are selling yarn to Bangladesh at a lower price than in their local market. The trade body has also urged an anti-dumping policy.

{"title": "New Age | Owners face travel ban if RMG workers not paid before Eid", "body": "Labour and employment adviser M Sakhawat Hossain said that the government would impose a travel ban on factory units if they can’t pay wages and festival allowances to the workers by March 27. He also said that the manufacturers won’t be able to go abroad without paying the workers’ wages and festival allowances during the mentioned deadline, and all legal measures would be taken against them. He spoke to the media at a press conference in the secretariat on Tuesday regarding the contemporary labour sector status. He mentioned that they, along with the home ministry, had taken steps against the 12 factories assumed unable to pay the workers before the deadline. ‘The factories must pay the workers, even by selling their properties, cars, or whatever’ he said. He also said that some factory owners lead lavish lives and go abroad to celebrate Eid but cannot pay their workers. ‘I urge the workers to speak up if they have logical demand. However, if anyone raises unreasonable demands, then we will take action against them too,’ he added. He also urged the workers to demonstrate in front of manufacturers’ houses or banks, liable to release the incentive money. ‘There is no result by blocking the ministry as we don’t owe the money to you,’ he added. He also said that the government provided Tk 2,250 crore to the factories as export incentives, and the owners are bound to pay the workers now. ‘If anyone go abroad without paying, they should inform that they cannot run their factories. We will manage the money by selling them,’ he added. The authorities identified some factories which do not pay workers properly. The factories show lame excuse that they have no money to pay the workers before Eid. He added that the government would take action against them. Responding to a question about factories in risk of payment failure, he said that there were 12 risky factories so far and among them, 5 were highly risky. ‘However, these factories have been struggling for the past 2-3 years. They are now trying to pressure the government to take advantage. Why should we pay for them?’ He added that many of these factories were shut 3-4 years ago. Responding to a question, labour secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman said that they screened 250 risky factories and connected them with the central bank. ‘We provide the highest amount of incentive this year for all the factories. However, there are 5-6 factories who had been suffering from various problems for at least 5 years. On the other hand, some workers of several factories took to the street demanding Eid bonuses but they were recruited 2-3 months ago, which is against the Labour Act,’ he added. Regarding Beximco›s latest update, the Labour Adviser said that, as per the decision of the 8th meeting of the Advisory Council Committee on March 24, the management cleared wages worth Tk 295 crore to workers and Tk 162 crore to employees. Only 214 workers and 207 employees have yet to receive their wages, which are worth Tk 60.82 crore. He added that more than Tk 5 crore is expected to be surplus among the Tk 525.46 crore disbursed. He also said that about 99.99 per cent of RMG factories under the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association and Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association have cleared the wages for February. He added that all the RMG factories must pay the full or half wages for March before starting the Eid holidays. Meanwhile, according to the BGMEA, about 90.18 per cent of RMG factories cleared payment of festival allowances ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr. Of them, 1,618 factories are in the Dhaka zone and 282 in the Chattogram zone, totaling 1900. Moreover, 2,083 factories, or 98.86 per cent of the total operational RMG factories under the BGMEA, cleared the February wage. So far, 199 factories have cleared the full or half wages of March. The Eid holidays in the RMG sector will start on March 26, said the BGMEA. Under BKMEA, 99.08 per cent of factories cleared February wages, 53.19 per cent March wages, and 75.87 percent cleared festival allowances, said the BKMEA sources.

{"title": "New Age | WORKERS’ DUE WAGES: 3 TNZ Group officials under custody", "body": "Three representatives of TNZ Group owners have been taken under the custody where they will remain till April 8 when the government will meet all parties involved in the group’s three readymade garment units. Labour and Employment Secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman revealed this when he was speaking to the journalists on Saturday regarding the ongoing payment issues in the labour sector. He said that they partially resolved the problems of TNZ factories on March 27 by paying Tk 1.05 crore to the workers. ‹The owner of the TNZ group moved to Saudi Arabia long ago with many outstanding issues. The government had provided Tk 16 crore to the group to resolute their issues,’ he added. He said that the TNZ Group was instructed to solve the problems with these funds. It has come to light that they currently owe Tk 17.13 crore to about 3,000 workers. Meanwhile, regarding the payment of Tk1.05 crore, Labour adviser M Shakhawat Hossain›s speech created further dissatisfaction among the workers as it was partially true. On Saturday, labour secretary said that this cannot go like this, and they have decided on the TNZ Group. ‘As all banks, even the central banks, have been closed for the Eid holidays, we have nothing to do with proper banking channels,’ he added. In this regard, the government decided to bring three representatives of the TNZ Group under police custody. The three top officials of TNZ are Shariful Islam Shamin, Group Director; Ali Hossain, Executive Director; and Enamul Haque, Group CHO. ‘The company will pay Tk 3 crore to the workers for their Eid transport by selling machinery of the factories,’ he added, saying that they will sit again on April 8 with all parties to decide on paying outstanding dues. ‘Before May Day, we want to ensure a resolution to the TNZ issue,’ he added. On Friday, the workers of three factories said they are owed a staggering Tk 17.78 crore in unpaid wages, Eid bonuses, and other allowances, but they were paid only Tk 1.05 crore on March 27. However, after the meeting, TNZ Apparels cutting operator Shahidul Islam said the workers had rejected the decision and would continue their protests until all their dues were paid. He also said they would continue demonstrating before Sromo Bhaban, even on Eid day. A number of agitating workers blocked the car of the Labour Secretary for a time. However, they withdrew their blockade but continued the sit-on-protest as of writing the report. Labour leader Joly Talukdar said that they demand at least one month’s wages and festival allowances before Eid. However, the labour secretary hasn’t decided how to solve the problems. Iqbalur Rahman, former president of Revolutionary Chatra Moitry, said the group refused the government›s decisions and will continue protests. According to the ministry, about 12 factory units under TNZ Group, Style Craft Group, Mahmud Group, Dird Group, Roar Fashion, Basic, and Ssain Apparels faced issues paying their wages due to not getting loans or because their owners were in hiding. Regarding these problem-prone factories, the Labour Secretary said that on March 27, they resolved the issues of almost all factories, including Style Craft and Mahmud Group. However, Salauddin Swapan, senior vice president of IndustriALL Bangladesh Council, told New Age that the solution of the crisis-prone factories are not permanent, it may again arise after Eid. He also urged the government to take proper measures for the non-member factories as problems regarding payment persist there but no one to take actions. Meanwhile, the Industrial Police said in a statement that almost all the factories under four major trade bodies had cleared wages and allowances. Industrial Police also stated that some factories, including TNZ, Mahmud, or Style Craft, witnessed problems, and the ministry and trade bodies were trying to resolve them. According to the Factory Monitoring of the BGMEA, 99.87 per cent or 2,098 of 2,106 factories cleared the festival allowances, 99.62 per cent or 2,099 factories February wages, and 98.67 per cent or 2,079 factories cleared the half or full wages of March.

{"title": "New Age | RMG sector in Bangladesh faces challenges as US slaps high tariffs", "body": "The country’s readymade garment manufacturers expressed concern over the US’s fresh 37 per cent tariff imposition on all Bangladeshi exporting products. In 2024, Bangladesh exported apparel items worth $7.34 billion to the US with a marginal growth of 0.75 per cent. On Wednesday, US president Donald Trump announced hefty duties on multiple countries as part of sweeping global tariffs, branding the move ‘Liberation Day’. In line with the Trump’s policy of imposing at least half of the tariff on US goods, Bangladesh has been slapped with 37 per cent tariff as the Trump team calculated that Bangladesh imposes about 74 per cent tariffs on imports from the US. Currently, most Bangladeshi goods in the US face a 15 per cent tariff. Among major competitors, China faces 34 per cent, Vietnam 46 per cent, Cambodia 49 per cent, and Sri Lanka 44 per cent, while India and Pakistan face 26 per cent and 29 per cent tariffs, respectively. Talking to New Age, Faruque Hassan, former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), called for diplomatic, political, and commercial measures to resolve the issue. ‘The US cites tariffs, currency manipulation, and non-tariff barriers as reasons, but Bangladesh does not have such issues,’ he said. He urged the government to resolve the dispute through negotiations rather than retaliatory duties, emphasising a ‘win-win’ approach. He also said that Bangladesh’s export sector would not be disproportionately affected since competing nations face high tariffs. Fazlul Hoque, managing director of Plummy Fashion, told New Age that the immediate impact of the US reciprocal tariff on Bangladesh will be US buyers’ pressure on manufacturers for cutting price. ‘However, I do not believe the country’s apparel exports will be heavily affected, as we largely export basic garments,’ former BKMEA president Fazlul Hoque said. He said that Bangladeshi manufacturers would inevitably have to lower product prices in response to growing buyer pressure, and the government should convene a meeting with stakeholders without delay to devise a strategy to manage the challenges posed by the US tariff. He said that while exports would hopefully not decrease significantly, policy support would be needed to face the challenges of the US tariff. Fazlul explained that since Bangladesh exports essential items, US retailers would unlikely increase their prices. He said that to keep retail prices unchanged, retailers would absorb a portion of the increased costs caused by the additional tariff, while the remaining portion would be passed on to manufacturers. ‘The US has imposed tariffs on nearly all its trading partners worldwide, and while it is good news for Bangladesh that Vietnam and Cambodia face higher tariffs, it is concerning that India, Pakistan, and Indonesia have lower tariffs,’ Fazlul said. He said that the Indian government offered attractive packages to attract investment in the readymade garment sector, and the country increased its capacity in the past couple of years. ‘It is true the inquiry of the US buyers in India increased significantly in past few years but the supply base of Indian apparel sector is yet to be strong,’ Fazlul mentioned. BGMEA administrator Anwar Hossain said that they were not ready for this as it came suddenly. ‘However, regional trade rivals also were in a worse situation. Compared with our competitors like China, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, we are still ahead as their tariff is higher than us,’ he added. Professor Mustafizur Rahman, distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said that Bangladesh is the 5th largest importer of US cotton, which is used to make RMG items and export them to the US. As Trump said that tariffs on imported cotton from the US will be relaxed, he suggested addressing the issue through the Trade and Investment Cooperation Forum Agreement (TICFA) and focusing on enhancing competitiveness, reducing business costs, and diversifying markets. Zahid Hussain, former lead economist at the World Bank’s Dhaka office, echoed concerns, telling New Age that the higher tariffs would hurt Bangladesh’s exports due to a decline in US consumer demand. He also said that overall price increase due to tariffs would reduce consumers’ purchasing capacity. He stressed the need for Bangladesh to engage in negotiations to clarify the 74 per cent tariff calculation and highlight any recent reforms that could justify exemptions. ‘Bangladesh’s major competitors Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka will not necessarily gain any additional advantage from this situation,’ he added. South Asian Network on Economic Modelling executive director Selim Raihan also has expressed deep concern. ‘This imposition will not only harm Bangladesh but also many other developing countries,’ he warned. He urged Bangladeshi policymakers to engage with their US counterparts to address concerns over the tariff, mainly due to the ambiguity surrounding its calculation. Meanwhile, in a press conference, chief adviser’s press secretary Shafiqul Alam said their ongoing work with the US government is expected to help address the tariff issue. ‘Bangladesh is reviewing its tariffs on products imported from the United States,’ said the press secretary. He said the National Board of Revenue is identifying options to rationalise tariffs, which is necessary to address the matter.

{"title": "New Age | RMG workers’ union wants parley with US", "body": "Sammilita Garment Sramik Federation urged the interim government to engage in diplomatic talks with the US over the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, emphasising the need for an acceptable solution to prevent negative impacts of the tariff on workers. In a statement signed by the federation president Nazma Akter and general secretary Khadiza Akter on Sunday, it urged the government to implement urgent social security measures and alternative employment solutions to safeguard the interests of workers. The labour rights platform expressed concern over the recent 37 per cent increase in tariffs on Bangladeshi products by the US government, describing it as worrying for the country. The trade union leaders also called on the American government to reconsider the increased tariff and show a cooperative attitude to save the Bangladesh garment industry and its workers. The statement mentioned that buyers also have an important role to play in ensuring that the impact of the US tariffs would not affect workers’ wages. The federation’s statement highlighted that Bangladesh heavily relied on the readymade garment sector for foreign exchange earnings, with over four million workers — predominantly women — employed in the sector, which remained the backbone of the economy amid a lack of alternative employment opportunities for women. The federation said that the high tariff might force many Bangladeshi garment exporters to withdraw from the US market ultimately impacting women employment. The statement reminded global brands and buyers of their responsibility, saying that they must play a crucial role in addressing the issue, as the lives and livelihoods of workers could be at significant risk and uncertainty.

{"title": "New Age | BGMEA seeks buyers’ support in tariff issues", "body": "The country’s apparel manufacturers urged buyers to be patient and support them regarding the United States’ tariff on Bangladeshi export items. Md Anwar Hossain, administrator of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, made the call in a letter sent to the buyers, brands, and retailers. He said that with the continued support of the buyers, Bangladesh is striving to make the industry globally competitive, sustainable, and socially impactful, particularly for the millions of workers, many of whom are women, whose livelihoods depend on this sector. ‘We believe that with solidarity and collaboration, we will be able to address these challenges effectively,’ the letter reads. The recent announcement of the reciprocal tariff, particularly the 37 per cent tariff on Bangladeshi exports to the United States, has placed the country’s manufacturers in an unexpectedly challenging situation. As the US remains the single largest export market, accounting for nearly one-fifth of the apparel exports, this sudden measure has caused deep concern among Bangladesh exporters and the buyer community retailing in the United States. ‘We fully recognise that this has created pressure at your end. The uncertainty surrounding cost structures, supply chain planning, and long-term sourcing decisions is significant, and we acknowledge your circumstances with utmost sincerity,’ he added. He also said that the government of Bangladesh and the private sector are treating this issue with the utmost seriousness and the government has already consulted with key industry stakeholders, and further high-level discussions are expected imminently. The government has also engaged with US authorities, sincerely intending to align our bilateral trade relationship, he said. ‘We are aware that several brands and retailers have already reached out to their Bangladeshi suppliers, expressing concern, and in some cases, discussing possible measures to mitigate the impact,’ he said adding that transferring the burden downstream to suppliers at this early stage will only exacerbate the stress. In this regard, he urged the buyers to be patient. On April 3, the United States imposed a steep 37 per cent reciprocal tariff on Bangladeshi exports, raising concerns about the resultant economic fallout and declining trade competitiveness for Bangladesh.

{"title": "New Age | Italy's Prada says to buy rival Versace for 1.25 bn euros", "body": "Italian fashion house Prada announced Thursday that it had reached a deal with US group Capri Holdings to buy Versace for 1.25 billion euros ($1.39 billion). The acquisition will create a luxury group with revenues of over six billion euros that could better compete with industry giants such as the French conglomerates LVMH and Kering amid a slowdown in the sector worldwide. ‘We are delighted to welcome Versace to the Prada Group and to build a new chapter for a brand with which we share a strong commitment to creativity, craftmanship and heritage,’ Prada group chairman and executive director Patrizio Bertelli said in a statement. In 2018, Capri paid €1.83 billion (then $2.1 billion) to acquire Versace, which was previously owned 80 per cent by the Versace family and 20 percent by the US investment fund BlackRock. Amid declining sales, it put the Milan-based label up for sale, and began exclusive negotiations with Prada at the end of February. Capri, which also owns Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, had to accept a reduced price from Prada amid the market turmoil caused by US President Donald Trump's tariffs. The Financial Times had reported that the price was initially expected to be about $1.6 billion but had been negotiated downwards in recent days. Last month, Donatella Versace stepped down as creative director after more than 30 years, in what was widely seen as a prelude to the accord. She took over in 1997 following the murder of her older brother Gianni, who founded the Milan-based label in 1978. But on April 1 she was replaced as creative director by Dario Vitale, who has overseen soaring sales at Miu Miu, Prada's sister brand targeting a younger clientele. Donatella Versace, who turns 70 in May, is now the label's chief brand ambassador. Five things to know about Versace Italian fashion giant Versace, the long-held family business known for its flashy, sexy designs and Medusa head logo, will now become part of Prada, its larger rival and polar opposite in terms of style. Gianni Versace, stylist of stars Born in Calabria, southern Italy, to a dressmaker mother, Gianni Versace began designing clothes at a young age and moved to Milan, the fashion capital, when he was 25. In 1978, he presented his first signature collection, with his brother Santo taking care of the label's business arm. ‘He was a 360-degree creator, a real artist, he had a pure creative vision on colours and materials,’ Stefania Saviolo, director of the luxury and fashion centre at Bocconi University, told AFP. Versace wowed the showbiz world, dressing A-listers from Madonna to Elton John and getting 1980s supermodels like Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell and Cindy Crawford to strut their stuff down the catwalk for him. ‘THAT’ dress Gianni Versace's collections were colourful, sexy and over the top. His designs mixed baroque prints, animal skin motifs, bondage-style leather, slits and, especially, ultra-tight fits. At the 1994 premiere of ‘Four Weddings and a Funeral’, he dressed actress Liz Hurley in a famously suggestive black dress. Made from silk and lycra, with a sharply plunging neckline and a long slit up the side, the dress was held together by several oversize golden safety pins. The dress catapulted Hurley, then romantically involved with actor Hugh Grant, to fame and became simply known as ‘THAT dress’. Death and fall On July 15, 1997, Gianni Versace was shot dead by luxury-obsessed serial killer Andrew Cunanan as he returned to his luxury villa in Miami after buying his morning papers. The killing shocked the worlds of fashion and show business at a time when the brand was at its height. Gianni's younger sister Donatella, then in charge of the lower-cost Versus line, took over as artistic director, while Santo kept control of the business side of the enterprise. But the Versace brand's power shrank as management teams succeeded one after the other, employees were laid off and boutiques closed. Donatella Gianni's muse and confidante Donatella Versace had worked for 14 years at the side of her older brother and sunk into depression after his death, going into rehab for drug addiction in 2004. Eternally tanned with dyed blonde hair and a penchant for plastic surgery, she was initially dismissed as a lightweight substitute for her brother. But with time, the younger Versace rose to the challenge, producing her own showstopping creations, such as the barely-there green chiffon jungle dress worn by Jennifer Lopez at the 2000 Grammy Awards. After nearly 30 years as artistic director, the 69-year-old stepped down last month, handing the reins to Dario Vitale, the former design director at Prada's Miu Miu brand. Donatella Versace remains Versace's brand ambassador. New spark Since the US holding company Capri Holdings acquired Versace for about 1.8 billion euros in 2018, it has lost some of its lustre. ‘The Versace brand has become too commercial. Prada can allow it to return to its golden age and reconnect with its luxury DNA,’ fashion consultant Antonio Bandini Conti told AFP. Prada's deeper pockets will help the brand compete in an increasingly crowded field of well-funded luxury brands dominated by France's LVMH fashion conglomerate. Most recently, Versace posted $193 million in revenue for its fiscal 2025 third quarter, down 15 per cent from the period a year earlier.

{"title": "New Age | Sweden drowns in discarded fast fashion items", "body": "Sweden’s recycling centres are overflowing with clothes after an EU-wide ban this year on throwing away textiles, leaving overwhelmed municipalities eager to have fast fashion giants take responsibility. ‘It’s a huge amount coming in every day. It’s been crazy, it’s a huge increase,’ said Brian Kelly, secretary general of the Artikel2 charity shop in Stockholm, where rows of bins were overfilled with discarded apparel. Since the beginning of this year, EU countries must have separate textile recycling, alongside existing processes for glass, paper and food waste. The aim is to promote circular waste management, where textiles are sorted and reused, or recycled if they are not too damaged. ‘We have seen a 60-per cent increase in textiles collected in January and February this year compared with the same period last year,’ said Karin Sundin, an expert on textile waste at Stockholm city’s waste and recycling management company Stockholm Vatten och Avfall. Once the textiles are sorted, some 60 to 70 per cent is designated for reuse, and 20 to 30 per cent for recycling as padding, isolation or composite materials. Around seven to 10 per cent is burned for energy, according to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. That is a huge improvement from before the new law, according to experts, who note that discarded clothing used to be systematically incinerated. However, a lack of infrastructure in Sweden means used clothes are largely exported abroad, primarily to Lithuania, where they are sorted, reused, or burned for energy. ‘We don’t have the big sorting plants that can put everything into value in the same way that they have in eastern Europe for example,’ explained Sundin. ‘The reason is that it’s so labour intensive (and) costs a lot of money,’ she said as she gave AFP a tour of the Ostberga recycling centre in southern Stockholm. Swedes throw away 90,000 tonnes of textiles per year, or 10 kilogram (22 pounds) per person, according to the Swedish Society for the Conservation of Nature. The EU average is 19 kilogram, according to 2022 statistics, up from 17 in 2019, data from the European Environment Agency showed. The clothing industry also pollutes the environment. To make a t-shirt that weighs 135 gram (4.76 ounces), 2,500 litres (660 gallons) of water and one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of chemicals are needed, noted Yvonne Augustsson, advisor at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. ‘That means greenhouse gas emissions of around two to five kilos,’ she said. ‘In Sweden, an article of clothing is used on average 30 times. If you double this to 60 times — which seems reasonable — you reduce the climate impact by half,’ she said. Textile sorting in Sweden is handled by municipalities, many of which have been overburdened by the quantities received since the introduction of the new law. In the sparsely populated north, some towns, such as Kiruna, continue to incinerate textiles because they have no takers for the items. Fast fashion giants, such as H&M and Zara, are expected to eventually play a role in handling the waste they help generate, and negotiations are ongoing at the European level to determine their responsibility. According to a preliminary agreement EU member states reached in February, clothing giants will be responsible for the end of lifetime of the products they sell, required to pay for collection, sorting, reuse and recycling. The idea is to encourage fast fashion retailers to produce ‘clothing designed to last longer,’ said Augustsson. Swedish brand H&M told AFP it welcomed moves in that direction. Consumers also need to change their mindset. Each person should ‘buy no more than five new articles of clothing per year,’ said Beatrice Rindevall, head of the Swedish Society for the Conservation of Nature, which regularly organises clothing swaps. In the town of Linkoping on a sunny spring day, a clothing exchange on a student campus had racks featuring everything from a hot pink jacket with feathered sleeves to faded jeans, bags and striped t-shirts. ‘People can give us clothes in good condition that they don’t wear anymore (and) exchange them for something else,’ volunteer Eva Vollmer said. ‘We focus on creating the solution so that people actually have an alternative.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/262132/sweden-drowns-in-discarded-fast-fashion-items", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 724}
{"title": "New Age | Utilise 90-day pause on US tariffs on export: experts", "body": "Economists and industry insiders urged the government to use the 90-day hiatus in the United States administration’s tariffs on exporting items to most countries, including Bangladesh. They also said that it is unclear what will happen after 90 days, and this pause is not a solution, so the government must go for a long-term, sustainable solution. They were speaking at a roundtable titled ‘US Tariffs on Bangladesh’s Exports: Reciprocal Strategies and the Way Forward for Negotiations’, which was organised by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association along with trade bodies from textiles, pharmaceuticals, plastics, and other sectors in the capital on Saturday. In his speech, M Masrur Reaz, chairman of the Policy Exchange Bangladesh, said that the government should take action and utilize the 90-day pause. ‘If we couldn’t seize the opportunity, we have to ring scramble alert again after 90 days. Through negotiation, we have to know the expectations of the US government regarding Bangladesh, their priorities, and their specific asks on trade surplus and tariff,’ he added. He also asked the government to set the offerings if they want to offer to the US government. ‘We are in an advantageous position regarding cotton imports, as our major competitors like India and Pakistan rely on their cotton, whereas we import it,’ he added. He said that Bangladesh has to initiate some strategic offerings, as the US must import from Bangladesh, thanks to high product value in Vietnam and China. Through coordination mechanisms and dialogue, Bangladesh can benefit from these geoeconomic issues. He also urged the government to define concisely how US tariffs impact the country’s economy, not fully trust the US administration, and seek market-based and content-based solutions. If Bangladesh wants to import more cotton from the US, it must establish proper infrastructure and a free zone for US cotton in the ports. Muhibuzzaman, chairman of ACI Pharmaceuticals, said that the new tariff will hit the country’s major industries and value chain. However, as the US has decided to impose a 90-day pause, the government has the time to negotiate, and it should do so strategically. He also stated that the pharmaceutical industry will face a significant challenge in the form of LDC graduation, which could negatively impact the sector. Without the generic, Bangladeshi manufacturers won’t be able to produce new products, he added. In his speech, Md Anwar Hossain, administrator of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the government is working on three fronts: tariff issues, LDC graduation, and transshipment through India. ‘However, the businesses also should help the government by providin required data. We should work through both on diplomatic channels and policy fronts,’ he added. He also said that the industry and government work together for sustainability and compliance. Anwar-Ul Alam Chowdhury Parvez urged the government to defer the LDC graduation by three years as the industries are yet to prepare. ‘The government should resolve the issues related the NBR, gas and energy supply to attract investment,’ he added. He urged the government to take immediate action through diplomacy and negotiations regarding the US tariff. Hafizur Rahman, administrator of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that Bangladesh should focus on reducing its trade gap with the US and must identify the US expectations of Bangladesh. ‘Vietnam and India might be signing an FTA with the USA soon, so Bangladesh should also focus on rationalizing trade and negotiations,’ he added, urging the government not to take any rigid decision. Ganosamhati Andolan chief coordinator Zonayed Saki said that signing an FTA with the USA is important along with attempt to improve bilateral trade relations. He also said as Bangladesh is going to be graduated from the LDC, the country must focus on labour law, labour situation, compliance and environmental policy. Shamim Ahmed, the president of the Bangladesh Plastic Goods Manufacturers and Exporters Association, also spoke at the event. BTMA president Showkat Aziz Russell moderated the event.

{"title": "New Age | Apparel leaders seek incentive on US cotton", "body": "Apparel industry leaders have urged the government to offer an additional incentive to help offset the higher cost of importing cotton from the United States as part of efforts to reduce the trade gap with the country. They made the appeal at a discussion, titled “BAYLA Roadmap 2030: Resetting the Competitive Edge, Rethinking Bangladesh’s Apparel Industry”, organised by the Bangladesh Apparel Youth Leaders Association (BAYLA) held at a hotel in the capital on Saturday. The industry leaders also put emphasis on addressing high air freight costs and inefficiencies at ports to expedite further the trade growth. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), called for a reduction in tariffs to prepare for post-LDC graduation and challenges from US tariffs. High duties on imported man-made fibres remain a concern, he said. He also highlighted the existing challenges within the banking sector and various other areas, including the National Board of Revenue (NBR) and customs. Hatem said, “The government has, however, initiated measures to address these issues in certain sectors, particularly concerning the NBR.” Envoy Textile Limited Chairman Kutubuddin Ahmed noted that US cotton costs about four cents more per pound than cotton from other sources. He said importers could be encouraged to buy from the US if the government adjusted its current incentive scheme accordingly. “If the government gives us this amount of extra money as an incentive for importing US cotton instead of the existing cash incentive, then entrepreneurs will be encouraged to import cotton from there,” said Kutubuddin, also a former president of the BGMEA. Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury Parvez, former BGMEA president, underscored the need for addressing high interest rates, rising utility prices and bureaucratic delays at ports. He said Bangladesh is often labeled as a country of cheap labour, but if the country’s situation is compared with Vietnam, then it could be found that their transport, interest rates, logistics and other associated costs are significantly lower. Importers also called for reduced harassment at customs, faster clearance at ports, and improved infrastructures to maintain Bangladesh’s export competitiveness. Other speakers included BGMEA administrator Mohammad Anwar Hossain, former BGMEA president Faruque Hassan and Ananta Group Managing Director Sharif Zahir while BAYLA President Abrar Hossain Sayem moderated the session.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports grew 10.84pc in July-March", "body": "The country’s readymade garment exports witnessed a healthy growth of 10.84 per cent during the July-March period of the current financial year fetching $30.25 billion that highlights the resilience and potentials of the apparel sector. This was revealed since the Export Promotion Bureau recently published the country-wise export data for the July-March period of the financial year 2024-25. The data revealed that the European Union continues to be a pivotal market, which represented 49.82 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports, with a total value of $15.07 billion. Exports to the United States reached $5.74 billion, representing 18.97 per cent of the total share, while Canada totalled $963.85 million with a 3.19 per cent market share, and the UK market was also important, with exports worth $3.36 billion, which is 11.10 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports during the specified period. Regarding growth, Bangladesh’s RMG exports to the EU grew significantly by 11.31 per cent year-over-year, with the USA demonstrating a strong increase of 17.23 per cent and Canada registering an increase of 15.66 per cent. However, RMG exports to the UK exhibited a more modest growth rate of 4.14 per cent. Within the EU, Germany stood out as a significant market, with Bangladesh’s exports valued at $3.80 billion, followed by Spain at $2.65 billion, France at $1.65 billion, Italy at $1.17 billion, Poland at $1.26 billion, and the Netherlands at $1.61 billion. Growth rates were especially notable in Germany (10.72 per cent), France (10.75 per cent), the Netherlands (23.15 per cent), Poland (10.32 per cent), Denmark (12.80 per cent), and Sweden (19.96 per cent). Bangladesh’s RMG sector also showcased growth in non-traditional markets, with an overall rise of 6.66 per cent, where total exports reached $5.12 billion, capturing 16.93 per cent of Bangladesh’s total exports, indicating potential for further expansion. Among these markets, Japan led with imports totalling $960.45 million, followed by Australia at $653.64 million and India at $535.15 million. Exports to countries such as Turkey and Mexico are significant as well, amounting to $357.22 million and $251.22 million, respectively, with a commendable growth rate of 20.45 per cent by India, 10.06 per cent by Japan, 23.44 per cent by Mexico, and 32.54 per cent by Turkey. While growth in Japan, Australia, India, Turkey, and Mexico is positive during this timeframe, exports to Russia, Korea, the UAE, and Malaysia have diminished. Negative growth in the UAE, Malaysia, and Korea suggests the need for further efforts in these markets. The knitwear sector has shown a total growth of 11.22 per cent, while growth has suffered particularly in non-traditional markets. The woven sector has also seen a growth of 10.40 per cent, with slower growth in the UK but considerably higher growth in non-traditional markets. The ongoing growth in exports significantly depends on the EU and USA, which continue to be the main markets for Bangladesh, indicating further potential within these areas. Talking to BSS, Mohiuddin Rubel, former director, BGMEA, managing director, Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and additional managing director, Denim Expert Ltd, said it shows the significance of the major/traditional markets in our total export growth. ‘The moderate growth in the non-traditional market underscores the importance of further research and focus in this category, as it possesses substantial growth potential, which will also help to balance reliance on traditional markets,’ he said. Rubel also said that persistent global trade tensions are constantly reshaping the global environment, creating opportunities that Bangladesh could take advantage of.

{"title": "New Age | Apparel exporters likely to pay $250m monthly", "body": "PROPOSED 37PC US TARIFF The country's apparel manufacturers expressed concern that if the 37 per cent tariff on readymade garment (RMG) exports to the US market is not fully withdrawn, Bangladesh’s leading export sector may face an average monthly duty burden of $250 million. Due to the extra burden, about 1,000 factories could be adversely affected. They urged the interim government to engage in discussions with the US administration and take the necessary steps to ensure the tariff›s permanent withdrawal. They were speaking at the inauguration of the election office and a prayer session organized by the Sammilita Parishad, an election panel of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, in the capital on Saturday. Md Abul Kalam, panel leader of Sammilita Parishad and managing director of Chaity Group, said that the 90-day suspension of the 37 per cent tariff on exports to the US market is a positive step. ‘We extend our thanks to the Chief Adviser of the interim government, Dr Muhammad Yunus, for writing to President Donald Trump in this regard. However, the tariff has not been fully withdrawn,’ he added. They are still unsure what will happen after 90 days, and they urged the government to continue diplomatic efforts and personal engagement. ‘If the tariff is not permanently removed, the RMG sector will be forced to pay an additional $250 million in duties every month,’ he added. He also said they generally profit about 3 per cent to 4 per cent. If the tariff is not withdrawn, it will be tough for about 100 factories to survive. While buyers are typically responsible for paying tariffs, current buying patterns show a tendency for buyers to pass on the extra costs to suppliers, he added. Former BGMEA President and Chief Coordinator of the Sammilita Parishad for the BGMEA Election 2025–2027, Faruque Hassan, said that the industry›s consistent success owes a great deal to the Sammilita Parishad›s efforts and leadership. He urged the government to request a minimum three-year extension for Bangladesh’s graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status. Regarding the US tariff, he said that if the tariff structure were reciprocal, their duties would have been significantly reduced. ‘The reality is that the US has imposed these tariffs to reduce its trade deficit,’ he added. However, he also said the government should not make unnecessary or premature commitments. Sammilita Parishad President Quazi Moniruzzaman called on all stakeholders to unite to secure victory in the upcoming BGMEA election. BNP Leader Zainul Abedin Farrouque, Bangladesh Garments Buying House Association President Mofazzal Hossain Pavel, BGMEA Advisory Committee Member Asif Ashraf, and Bangladesh Apparel Youth Leaders Association (BAYLA) President Abrar Hossain Sayem also spoke at the event.

{"title": "New Age | BGMEA enrolls 128 new RMG factories", "body": "113 units closed in 15 months About 113 readymade garment factory units under the membership of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association have been closed in the last 15 months, from January 2024 to March 2025. According to a source from the BGMEA, about 128 new factories received BGMEA memberships during this time. The source also said that about 96,104 workers lost their jobs during the mentioned period, while about 74,081 workers got new employment due to newly established factory units. In the meantime, the RMG exports also witnessed a healthy growth of 10.84 per cent to $30.25 billion in the July-March period of FY25, according to the Export Promotion Bureau data, meaning the operational situation is almost normal in the sector. Industry insiders said that entry and exit in the private sector are very common and occur every year, though recent political discourses have fueled this. After the ousting of the then prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, in August, 69 factory units were closed permanently from August 24 to March 25. The industry people said that the factory units were shut down for several reasons: excessive and abnormal bank loans, hiding of the owners, lack of work orders, and interruption in gas and energy supply. Moreover, most of the closed factories were in the small and medium category, which lost its competitiveness long ago. Due to political changes in August 2024, some notable factories closed due to their close ties with the ousted government, which resulted in them receiving abnormal loans from the banks. Meanwhile, the labour leaders said that more than 1 lac initially unemployed people were able to find new workplaces, and about 75,000 of them were able to, meaning about 30,000-40,000 workers are still unemployed. Talking to New Age, Faruque Hassan, former president of the BGMEA, said that political and economic factors have contributed to the recent shutdown of several factories. He also said that several cases of labour unrest and internal management issues have led to factory closures. Moreover, some factories faced order cancellations or failed to secure regular work, making paying gas and other utility bills challenging. The stakeholders also said that in some politically sensitive situations, owners were absent from their factories due to ongoing complications, while carrying large outstanding loans from banks. During the previous government›s tenure, many owners had relatively easy access to bank loans. However, following the political shift, they no longer received the same level of support from financial institutions. For these reasons, the units could not sustain their operations. Former BGMEA President Faruque Hassan said it is important to note that during the same period, many new factories have started operations, gained BGMEA membership, and created new employment opportunities. ‘Every year, some factories shut down while others open—this is part of the natural cycle of a large industrial sector,’ he added. But this time, he added that the closures of factories owned by a few well-known figures after the political transition have made the issue more prominent. The industry people said several RMG factory units were closed due to financial difficulties, political instability, and the absence of owners. The political change affected factories owned by people closely associated with the ousted Awami League government. Factory owners, such as Beximco and Nassa, were either in hiding or in custody, which led to the closure of factories. Moreover, a number of factories, such as TNZ and Generation Next closed due to financial crises or utility issues. Talking to New Age, Nazma Akter, president of the Sommilito Garments Sramik Federadtion, said that more than 1 lac workers lost their jobs due to the factories’ closure. ‘However, about 75,000 workers entered their new workplaces. We want the government should take initiatives to make working opportunities for the rest of the workers,’ she added. Former BGMEA Director Mohiuddin Rubel told New Age that the newly opened factory units have already recruited the skilled workers of closed factories. He also said that the pattern of RMG industrialization has changed, as the number of small factories is decreasing while the number of large-scale factories is increasing. ‘The causes of the factory closure are mixed like utility issues, absence of owners which led a weak management, lack of orders,’ he added. However, he said that the government should focus on small factories so that they can survive. Talking to New Age, Professor Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said that a number of factories have been struggling for the past few years. ‘Especially, small factories suffered most due to less competitiveness and global economic issues. After the political changes, owners of a number of factories were in hiding, which also impacted them,’ he added. He also said that entry and exit are normal issues in the private sector. If the factory cannot repay the loans, the government has nothing to do. ‹The government can ensure the rights of the workers so that they can get their benefits. Government must assess the viability and sustainability of every steps,’ he added. He also urged the government to normalize the law and order situation, diversify products, and increase efficiency and worker skills.

{"title": "New Age | Safety condition improves, challenges remain", "body": "RMG SECTOR AFTER RANA PLAZA COLLAPSE Bangladesh’s readymade garment industry has undergone a significant change in the aftermath of the Rana Plaza collapse, one of the deadliest industrial accidents in the country, but there are still in the sector many issues to be addressed. RMG businesses said that once criticised for its unsafe working conditions, the country’s sole multi-billion-dollar export sector had taken serious strides in rebuilding its reputation and restoring global confidence after the tragic accident 12 years ago. However, rights activists, brands and foreign partners said that safety issues in the sector had improved after the accident, but the progress could not be termed sustainable. On April 24, 2013, Rana Plaza, an eight-story building at Savar, on the outskirts of the capital Dhaka, crumbled during working hours, killing 1,138 people, mostly garment workers, and injuring thousands others. Talking to New Age, Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that issues related to safety, compliance and worker rights had experienced a major improvement since the Rana Plaza collapse. ‘However, the incident was a tragic and painful event for the industry and we will have to feel the pain in our whole lifetime,’ he added. Industry insiders said that the factories had followed strict policies to ensure fire, electrical and structural safety and had spent significant amounts of money on those areas. Mohiuddin Rubel, a former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told New Age that in recent years, they had taken major initiatives to ensure a safe working environment in the RMG industry. ‘An extensive reform has been carried out in the industry with the support of the government, buyers, trade unions and other international organisations, including the International Labour Organisation,’ he added. He also said that the government-led initiative and the buyers-led Accord and Alliance inspected about 4,000 factories with the aim of improving safety issues in the units. ‘The building collapse was a tragic incident in the history of this industry. But we have taken that as a turning point and put in all-out efforts to build a safe and sustainable industry,’ he added. He also said that each factory spent on average Tk 5 crore on factory renovation, detailed engineering assessment and retrofitting. A 2021 report by McKinsey consultancy labelled Bangladesh’s RMG sector a frontrunner in transparency regarding factory safety and value-chain responsibility. Another report by QIMA, a global supply chain compliance solutions provider, ranked the country second in the same year’s ethical manufacturing index. Moreover, Bangladesh also amended its labour law twice, in 2013 and 2018, to safeguard workers’ rights and ensure workplace safety. The country increased workers’ minimum wages by 56 per cent in 2023 and raised the increment to 9 per cent from 5 per cent in 2024. In terms of LEED-certified green factories, Bangladesh also witnessed a big jump. Before the Rana Plaza accident, there were only two green factories in the country. Currently, the US Green Building Council has certified 240 Bangladeshi factories as LEED (leadership in energy and environmental design). There are 98 platinum-rated, 128 gold-rated, 10 silver-rated and four certified factories. Moreover, the highest-scoring factory is also from Bangladesh. After the Rana Plaza collapse, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and the Alliance for Bangladesh Workers’ Safety helped the country’s factories to improve their fire, structural and electrical safety measures. The Alliance left the country in 2018 after remediating 93 per cent across 700 factories it inspected, and the Accord, which lasted until 2020, helped standardise fire and building safety in more than 2,000 RMG factories. After their departure, the RMG Sustainability Council, an entity comprised of RMG manufacturers, global brands and retailers, and global unions and their Bangladeshi affiliates, started its journey in 2020. Regarding the RSC, Hatem said that the entity was doing its job as per the global standard, but it also sometimes tried to put artificial pressures on the industry. ‘The biggest paradigm shift since Rana Plaza has been the safety culture that has been developed through public-private partnership in the factories,’ said Mohiuddin. The BGMEA has also framed its new policy on new member enrolment and subcontracting, he said. Despite facing crises like the Rana Plaza collapse, Covid pandemic and global economic turmoil due to the Russia-Ukraine war over the years, the RMG sector’s export earnings have never experienced a hard hit. Bangladesh exported apparel worth $38.48 billion in 2024, a 7.23-per cent increase compared with $35.89 billion in 2023. Talking to New Age, Nazma Akter, president of the Sommilito Garments Sromik Federation, said that the accused in the Rana Plaza case were yet to be punished and most of the accused were in hiding. ‘Accused Rana along with others must be brought to justice,’ she said. ‘The factory authorities are yet to regularise the remediation activities and the government should do it by maintaining global standard,’ she said. She also said that safety issues had improved a lot, but this could not be called sustainability, as accidents and fire incidents were still persistent in the sector, along with the absence of earthquake safety. In some cases, the blacklisting of workers is also persistent, she added, noting that owners had safe passage after committing crimes. Regarding the cases, Hatem said they also demanded punishment of actual criminals.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to EU rise by 37pc in Jan-Feb", "body": "Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the European Union witnessed an increase of 37 per cent to $3.69 billion in January and February of 2025, according to Eurostat data, compiled by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. In the same period of 2024, Bangladesh exported readymade garment items worth $2.70 billion to the 27-nation economic bloc, its largest export destination. Exporters said that several factors contributed to this positive export trend, including value-added garment production, the EU’s economic recovery, duty-free market access, adherence to safety standards and collaborative efforts of manufacturers and workers. These developments have increased buyer confidence, solidifying Bangladesh’s position in the export landscape, they said. During the January-February period of 2025, the EU witnessed a surge in apparel imports, marking a growth of 17.81 per cent, amounting to $16.10 billion, compared with those of $13.67 billion in the same period of 2024. In the reporting period, Bangladesh remained the second-largest supplier of apparel items to the EU. During the period, all major suppliers to the EU, including China, India, Pakistan and Cambodia, experienced substantial growth except for Turkey. China remained the top exporter to the EU, exporting RMG items worth $4.54 billion in January-February of 2025, which was 25.12 per cent up from that of $3.63 billion in the same period of 2024. Turkey secured the third place, though the Eurasian country experienced a negative growth of 3.64 per cent to $1.61 billion, which was $1.67 billion in January-February of 2024. Vietnam posted a 16.58 per cent growth, reaching $759 million in the first two months of 2025, which was $651 million in the corresponding period of 2024. India, Pakistan and Cambodia secured RMG exports worth $865 million, $711 million and $775 million respectively in January-February of 2025, which were 25.60 per cent, 29.65 per cent and 41 per cent higher respectively than those in the same period of the past year. Talking to New Age, Mohiuddin Rubel, former BGMEA director, said that, looking ahead, the outlook remained optimistic with an expected increase in work orders throughout 2025, sustaining growth momentum. ‘As buyers expand their sourcing activities in Bangladesh, the growth trajectory is expected to continue, especially amidst rising tensions between the United States and other countries,’ he added. He added that the data highlighted necessity for strategic adaptations to foster future growth. He also said that despite Bangladesh’s resilience in upholding export levels both in quantity and value, the country must clearly sustain its competitive edge and enhance profit margins amidst persistent global price declines. ‘Key factors such as value addition and expanding market reach remain pivotal for our economic sustainability and prosperity,’ he added. In 2024, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $38.48 billion to its global destinations, where the earnings from the EU were $19.77 billion.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh starts freighter flights as India halts trans-shipment", "body": "The inaugural freighter flight, full of cargo, took off Sylhet’s Osmani International Airport Sunday evening. The cargo flight from the airport began in the backdrop of India’s April 8 suspension of third-country trans-shipment for Bangladesh. The civil aviation and tourism affairs adviser Sheikh Bashir Uddin inaugurated the flight on Sunday evening at the airport. He said that the businesses would have the scope to export goods from Bangladesh from now on even at a lower cost. ‘The cost of carrying goods to Europe from Dhaka came down by 13 per cent than the previous cost,’ he added. A chartered Airbus A330-300 freighter operated by Galistair Aviation departed Sylhet airport Sunday evening, carrying 60 tonnes of readymade garments to Zaragoza of Spain via Dubai. Biman Bangladesh Airlines will provide ground-handling services for the operation. The RMG items will be delivered to Inditex, which is claimed to be the world’s largest fast-fashion brand based in Spain. The Bangladesh ambassador to Mexico, Mushfiqul Fazal Ansary, and the Civil Aviation and Tourism ministry secretary, Nasrin Jahan, among others, addressed the programme. Osmani International Airport director Hafiz Ahmed said that exporting goods from the Sylhet region to Spain would have a positive impact on Bangladesh’s economy. ‘From now on, one cargo flight will go to Spain per week. If the demand of exporting increases, the number of flights will also be increased,’ he said. He said that it would be possible to export agricultural products produced in the Sylhet region to different European countries including the UK if a packaging house was built in Sylhet. A modern cargo complex with a capacity of 100 tons has been built at Osmani International Airport at a cost of Tk 26 crore, Hafiz added. Regarding the cargo shipment from Sylhet, Bangladesh Freight Forwarders Association president Kabir Ahmed said that the service must be consistent. ‘The authority should install all facilities like screening, scanning and all necessary infrastructure to encourage exporters to use the airport regularly,’ he added. However, the success of this initiative will depend heavily on freight rates. Exporters will find it viable if regular flights to Europe can offer freight charges between $2.6 and $2.7 per kilogram. ‘Even with chartered flights, maintaining a freight charge of around $3.5 per kilogram would still be considered competitive,’ he added. He also urged the government not to favour any particular companies in cargo operations at Sylhet and Chattogram airports. Instead, the cargo services should remain open and accessible to all exporters to ensure fair competition and maximize export growth. Mohiuddin Rubel, a former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that increasing competitive capacity was a must in modern business. ‘We use air cargo for exports. The use of air cargo will be higher in the future. In this case, increasing capacity is good for the industry,’ he added. He also urged the government to install air cargo services at other airports. On April 8, India withdrew the trans-shipment facility that allowed cargo to be exported from Bangladesh to third countries through Indian land customs stations. India, in a circular dated June 29, 2020, permitted the movement of Bangladeshi export cargo in containers or closed-body trucks via Indian ports and airports. Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport has long struggled with capacity shortages and operational inefficiencies. According to the BGMEA, from January 2024 to March 2025, Bangladeshi apparel exporters shipped over 34,900 tonnes of garments worth $462.34 million to 36 countries through Indian airports.

{"title": "New Age | BTMA urges adviser to solve gas problems", "body": "The country’s textile millers demanded raising the bulk consumer limit for captive power gas connections to 20 megawatts from the existing 10 MW. They also called for removing the requirement to obtain a No Objection Certificate from power distribution companies for connections up to 20 MW. They placed the demands in a recent letter to Fauzul Kabir Khan, adviser to the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Minerals. The letter, signed by Bangladesh Textile Mills Association president Showkat Aziz Russell, also proposed revising the security deposit requirement for captive gas connections. Instead of the existing two months’ equivalent bill, they proposed limiting it to one month and providing a bank guarantee for the entire deposit. According to a ministry circular, gas connections exceeding 10 MW capacity require an NOC from the relevant power distribution company. The BTMA president said that the 10 MW threshold is outdated in the current industrial landscape, and the NOC acquisition process is complex, which adds unnecessary hurdles to industrial expansion. Textiles and apparel account for over 85 per cent of the country’s total export earnings, and nearly 70 per cent of the supply chain is driven by BTMA-member industries. These industries are heavily reliant on captive power generation, predominantly using natural gas as fuel. However, the cost of production has surged due to the gas price of Tk 42 per cubic meter. According to Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited, captive power consumers with a capacity of 10 megawatts (MW) or more are classified as bulk consumers among public and private power generation entities. However, with the diversified growth and expansion of the country’s industrial sector, the definitions of small, medium, and large industries have evolved significantly. For example, in the spinning sector, a facility with a capacity of 25,000 spindles was previously considered a large industry, whereas a plant must now have a capacity of approximately 100,000 spindles to be categorized as a large industry. In another letter to the adviser, the BTMA president urged the energy ministry to ensure a fair and proportionate gas supply to industries, warning that a continued shortage could lead to widespread factory closures and labour unrest. More alarmingly, BTMA stated that, Titas recently diverted more gas away from industries toward the power sector, exacerbating the crisis. He also said that according to Petrobangla data from February to April 2025, Titas supplied approximately 100 million cubic feet short daily to industries compared with previous periods, while increasing gas supply to the power and fertiliser sectors by the same volume. The letter read, ‹Despite maintaining a stable gas supply to the residential sector, industrial gas deliveries were disproportionately reduced.› Due to the limited gas supply, export-oriented textile mills have been unable to maintain expected production levels. He also said that if the current situation persists, many textile mills may be forced to shut down permanently, jeopardising the timely payment of wages and allowances to workers ahead of Eid-ul-Azha. Russell also said that the BTMA represents 1,856 member mills, covering spinning, weaving, dyeing, printing, and finishing operations. The sector boasts a combined investment of approximately $22 billion, making it the most significant single investment in Bangladesh’s private sector.

{"title": "New Age | Rajshahi Textile Mills to be turned into green industry", "body": "Leading industrial conglomerate PRAN-RFL Group is set to revive the long-defunct Rajshahi Textile Mills, aiming to transform it into the largest environment-friendly industrial hub in northern Bangladesh. Speaking at a ‘Meet the Press’ event on Monday at a hotel in Rajshahi, PRAN-RFL Group’s marketing director Kamruzzaman Kamal announced that trial production at the 26-acre facility had already begun, with a formal inauguration scheduled soon. ‘An investment of approximately Tk 350 crore is planned over the next two years to fully operationalise the project, creating employment opportunities for around 12,000 people,’ he said. ‘The factory will produce a range of export-oriented products, including bags, shoes, and ready-made garments,’ he added. Kamruzzaman noted that the entirely export-focused Barendra Rajshahi Textile Mills Limited would be a fully sustainable green industrial park, equipped with solar energy systems, green zones, and water recycling facilities. Anisur Rahman, executive director of PRAN-RFL’s subsidiary Multi-Line Industries Limited, said that the group signed an agreement with the Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation in October last year to reopen the Rajshahi Textile Mills through a public-private partnership. ‘Within three months, we began trial production by repairing and utilising one of the abandoned sheds, already providing jobs for about 1,000 local residents. Recruitment for an additional 1,000 workers is currently underway,’ he said. Highlighting future plans, Anisur Rahman added that a modern call centre and a skill development centre would be established within the mill premises to enhance the skills of local workers. ‘One of our key objectives is to curb migration to the capital by creating sustainable employment opportunities in Rajshahi. If this project succeeds, we hope to expand even further across the Rajshahi region,’ he added.

{"title": "New Age | Two RMG factories shut amid worker protests", "body": "Two readymade garment factories were shut down indefinitely on Wednesday amid worker protests in Gazipur’s Konabari area. Authorities of the MM Knitwear and Mamun Knitwear Limited announced the closure of the RMG factories under Section 13(1) of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, allowing owners to close an institution partially or completely, in the face of an illegal strike. Workers of the factories said that they saw the closure notice hung on the factory gates on Wednesday morning. The Mamun Knitwear Limited closure notice, signed by its assistant manager, read that workers of their garment division showed disobedience and made chaos by stopping work on Tuesday morning. Despite requested by the factory authorities, the workers staged an ‘illegal’ strike inside the factory. The MM Knitwear notice, also signed by its assistant manager, also made the same statement like that of the other company. According to the police, the MM Group has three factories in Konabari area and its owners laid off about 300 workers from the three factories recently for allegedly ‘misbehaviour’ of some workers. They, however, paid the dues of the affected workers. Factory authorities issued an indefinite closure notice at about 10:00pm on Tuesday after the workers went on strike following rumours that some workers were beaten up during this time. Seeking anonymity, some workers said that they stopped work after some of their laid-off colleagues were beaten by the owners. MM Knitwear Limited administrative officer Monowar Hossain claimed that the allegations of beating up the laid-off workers were baseless. Gazipur industrial police superintendent AKM Zahirul Islam said that the authorities declared the factory closed over workers’ misbehaviour. Police personnel were deployed in front of the factory to avoid further troubles, he mentioned.

{"title": "New Age | Businesses offer Tk 550cr for LNG import: Hatem", "body": "Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, mentioned that industrialists have suggested providing Tk 550 crore to the government for the import of liquefied natural gas to help address the ongoing gas shortages in the country’s garment and textile sector. He also said that they proposed it to Petrobangla and Titas, as the import of LNG is delayed due to financial constraints. In an interview with The New Age on Tuesday, he said that in this regard, they urged the state-run organisations to set a mechanism by which they can pay Tk 550 crore for a container or Tk 1,100 crore for two containers as bills of gas in advance and the gas must to be supplied only to the industries of the country. He also said that the authorities should take strict measures to prevent system loss in the gas supply. In the past, the rate of system loss was about 13 per cent, which has been lowered to 10 per cent recently. ‘It means they have the ability to stop system loss and if they want, they can resolve it shortly,’ he added. He also said that the manufacturers are facing issues in opening letters of credit with the banks. Regarding labour issues, Mohammad Hatem said that the BKMEA is a pro-labour organisation that always tries to provide better facilities to the workers of its member factories. The workers, labour leaders, and unions are also cooperating with the sector to grow and address the challenges. ‘However, unfortunately, a number miscreants have entered into the sector in guise of laboures, who are continuously trying to create unrest in the sector pressing their illogical and unrealistic demands,’ he added. He alleged that being instigated by vested interests, they stage protests for the demands those go against the Bangladesh Labour Act. Regarding the recent suspension of the transshipment to the third country through India, he said that all challenges pave the way for new potentials. ‘We already initiated cargo flight from the Sylhet airport, even at the lower costs. If the government can manage it properly, it will be a game changer in the cargo transport,’ he added. He also shared his view on the recent tariff imposed by the United States, urging the government to take immediate diplomatic action. ’90-day pause by the US is not a permanent or sustainable solution. Our government should take immediate action through diplomatic channel to solve the issue so that we do not fall in trouble after 90 days,’ he added. He urged the National Board of Revenue to reform the structural complexities to remove non-tariff barriers. ‘To protect ourselves from the purview of the US tariff, we must narrow the trade imbalance. In this regard, we can increase the import of cotton, soybean and other products from the US,’ he added. However, he added that the abnormal imposition of tariffs on Chinese products may accelerate the shifting of work orders to Bangladesh. ‘We urge to the government to do something within 90-days timeframe. As time is limited, the government must step up to resolve this,’ he added. Regarding the upcoming budget for the financial year 2025-26, he urged the government to abolish tariffs on importing solar system equipment, as this would accelerate sustainable manufacturing. Moreover, he also urged the government to resolve all the complexities related to the taxation system. The RMG sector has many outstanding dues from Russian buyers due to the complexities in the payment gateway. On the other hand, the country has to pay the bills for Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant to Russia. In this regard, he urged the government to take necessary initiatives for getting outstanding dues from Russia or to seek a mechanism of a barter system to adjust the reciprocal payments.

{"title": "New Age | Russian buyers block $7.6m payment to Bangladesh apparel makers", "body": "Several exporters of the country’s readymade garment sector are unable to recover $7.6 million from Russian buyers due to transaction complications, said Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. He said that a total of fourteen Bangladeshi readymade garment exporters exported items to Russia, but were unable to recover $7.6 million for more than a year. He was speaking at a meet-the-press event on contemporary issues in the sector and the upcoming BKMEA election, organised by Progressive Knit Alliance, a contesting panel for the BKMEA election. A total of 38 candidates, 35 from Progressive Knit Alliance and 3 are independents, will contest for the BKMEA election slated for May 10 for the 2025-27 tenure. Hatem said that primarily due to transaction complications, buyers in Russia could not pay the amount to Bangladesh. ‘To resolve the issue, we urge that the stuck amount be adjusted against Bangladesh’s payable dues for the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant through introducing a barter system,’ he added. It is to be noted that Bangladesh has also been unable to make payments to Russia for the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant due to transaction complications following US sanctions imposed after the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war. In economics, a barter system is a method of trade in which goods and services are exchanged directly for other goods and services without using money. In response to a journalist’s question, he said that due to the India-Pakistan war, Bangladeshi garment exporters would not face significant losses in sourcing raw materials. However, border trade will be disrupted for Bangladesh and its other South Asian neighbours, such as Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, he said. Hatem, panel leader and also the current president of the BKMEA, said that if they were be elected, they would work to diversify the market for the readymade garment sector, especially to work proactively to explore untapped markets worldwide by reducing dependency on the US and Europe. He added that they would negotiate with the government regarding the withdrawal of the latest ban on yarn import through land ports, which hampered the country’s small and medium-sized industries. He said that they would take necessary steps in collaboration with the government, relevant ministries, and departments to resolve the fuel crisis and ensure an uninterrupted and reliable gas supply to the industrial sector, which would support the sustained growth and development of industries. ‘We will take measures to prevent buyers from engaging in unethical practices such as offering low prices, taking products without payment, forcing discounts, and taking delivery of goods without paying through collusion with buying houses, freight forwarders, or shipping lines,’ he added. In cases of order cancellations or similar incidents, they will notify the relevant parties and will disseminate the information widely to ensure awareness and prevent such occurrences. He also said that they would work to resolve the complexity of HS codes to ensure smoother trade and compliance and to eliminate complications in importing raw materials and exporting goods under Free of Costs. ‘We will take necessary steps in collaboration with the National Board of Revenue to resolve issues related VAT, taxation and exemption for export-oriented factories and harassment in various forms related to VAT and Tax,’ he added. BKMEA executive president Fazlee Shamim Ehsan, other panel leaders and manufacturers were also present at the press conference.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports from Bangladesh to US soar by 26.66pc in Jan-Mar", "body": "The country’s readymade garment exports to the United States, Bangladesh’s single largest export destination, witnessed a growth of 26.66 per cent in January-March period of 2025 to $2.22 billion, amid fears of tariffs imposed by the US. According to the latest data published by the Office of Textiles and Apparel, Bangladeshi exporters exported RMG items worth $1.55 billion in the corresponding period of 2024. During the first quarter of 2025, Bangladesh outpaced its major competitors in terms of export growth rates. In the first three months of 2025, the North American country’s RMG imports from its global suppliers increased by 10.96 per cent to $20.04 billion, compared with those of $18.06 billion in the same period of 2024. In terms of volume, Bangladeshi RMG exports to the US in January-March of 2025 saw a positive growth of 25.24 per cent to 733.99 million square metres from that of 586.04 million square metre in the same period of 2024, Otexa data stated. Bangladesh’s market share in the North American country stood at 9.61 per cent in the first quarter of 2025. According to the Otexa data, amid the ongoing trade war between the US and China, Vietnam outperformed China as the highest exporter to the US in the first quarter of 2025, while China slipped to the second place. Among the major suppliers, US apparel imports from Vietnam experienced a positive growth of 13.98 per cent to $3.88 billion in January-March, from that of $3.4 billion in 2024. Vietnam held a market share of 19.2 per cent. The Otexa data stated that China exported apparel items worth $3.60 billion in the reporting period, a positive growth of 4.11 per cent from that of $3.45 billion in the same period of 2024, claiming a market share of 20.50 per cent. Followed by Bangladesh, India secured the fourth position by exporting apparel items worth $1.51 billion in January-March of 2025, registering a positive growth of 24.04 per cent compared with that of $1.22 billion in the same period of 2024, with a market share of 6.13 per cent in the US. According to the data, the US’ RMG imports from Indonesia surged by 20 per cent to $1.23 billion. In comparison, RMG imports from Cambodia increased by 14.70 per cent to $927.09 million in the same period. This made Indonesia and Cambodia hold the fifth and sixth place respectively with a market share of 5.48 per cent and 4.83 per cent. However, the country’s RMG manufacturers are still concerned about the US’ 37 per cent tariff imposition on all Bangladeshi exporting products, though it has been paused for 90 days. They said that the 90-day pause was not a permanent or sustainable solution and the government should take immediate action through diplomatic channels to resolve the issue before 90 days. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the country must narrow trade imbalance to protect exporters from the US tariff. However, he said, the abnormal imposition of tariffs on Chinese products accelerated the shifting of work orders to Bangladesh, impacting US exports. Mohiuddin Rubel, a former Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association director, said that China’s export growth to the US lagged behind during the period and Bangladesh might have captured a share of China’s declining orders. He, however, said that the impacts of the new US trade policies were yet to unfold and urged the government to take proper actions. According to the Otexa data, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the US in 2024 saw a marginal 0.75 per cent growth to reach $7.34 billion compared with those of $7.29 billion in 2023 amid fluctuations in shipments throughout the year.

{"title": "New Age | Hatem-led panel wins in BKMEA election", "body": "Mohammad Hatem-led panel, the Progressive Knit Alliance, will lead the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh’s influential knitwear trade body, for the 2025-27 tenure, as the Alliance secured all 35 directorships in the biennial election of the association. Under Progressive Knit Alliance and independent candidates, 38 candidates took part in the elections held on Saturday in Dhaka and Narayanganj for the 35-directorship position. Election officials said that 431 BKMEA members exercised their voting rights out of 572 (75.35 per cent) eligible members in the elections. Of them, 272 were in the Narayanganj zone, 140 were in the Dhaka zone, and 57 were in the Chittagong zone. Progressive Knit Alliance, the only contesting panel in the biennial election, won all 35 seats, while three independent candidates failed to secure any directorship positions. Voting started at 9:00 am and continued until 5:00 pm without any break. This year, polling took place at two centres, one in Dhaka and the other in Narayanganj. No voting centres were set up in Chattogram despite a significant number of voters residing in the area. According to the BKMEA Election Board, voters from Chattogram cast their votes at the Dhaka or Narayanganj centres, depending on their preference. According to the BKMEA›s existing electoral system, a president, an executive president, and seven vice presidents will be elected from the victorious directors. Usually, the panel leader is elected as president. In line with that, Mohammad Hatem, managing director of MB Knit Fashion Ltd, is set to become the president of BKMEA for 2025-27, having also served as the president since August 25, 2024, as the then-president, AKM Salim Osman, resigned after the ousting of the Awami League regime. According to the BKMEA›s election schedule, the office bearer election will take place on May 15. Nine office bearers will be elected for the 2025-27 tenure. The final result of the office bearer will be published on May 17, and the new board will take over leadership for the next two years. In a significant shift after 13 years of suspended democracy, members of the BKMEA are finally regaining their right to vote for their leadership. No member votes have been cast since the last election in 2012, and the organisation has been effectively controlled by a single leader through seven consecutive unopposed terms. AKM Salim Osman, who also serves as the Member of Parliament for Narayanganj-5, has held the presidency of the BKMEA for over a decade without facing an electoral contest. The last competitive election was in 2012, when Md Fazlul Haque, managing director of Narayanganj-based Plummy Fashions Ltd, ran for president. Following that vote, Osman consolidated his position, with the board repeatedly formed by internal consensus, bypassing the general membership’s voting rights. Even as recently as July 2023, Osman was reappointed president without an election. However, the political landscape shifted with the fall of the Awami League government in August 2024, opening the door to long-suppressed democratic processes within the BKMEA. The upcoming election marks the first time in more than a decade that the organisation’s general members will have a say in its leadership. Industry observers view the restoration of electoral competition as a landmark moment for the BKMEA, which represents one of Bangladesh’s most critical export sectors and plays a central role in the country’s economy. Earlier on May 7, Hatem said that they would work to diversify the market for the readymade garment sector, negotiate with the government regarding the withdrawal of the latest ban on yarn import through land ports, and take necessary steps to resolve the fuel crisis and ensure an uninterrupted and reliable gas supply. They would also work to prevent buyers from engaging in unethical practices and resolve issues related to VAT, taxation, harassment, and other VAT-related issues.

{"title": "New Age | Global denim makers see Bangladesh’s competitiveness", "body": "The global manufacturers of denim and denim raw materials, including fibre, chemicals, and yarn, said that Bangladesh would be competitive in the international denim market despite the US tariff and other global trade turmoil. They also said that Bangladesh is the largest denim supplier to the US and European markets, and they are confident in expanding businesses with the South Asian country. On Monday, they spoke with this correspondent at the sidelines of the 18th edition of the two-day Bangladesh Denim Expo, organised by the Bangladesh Apparel Expo in the capital. The Flax Company is a French-based global fibre producer that produces hemp fibre, a sustainable fibre currently used in denim manufacturing. A representative of the company, Herve Denoyelle, told New Age that they have been doing business with Bangladesh for the last six years and supply natural plant-based hemp fibre for the denim sector. ‘We have more than ten buyers in Bangladesh and in the last year, we shipped 100 tons of fibre to our supplier,’ he added. The demand for hemp fibre is growing in Bangladesh as Western buyers demand natural and sustainable products. Moreover, he added that the price of items produced from plant-based fibre is also high. He said that people need clothing as a fundamental right regarding the US tariffs. Moreover, China, Vietnam and even India are becoming more expensive. He also said that the buyers are moving towards recycling and sustainable products. Deyao Textile produces about 90 million yards of denim fabric yearly at its Foshan City factory in China. Robert Deakin, director (sales) of the company, told New Age that they export around 10 per cent of their total exporting products to Bangladeshi manufacturers as per the nomination of Western buyers. He also said that they exported fabric to prominent Bangladeshi manufacturers, such as Ha-meem Group, Sharmin Group, and Standard Group. Regarding the US tariff, he said that a number of big manufacturers were considering relocating their plants to Bangladesh, Cambodia, or Vietnam. However, he said that Bangladesh will remain competitive, but the country must be cautious and focus on lead time and other factors. Soko Chemical is a fashion chemical company based in Florence, Italy, that supplies chemicals to Bangladesh’s denim sector. Matteo A. Urbini, the company›s managing director, told New Age that their sustainable chemical improves the efficiency of the denim. ‘We supply washing technology to the denim sector while the usage of amount of water reduce significantly. We can transfer water into gel as per our hydrogel technology, by which we can reduce use of water to 8 litre for per kg denim, which is 80 litre in conventional,’ he added. They have more than 60 customers in Bangladesh who use their water technology. He said they still have nothing to say about the tariff, but people must wear clothes to keep Bangladesh competitive. This year’s denim expo saw 57 exhibitors from 13 countries, including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, China, Turkey, Spain, Italy, Vietnam, UAE, Germany, Switzerland, and the USA. Mostafiz Uddin, Founder and CEO of Bangladesh Denim Expo, said that the focus of negotiation on US trade issues should be the industry’s steady progress towards skill development, sustainability and innovation.

According to the country-wise detailed export data of the Export Promotion Bureau and compiled by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $32.64 billion in July-April of FY25, a moderate increase of 10 per cent, from $29.67 billion in the mentioned period of FY24. Apparel exporters said that due to the growing demands of brands and retailers, export earnings maintained a growth momentum for the past months despite the political upheaval. According to EPB data, in the July-April period of FY25, Bangladesh shipped RMG items worth $16.25 billion to the European Union countries, Bangladeshi manufacturers› largest market. This is 10.55 per cent higher than the $14.70 billion earned in the same period of FY24. The export earnings from the EU covered 49.78 per cent of the total earnings. With a robust growth rate of 15.75 per cent in the US market, Bangladesh generated $6.22 billion in the first ten months of FY25, which was higher than the $5.38 billion generated in the July-April period of FY24. The earnings from the North American country accounted for 19.09 per cent of the total revenue. EPB data show that RMG export earnings from the UK witnessed a narrow positive growth of 3.41 per cent to $3.63 billion, compared to $3.5 billion in the July-April period of FY24. Bangladeshi RMG exporters shipped apparel items worth $1.05 billion in July-April of FY25, 13.86 per cent higher than the $924.7 million earned in the same period of FY24. Among the EU countries, Germany remained Bangladesh›s largest export destination, from which the RMG manufacturers bagged $4.08 billion in July-April of FY25. Followed by Germany, the export earnings from Spain stood at $2.85 billion, France at $1.78 billion, Netherlands at $1.72 billion, Poland at $1.37 billion, and Italy at $1.27 billion, the EPB data stated. Regarding apparel exports, countries like the US, Canada, the UK, and the EU are considered traditional markets, while other countries are deemed non-traditional. Japan, Australia, Russia, India, China, South Korea, UAE, Malaysia, Brazil, and Mexico are major non-traditional export destinations. Export earnings from the nontraditional market also experienced positive growth, with an overall rise of 6.25 per cent to $5.48 billion, up from $5.16 billion in the FY24 period. The nontraditional market represented 16.79 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports. Japan led these markets with imports worth $1.02 billion from Bangladesh, followed by Australia $688.23 million and India worth $563.81 million. Moreover, RMG exports to Turkey and South Korea also witnessed significant earnings, amounting to $387.46 million and $369.70 million, respectively. According to the EPB data, the export earnings from almost all major destinations witnessed a double-digit growth rate during July-April. Faruque Hassan, former president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the RMG sector witnessed moderate growth from July to April. ‘However, due to the US tariff fear, there was sluggishness in the orders in past few weeks. So, export may witness a negative growth in the coming months for Bangladesh and other major suppliers,’ he added. He also said the government should work on the new US tariff through negotiations and diplomatic channels. Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the BGMEA, told New Age that the ongoing global trade conflicts also present new opportunities for Bangladesh to explore. ‘In this regard, we should focus more on non-traditional markets, product diversifying and other innovations,’ he added. In FY24, Bangladesh earned $38.48 billion by exporting RMG items to its global destinations.

In May, Gazipur-based Tasniah Fabrics Limited (admin building) achieved a platinum certificate from the USGBC under LEED O+M: Existing Building v4 rating system with a score of 107. The score made the factory the highest rated LEED-certified green factory in the world. Earlier, the position was held by another Bangladeshi factory, SM Sourcing Ltd, which has the score of 106. Another Gazipur-based factory, Tasniah Fabrics (RMG building), also obtained a platinum certificate from the USGBC with a score of 106 under LEED O+M: Existing Building v4 in the same month. Confit Golden Leaf, a Dhaka-based factory, obtained a platinum certificate from the USGBC under LEED O+M: Existing Building v4.1 rating system with a score of 82. So far, 66 of the world’s top 100 LEED factories, including nine of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20, are in Bangladesh. This success is expected to attract new investment and partnerships, reinforcing Bangladesh’s position as a sustainable manufacturing hub. According to industry insiders, a total of 550 factories were awaiting the USGBC’s LEED certification. The factories of Bangladesh have been obtaining the LEED certificate since 2011. The USGBC honours factories based on several criteria: transformation performance, energy, water and waste management. The best performers are rated platinum, followed by gold and silver. According to industry insiders, these criteria help green factories significantly reduce operational costs over time, even though they may initially cost more to set up. Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel said that as the world increasingly prioritised ESG performance and sustainability in supply chains, this milestone enhanced the country’s global image.

{"title": "New Age | Knitwear exporters in Bangladesh grapple to get dues from Russian buyers", "body": "More than two dozen Bangladeshi apparel exporters are still grappling with a deepening payment crisis, due to over $7 million in overdue payments from the Russian buyer, Concept Group LLC. The payment delays were largely the result of international banking restrictions imposed on Russia following Western sanctions. According to the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Russian buyers imported apparel items from more than two dozen Bangladeshi apparel manufacturers through eight buying houses. However, the Russian buyers couldn’t make the payment against the imports due to international sanctions. To break the payment deadlock, an industry leader under BKMEA proposed using Bangladesh’s pending payments for the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant as a reciprocal mechanism to recover the stalled export earnings. In this regard, they also discussed the matter with the Economic Relations Division of the finance ministry. BKMEA also said that several buying agents, including Adroit Sourcing, Mother Corporation, P2ZS Apparels Ltd and Zara Fashion, still await payment for garment shipments under a master contract with Concept Group. Mohammad Hatem, president of the BKMEA, told New Age that several buying agents have complained about overdue payments under a $70.2 million master contract. Some payments were delayed by over 120 days and, in some cases, more than a year, despite timely shipments by Bangladeshi exporters. The international sanctions on Russia have disconnected Russian banks from the SWIFT payment network, making it almost impossible for Russian buyers to transfer payments in US dollars. As a result, Bangladeshi exporters, particularly those supplying under a master contract with Concept Group, cannot recover their export earnings from the Russian buyers. On the other hand, the Bangladesh government also cannot transfer its payments to Russia for the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant — the country’s largest ongoing infrastructure project. Recognising this overlap, BKMEA has put forward a proposal to link the two payment streams. Mohammad Hatem said the government could transfer the funds allocated for the Rooppur project into an account controlled by BKMEA or another designated national mechanism. Russian buyers, including Concept Group, would then be instructed to pay the equivalent RMG export dues directly to the Russian government. He said this approach would, in effect, allow Bangladesh to offset its blocked project payments by recovering its frozen export earnings. ‘We have already raised the matter with the Bangladesh Bank governor and the secretary of the Economic Relations Division,’ Hatem said. The ERD took the matter into cognizance, he added. He explained that the mechanism would serve two purposes, including allowing them to recover the $7 million owed to the exporters, which is critical for their survival. Secondly, it would help the government release its stalled project payments, avoiding further delays to the Rooppur project. Hatem said that if the mechanism is successful, it could establish a ‘barter system’ channel that could serve the long-term bilateral trade between Bangladesh and Russia. Hatem also said that Russian buyers could deposit payments in rubles, yuan, or other alternative currencies under the proposed arrangement. At the same time, Bangladesh would clear its sovereign obligations without violating international sanctions. On April 30, the BKMEA president formally wrote to the Russian buyer, Concept Group Brand Director Evgeniya, seeking urgent action to resolve outstanding payments. The association urged the buyer to explore alternative payment methods, including using rubles or yuan, third-country banks or a barter system, which could be the most practical mechanism under current sanctions. Meanwhile, after sending the letters, Hatem said a payment of $12,000 he received as arrears for one of his companies. Himalay Sourcing Ltd managing director Morshed Bakul said that that his banks are increasing their pressure for payment as he failed to recover about $342 thousand from the Russian buyer. ‘If the barter system works, we will welcome it as we need the payment by anyhow, otherwise we will fall under serious cash shortfall,’ he added.

They were speaking at a meet the press event, organised by the Parishad on Thursday in the capital. The biennial election of the BGMEA for the 2025-27 tenure is scheduled to be held on May 31. Kazi Maniruzzaman, president of the Sammilita Parishad panel, said that if they can succeed in forming the board, the era of shameless flattery within trade bodies will be ended forever. ‘During the previous government, not only BGMEA but almost all trade bodies in the country turned into political party strongholds. We are determined to close that chapter for good,’ he added. Md Abul Kalam, panel leader of the Sammilita Parishad, said that the global trade system is facing significant challenges, particularly due to the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US administration and other economic issues. Moreover, a set of domestic issues including rising fuel prices, gas shortages, complexities related to customs, bonds, and banking, along with the LDC graduation plan, may further intensify the challenges. ‘In this regard, if we can form the board, we will advocate for industry-friendly policy support from the government and to sustain continuous export growth by navigating the arove issues,’ he added. He also said that Sammilita Parishad will work for the digital transformation of the BGMEA, training for new entrepreneurs, sustainable planning for SME factories, and to bring back the weak and closed factories in the operations.

{"title": "New Age | Apparel exports to EU surge by 33pc", "body": "Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the European Union showed a strong upward trend in the first quarter (January-March) of 2025, with total earnings increasing by 33 per cent compared to the same period in 2024. According to data from the Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, From January to March 2025, EU apparel imports from Bangladesh totalled 5.68 billion euros, compared to 4.27 billion euros during the same period in 2024. This increase of 1.41 billion euros in the quarter represents a notable 33 per cent growth in terms of value. Knitwear exports drove much of this expansion, climbing nearly 36 per cent from around 2.39 billion euros to 3.25 billion euros. Woven apparel also performed strongly, with exports rising approximately 30 per cent from 1.87 billion euros to 2.43 billion euros. Exporters attributed the recent surge in apparel exports to the EU to seasonal summer demand, early order placements by buyers and a recovering European market. Although Bangladesh’s exports to the EU grew year-on-year in each of the three months, the rate of growth slowed gradually over the quarter. Data showed that Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the EU in January 2025 posted the highest growth rate at 61 per cent, reaching 1.91 billion euros, followed by slower but healthy growth of 28 per cent in February with 1.66 billion euros and a further slowdown to 18 per cent growth in March with exports totaling 2.10 billion euros. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association former president Fazlul Hoque said that the significant increase in the EU’s overall apparel imports in the first quarter of 2025 indicated a clear revival of the market. ‘The good news is that buyers are placing orders again — and the even better news is that a significant share of those orders is coming to Bangladesh. It shows that we are holding our ground, even as competition intensifies,’ he said. The EU market saw strong growth in apparel imports in the first quarter of 2025, with total import value rising 20.6 per cent from approximately 19.44 billion euros in January-March of 2024 to 23.45 billion euros in the same period in 2025. Knit apparel imports increased by 23.6 per cent, rising from 9.53 billion euros to 11.78 billion euros, while woven apparel imports grew 18 per cent, from 9.90 billion euros to 11.67 billion euros. Overall, EU apparel imports rose by more than 4.9 billion euros year-on-year. In volume terms, the EU’s apparel imports also recorded a significant increase. Total import volume reached approximately 11.51 million kilograms in the first quarter of 2025, up from 9.57 million kilograms in the same period of 2024, a 20.3 per cent rise. In quantity, Bangladesh’s total apparel exports to the EU rose from 2.90 million kilograms in the first quarter of 2024 to 3.61 million kilograms in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 24.6 per cent. Knitwear volumes grew by 29.5 per cent, from 1.76 million kilograms to 2.28 million kilograms while woven apparel exports increased by 17.1 per cent, reaching 1.33 million kilograms. Among major EU suppliers, Bangladesh recorded one of the highest growth rates in value terms, surpassing key competitors such as China, Vietnam, Turkey, and India. While it fell just short of Cambodia’s exceptionally high growth rate, it remained slightly ahead of Pakistan’s. Despite the positive export trends, Fazlul Hoque cautioned that supply-side risks were mounting, particularly due to energy shortages. He said that plans to divert gas from power generation could create significant energy supply challenges for the industry, potentially threatening Bangladesh’s ability to sustain or grow its market share. Eurostat data showed that China retained its position as the EU’s largest apparel supplier by value. The country’s exports rose from 4.92 billion euros in the first quarter of 2024 to 6.35 billion euros in the same period of 2025, marking a 29 per cent increase. Knitwear shipments to the EU grew by 32.7 per cent, while woven apparel rose by 25.5 per cent. Turkey saw a slight decline in total apparel exports, which fell by 0.9 per cent from 2.28 billion euros to 2.26 billion euros. While knit exports rose marginally by 1.5 per cent, woven apparel declined by 4.1 per cent, possibly reflecting changing competitiveness or supply chain dynamics. India achieved solid growth, with EU imports rising from 1.07 billion euros to 1.37 billion euros, a 27.8 per cent increase. Knitwear grew by 34 per cent and woven by 22 per cent, indicating a broader improvement in India’s access to the EU market. Vietnam’s apparel exports to the EU expanded by 22 per cent to 1.08 billion euros, supported by a 19 per cent rise in knitwear and a 24 per cent increase in woven apparel. Pakistan recorded a 32.8 per cent rise in total exports, which reached 1.03 billion euros. Knitwear exports increased by 30 per cent, while woven apparel grew by 36 per cent. Cambodia reported the fastest growth among all listed suppliers, with EU apparel imports rising by 37.8 per cent to 1.11 billion euros. Knitwear exports grew by 35 per cent, and woven garments surged by 41 per cent.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh to stay as top cotton importer in 2025-26", "body": "USDA says Bangladesh, the second largest exporter of readymade garment items, is poised to remain the world’s largest raw cotton importer in the marketing year 2025-26, said the US Department of Agriculture. According to the data titled ‘Cotton: World Markets and Trade’ issued by the Foreign Agricultural Service under USDA, Bangladesh is projected to import 8.5 million bales of cotton in MY26, which starts in August. USDA data show that in MY24, Bangladesh imported about 7.5 million bales of cotton from its global sources, which may increase to 8.2 million bales at the end of the current MY25. Vietnam, one of the closest competitors of Bangladesh in the RMG export, is projected to import 8 million bales of cotton in MY26, where China may import 7 million bales, which imported 15 million bales in MY24. However, Bangladesh remained top cotton importers, with 7 million bales import in MY23, and 8.45 million bales in MY22. Meanwhile, on March 31, the USDA, in its report titled ‘Cotton and Products Annual,’ stated that Bangladesh’s cotton imports would witness a slight increase in MY26 thanks to increasing demand for RMG items. According to the Export Promotion Bureau data, in the July-April period of the current FY25, Bangladesh’s RMG exports witnessed a positive growth of 10.86 per cent year-on-year to $30.25 billion. In MY24, West African cotton held the largest market share in Bangladesh (37 per cent), while other major exporters included Brazil (17 per cent), India (23 per cent), and the United States (9 per cent). US cotton growers and exporters tried to expand their exports to Bangladesh for years. It is to be noted that in early April, the US administration announced hefty duties on multiple countries as part of sweeping global tariffs, and Bangladesh was also slapped with a 37 per cent reciprocal tariff. Currently, most Bangladeshi goods in the US face a 15 per cent tariff. However, after a few days, the US administration paused the declared tariff for a 90-day period. A number of exporters and experts suggested raising the import of US cotton to reduce the trade gap between Bangladesh and the US. On 2023, Bangladesh lifted the double fumigation requirement for US cotton, meant US cotton could enter Bangladesh without fumigation at the port of entry, which saved importers millions of dollars and five days of waiting time. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), said Bangladesh could import more cotton from the US as a part of a broader strategy to reduce the trade gap between the two countries. He said that the USDA’s import forecast strongly ratifies Bangladesh’s capability to maintain and expand its leadership in the global RMG value chain. He also said that importing a large amount of cotton from the US may reinforce Bangladesh’s position for bargaining for duty-free access for its RMG items to the US. He also said that the government’s position in this regard is appreciable. He added that cotton will always remain vital as a crucial raw material for Bangladesh’s spinners and knitwear producers as a primary source of natural and sustainable fibre. According to the USDA, Bangladeshi producers could produce about 153,000 bales of cotton on 45,000 hectares of land, which is less than 2 per cent of its total consumption.

The adviser said this after a meeting with chief of different agencies at the shipping ministry on Wednesday to ensure safety and security of the passengers to travel on waterways ahead of the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha. Eid-ul-Azha, one of the biggest religious festivals of the Muslims, will be celebrated in the country in the first week of June. ‘The owners of the RMG factories must pay outstanding salary and allowances of the workers, otherwise they have to go behind the bar,’ Sakhawat said. ‘Arrest warrant has already been issued against five apparel factory owners. So, they cannot go outside Dhaka, going abroad is a far cry,’ he said. In that meeting, Sakhawat said that the garment owners made the commitment to pay the outstanding salaries of the workers at any cost, even if selling their homes, by May 28. He said that the commitment of the RMG factory owners had made us hopeful. ‘So, we think that the garment owners will pay the salaries and allowances of the workers as they promised. There is no scope to do otherwise,’ he said. ‘Those who are unable to pay the salaries of the workers, they should not be the owners of the RMG units,’ he said. The adviser observed that some of the RMG owners had set up factories for showing fashion. It should not be allowed in future, he added.

However, the sector’s manufacturers said they were intensively monitoring the risky factories and would take adequate measures if necessary, according to the Industrial Police. According to the Industrial Police data, there are 198 risky factories, 69 of which are members of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association and 22 of which are members of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Moreover, 12 risky factories are from various EPZs under the Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority, and 71 factory units are not affiliated with any of the mentioned authorities or bodies. Talking to New Age, Md Saiful Haque, superintendent of police (intelligence) of the Industrial Police, said they had completed a primary list of the risky factories ahead of Eid. ‘However, the number of the factories may vary in the final list. So far, about 198 factories are at risk of not paying wages and bonuses in time to their workers at major eight industrial hubs and export processing zones,’ he added. He also said that their intelligent wing is working with their son so that they can pay the wages and constantly surveil the risky factories along with others. According to a source from the BGMEA, as of Saturday, only two of the 2,092 active factories across the country under the BGMEA were closed. The data also showed that as of Saturday, 38 BGMEA factories had yet to pay their April wages, and two still had not paid March wages. Moreover, 266 factories have already paid their festival allowances for the upcoming Eid al-Azha. Talking to New Age, Mohammad Hatem, president of the BKMEA, said that businesses were under pressure due to the banks› complete non-cooperation. ‘Banks are not assisting us as we cannot open LC and they don’t pay us money for the wages which accelerated the crises in some factory units,’ he added. Moreover, due to the disruption in export activities and the interruption in gas and electricity supply, the factories are having difficulties running their normal activities. He also said that the BKMEA had 20-22 risky members and was working on closely monitoring these factories. ‘We have scheduled a meeting on Sunday (May 25) with some risky RMG factories. We will hear their problems and will take necessary steps as per the discussion,’ he added. Amirul Haque Amin, president of the National Garment Workers Federation, told New Age that the concerned authorities must take action against risky factories. ‘We are also monitoring the risky factories with our limited resources and technology. The number might be more than 200,’ he added. He also said that, as long as there is still time, they hope the number will be lowered. ‘We urge the labour ministry, BGMEA, BKMEA, Industrial Police, Bangladesh Army and other concerned agencies to take immediate actions so that those factories can get out of the risky status,’ he added. He added that the concerned trade bodies and law enforcement agencies should strictly monitor the situation so that the workers are paid their wages and allowances before Eid. He also warned that if the workers are not paid, they will report to the connected buyers about the factory units.

{"title": "New Age | Road map sought to turn leather sector as next pillar of export", "body": "Speakers at a seminar today put emphasis on creating an integrated roadmap to turn the leather sector as the next pillar of export growth. They also underscored the need for ensuring compliance and international certification to tap the potentials in the export growth of leather goods. They made such observations at a seminar on ‘Sustainable Export Growth in Post LDC Era: Strategies for the Leather Sector’ held today at the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the capital. Speaking at the seminar as the chief guest, Industries Adviser Adilur Rahman Khan said international certification is crucial for the competitiveness of the leather sector as the buyers offer lower price to the exporters lacking environmental certification. ‘At present we’ve only three Leather Working Group certified tanneries in Bangladesh. Recognizing these realities, the Ministry of Industries is working to create a supportive policy environment that can enable long-term transformation,’ he said. He remarked that Bangladesh’s leather industry must move beyond competing on price to capture a larger share of the US$420 billion global leather goods market. Regarding capacity building of CETP at Savar Tannery Park, Adilur requested the tannery owners to establish ETP of their own since the government is currently allowing it. He said the government would play a catalytic role by creating a broad ecosystem along with the industry players, private investors and development partners. The Industries Adviser also urged the tannery owners to be more careful about the climate, environment and rivers as because at the end of the day all would have to save the environment. Md Hafizur Rahman, administrator of FBCCI, said that inbound foreign investment in the leather sector is low due to lack of LWG certification while on the other side entrepreneurs are being deprived of getting good prices for their products. He also expressed his thoughts in favour of the Central Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), because it is easy to operate as well as bearing the cost of CETP collectively while it is also easy to monitor single. ‘If the industry players can maintain the environmental, social, and governance compliance, it will be easier to get LWG certificates and it will help attract Foreign Direct Investment, because we’ve a lot of low cost raw materials here,’ he added. The FBCCI administrator said Bangladesh’s leather sector and other promising export-oriented sectors should get the same treatment as the Ready-Made Garments is having now. He also hoped that in the next budget, the government would allow all to have the bonded warehouse facility. Md Saiful Islam, chairman of Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC), said the issue of CETP is the most important in the leather sector. He said the capacity of the CETP installed at Savar is currently 14,000 cubic meters while the demand during the peak season is 32,000 to 35,000 cubic meters. ‘A technical team is working to increase the capacity of the CETP, so it can be increased up to 20,000 to 25,000 cubic meters,’ he added. He said initially six institutions have been given permission to establish ETP of their own, while another eight to 10 tanneries are in the process of getting approval. Saiful also urged the entrepreneurs to adhere to compliance to prevent environmental pollution. Since the country lacks LWG certified tanneries, he therefore emphasized exploring new export destinations, product innovation and use of modern technology in the leather sector. DCCI President Taskeen Ahmed said the leather sector, the second-highest export earner after RMG, has potential for value addition, employment generation and sustainable industrial growth particularly in the post-LDC era when preferential trade benefits may gradually phase out. To ensure a sustainable export growth in post-LDC era, he recommended for green transformation of tanneries, skills development, improved value chain, strong backward linkage, exploring new export destinations and public-private collaboration with a view to make this sector a pillar of the country’s sustainable export item. While presenting the keynote paper, Syed Nasim Manzur, managing director of Apex Footwear Ltd, said it has been many years since the tanneries have been shifted from Hazaribagh to Savar, but the CETP is yet to be operationalised fully which is also hampering the export growth. He showed that the leather industry’s annual exports are hovering around $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion, but with incentives and policy support like the readymade garment sector avails, it will be able to export $5 billion annually by 2030 and thus increase it to $10 billion by 2035. Nasim also urged the government to help small entrepreneurs of the leather sector so that they can avail low cost financial assistance from the Climate Finance Fund.

{"title": "New Age | Textile mills gasp from severe disruption in gas supply", "body": "Textile and garment industry owners said that due to the inadequate supply of gas, the normal manufacturing activities is being hampered in the industry. Moreover, a number of textile mills are on the verge of shutting down as they are unable to operate even at minimum capacity. They were speaking at a press conference organised by the Bangladesh Textile Mill Association in the capital on Sunday. Representatives from Federation of Bangladesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh Terry Towel and Linen Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Leathergoods and Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association of Bangladesh, and Bangladesh Chamber of Industries were also present at the event. BTMA president Showkat Aziz Russell said that the sector was going through a gas supply shortage for the past few months, and it became severe in the last few weeks. He also said that the government was reluctant to resolve the crises and the sector was passing through a hard time. ‘The government seems like ostrich, everyone is saying about their problems but they hide their head in the sands,’ he added. He also said that the factories are being strangled to death through anti-industry actions and the working capital has shrunk drastically. ‘It seems that we cannot pay wages and festival allowances properly before Eid and we won’t be able to reopen the factories after Eid,’ he added. He also said that in 1971, intellectuals were systematically targeted and killed. In 2025, the industry and the industrialists are being targeted destroyed, he added. He also said that the failure to save the industry could lead the country towards famine. He sought immediate governmental measures to ensure smooth and uninterrupted gas supply to the textile industries of the country. ‘The government has failed to provide adequate gas supply to the industries despite hike in the prices several time and repeated commitments,’ he added. But, the government is now setting a deadline for the factories to pay wages, otherwise, the owners will be arrested, and their houses and cars will be sold, he lamented. ‘Government should introduce a mid-term strategy and roadmap to resolve the gas and energy issues,’ he added. He also said that there was about 20 per cent system loss in Titas Gas, though the global standard is 1 per cent to 2 per cent. ‘If the government take immediate measures to stop system loss, it would be lowered to 7 per cent to 8 per cent,’ he added. BCI president Anwar Ul Alam Chowdhury said that the government committed to provide required mmcf of gas, but they couldn’t supply. The government has hiked gas price, interest rates for which factories run only 60 per cent of their capacity. Jakir Hossain Noyon, member of the assistant committee of the FBCCI, said that government must focus on exploring new gas field to meet the demands. He also urged the government to start Small Modular Reactor technology for the industry. BTMA director Rajeev Haidar also urged to drill new gas field. BTMA vice-president Saleudh Zaman Khan said that if the government did not take proper action, Bangladesh would not see the birth of new entrepreneurs. ‘If the government couldn’t solve the problems by June, a number of factories will shut after the Eid,’ he added. Business leaders from many other trade bodies also spoke at the event.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh now has 244 green RMG factories", "body": "Now Bangladesh has 244 readymade garment factories certified by the United States Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design authorities as another unit achieved status of green factory. Of the 244 green factories, 102 are platinum-rated, 128 gold-rated, 10 silver-rated and four certified factories, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. In May, Gazipur-based Esprit Apparels Ltd achieved a platinum certificate from the USGBC under LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system with a score of 101. So far, 68 of the world’s top 100 LEED factories, including nine of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20, are in Bangladesh. This success is expected to attract new investment and partnerships, reinforcing Bangladesh’s position as a sustainable manufacturing hub. According to industry insiders, a total of 550 factories were awaiting the USGBC’s LEED certification. The factories of Bangladesh have been obtaining the LEED certificate since 2011. The USGBC honours factories based on several criteria: transformation performance, energy, water and waste management. The best performers are rated platinum, followed by gold and silver. According to industry insiders, these criteria help green factories significantly reduce operational costs over time, even though they may initially cost more to set up. Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel said that as the world increasingly prioritised ESG performance and sustainability in supply chains, this milestone enhanced the country’s global image. According to apparel manufacturers, the move towards green factory buildings helped regain Bangladesh›s image after the Rana Plaza tragedy, which claimed 1,134 lives and left more than 2,000 injured.

The RMG sector, accounting for 84 per cent of exports, is under pressure from global challenges, including US tariffs, India’s transshipment suspension, high bank interest rates, and utility price hikes. In this context, BGMEA appreciated the decision to keep source tax and corporate tax for exporters unchanged. Moreover, they also applauded several reforms simplifying the bond and customs system, such as extended general bond renewal terms, revised penalties, and tariff exemptions for key machinery for EPZs.

During the first four months of 2025, Bangladesh outpaced its major competitors in terms of export growth rates. In January-April of 2025, the North American country’s RMG imports from its global suppliers also witnessed a positive growth of 10.67 per cent to $26.21 billion, compared with those of $23.7 billion in the same period of 2024.

As the third-largest supplier to the US, Bangladesh’s market share in the North American country stood at 9.80 per cent as of April 2025. Amid the ongoing trade war between the US and China, Vietnam surpassed China as the top exporter to the US in March 2025, which it maintained in April. In the January-April period, Vietnam remained the top RMG exporter to the US market. With a positive growth of 16.08 per cent, the East Asian country exported apparel items worth $5.09 billion, surpassing the $4.38 billion recorded in the same period of 2024. Vietnam held a market share of 19.18 per cent. The OTEXA data stated that China exported apparel items worth $4.35 billion in the reporting period, representing a 0.6 per cent increase from $4.33 billion in the same period of 2024, and claiming a market share of 20.23 per cent.

However, the country’s RMG manufacturers are still concerned about the US’ 37-per cent tariff imposition on all Bangladeshi exporting products, though it has been paused for 90 days. They stated that the 90-day pause was not a permanent or sustainable solution and the government should take immediate action through diplomatic channels to resolve the issue before the 90-day period ends. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the country must narrow trade imbalance to protect exporters from the US tariff. However, he said, the abnormal imposition of tariffs on Chinese products accelerated the shifting of work orders to Bangladesh, which in turn impacted US exports.

China, which maintained its lead with 7.88 billion euros in apparel exports to the EU in the first four months of 2025, posted a growth of 23.5 per cent, over the same period, according to the Eurostat data released on Friday. Cambodia, Pakistan, India, and Vietnam also recorded double-digit growth, while Turkey was the only major country to register a decline. The month-wise breakdown for Bangladesh highlighted an especially strong start to the year. In January, Bangladesh’s readymade garment exports to the EU surged by 60.9 per cent year-on-year to 1.91 billion euros, up from 1.19 billion euros in 2024. The growth rate slowed slightly in the following months but remained robust—28.0 per cent in February, 18.6 per cent in March, and 6.0 per cent in April. Exporters attributed the strong status in January to order spillovers since late 2024, early-season buying by European retailers, and efforts to front-load shipments ahead of anticipated logistical or market uncertainties. Overall, EU apparel imports grew by 15.7 per cent in the January–April 2025 period, reaching 30.42 billion euros compared with 26.29 billion euros a year earlier. Bangladesh and China together contributed more than 70 per cent of the total increase in EU apparel imports. EU apparel imports from China rose 23.5 per cent in January–April 2025 to 7.88 billion euros, up from 6.38 billion euros in the same period of 2024. In contrast, Turkey’s apparel exports to the EU declined by 4.0 per cent, falling from 3.03 billion euros in the first four months of 2024 to 2.91 billion euros in the same period of 2025. India’s apparel exports to the EU grew 21.5 per cent in January–April 2025, reaching 1.87 billion euros compared with 1.54 billion euros in 2024. Vietnam saw a 17.3 per cent rise in apparel exports to the EU during the same period, increasing to 1.38 billion euros from 1.18 billion euros the previous year.

Including the four, Bangladesh now has a total of 248 green factories. Of them, 105 are platinum-rated, 129 are gold-rated, 10 are silver-rated, and four are certified factories, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. In June, Manikganj-based Advance Attire Limited achieved a platinum certificate from the USGBC under LEED BD+C: New Construction v3 rating system with a score of 96. Narsingdi-based Amanat Shah Fabrics Ltd – Woven Composite also obtained a platinum certificate under LEED O+M: Existing Building v4 rating system with a score of 82. Cotton Field BD Ltd – Production Building, a Gazipur-based factory unit, achieved platinum certificate with a score of 83 under LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system. Moreover, KM Apparel Knit (Pvt) Limited, a Dhaka-based factory, obtained a gold certificate under LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system, said the BGMEA data. So far, 68 of the world’s top 100 LEED factories, including nine of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20, are in Bangladesh. This success is expected to attract new investment and partnerships, reinforcing Bangladesh’s position as a sustainable manufacturing hub. According to industry insiders, a total of 550 Bangladeshi factories were awaiting the USGBC’s LEED certification. The factories of Bangladesh have been obtaining the LEED certificate since 2011. The USGBC honours factories based on several criteria: transformation performance, energy, water and waste management. The best performers are rated platinum, followed by gold and silver. According to industry insiders, these criteria help green factories significantly reduce operational costs over time, even though they may initially spend more for the set up. Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel said that as the world increasingly prioritised ESG performance and sustainability in supply chains, this milestone enhanced the country’s global image. According to apparel manufacturers, the move towards green factory buildings helped regain Bangladesh’s image after the Rana Plaza tragedy, which claimed 1,134 lives and left more than 2,000 injured.

{"title": "New Age | Apparel exports to major markets rise in July-May", "body": "The export of the readymade garment items from Bangladesh to its major destinations, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, witnessed a considerable growth in the eleven months or July-May period of the current financial year 2024-25 amid tariff issues. According to country-wise detailed export data of the Export Promotion Bureau, compiled by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $36.56 billion in July-May of FY25, a moderate increase of 10.30 per cent, from $33.17 billion in the corresponding period of FY24. Apparel exporters said that, due to growing demands of brands and retailers and a shift in orders from China, export earnings had maintained a growth momentum for the past few months, despite ongoing tariff issues and political transition in the country. According to the EPB data, in the July-May period of FY25, fetching a positive growth of 10.46 per cent, Bangladesh shipped RMG items worth $18.25 billion to European Union countries, higher than that of $16.19 billion in the same period of FY24. The export earnings from the EU covered 49.91 per cent of the total revenue. Bangladesh bagged $7.31 billion from the US, the single largest destination of Bangladeshi exporters, in the first eleven months of FY25, which was robust 15.97 per cent higher than that of $6.06 billion earned in the July-May period of FY24. The earnings from the North American country accounted for 19.23 per cent of the total revenue. Fetching a narrow growth of 3.96 per cent, Bangladesh earned $4.03 billion from the UK in the July-May period of FY25, which was $3.88 billion in the same period of FY24, the EPB data stated. Bangladeshi RMG exporters shipped apparel items worth $1.2 billion to Canada in July-May of FY25, 14.14 per cent higher than the $1.05 billion earned in the same period of FY24. Among the EU countries, Germany remained Bangladesh’s largest export destination, from which the RMG manufacturers of the country bagged $4.58 billion in July-May of FY25, said the EPB data. Following Germany, the export earnings from Spain stood at $3.16 billion, that of France at $2 billion, the Netherlands at $1.93 billion, Poland at $1.56 billion and Italy at $1.43 billion, with positive growth maintained at every destination. Regarding apparel exports, countries like the US, Canada, the UK and the EU are considered traditional markets, while other countries are deemed non-traditional. Japan, Australia, Russia, India, China, South Korea, the UAE, Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico are major non-traditional export destinations. Export earnings from the non-traditional markets also experienced positive growth, with an overall rise of 6.79 per cent to $6.04 billion, up from $5.65 billion in the same period of FY24. The non-traditional market represented 16.53 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports. In July-May period of FY25, Japan led these markets with imports worth $1.11 billion from Bangladesh, followed by Australia $759.16 million and India $604.78 million. Moreover, RMG exports to Turkey and South Korea also witnessed significant earnings, amounting to $430.94 million and $396.03 million respectively. According to the EPB data, export earnings from almost all major destinations experienced a double-digit growth rate from July to May. Speaking to New Age, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the BGMEA, stated that over the past few months, Bangladesh had witnessed a rise in purchase orders. ‘A considerable number of orders started to shift from China to Bangladesh due to US tariff. Moreover, some Chinese manufacturers shifted their offices to Dhaka and hired factories, which impacted the growth,’ he added. He stated that buyers consistently trusted Bangladesh due to its ethical production practices. ‘We have opportunity to raise our share in the global RMG markets from our existing share of about 7 per cent. In this regard, the government has to support us with uninterrupted gas, electricity and adequate policy,’ he added. Regarding the US tariff issue, he said that the 90-day pause was approaching its end, but Bangladesh was delaying in taking action. ‘Our government should act soon as most of our competitors are working in it,’ he added. Regarding the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, he said that Bangladeshi oil and LNG imports might be hampered if the Hormuz Strait got closed. ‘Our government should think about alternative sources for importing LNG beyond Qatar,’ he added. Mohiuddin Rubel, former BGMEA director, told New Age that the ongoing global trade conflicts also presented new opportunities for Bangladesh to explore. ‘In this regard, we should focus more on non-traditional markets, product diversifying and other innovations,’ he added. In FY24, Bangladesh earned $38.48 billion by exporting RMG items to its global destinations.

PRAN-RFL Group, one of the country’s leading business conglomerates, earlier this year re-launched the state-owned Rajshahi Textile Mills as ‘Barendra Rajshahi Textile Limited’ after about 25 years of closure under a public-private partnership with BTMC. Led by PPP chief executive officer Muhammad Rafiqul Islam, the delegation, consisting of BTMC chairman Brig Gen SM Zahid Hassan and BTMC’s PPP project director Kazi Firoj Hassan, also joined a workshop hosted by BTMC for investors. Barendra Rajshahi Textile Mills Limited chairman Shahidul Islam and executive director of Multiline Industries Limited Anisur Rahman were present on the occasion. Shahidul Islam told BSS that they want to turn this factory, located on around 26 acres of land at the Nawdapara area of the city, into the largest environment-friendly industrial enterprise in the country’s northwest region. The factory will be 100 percent export-oriented. Various bags, shoes and ready-made garments will be manufactured here. Additionally, a modern call centre will be established soon. A Taka 350-crore investment plan has been undertaken aiming to employ around 12,000 people within two years. Islam said, ‘We have to come out of the Dhaka-centric perspective for the sake of overall development of the country.’ ‘That is why we have started this large industrial project in Rajshahi. Through this, thousands of people of Rajshahi will get employment opportunities and thus, the local economy will benefit from this initiative,’ he said. ‘This factory will be a fully sustainable green industrial park, which will have solar energy, green zones and water recycling systems,’ he continued. ‘We have renovated an abandoned factory shed and started small-scale production of shoes and bags, employing around 1,000 local people,’ said Anisur Rahman. Apart from this, the process of hiring another 1,000 people is underway. A ‘Skill Development Centre’ will be set up soon to enhance the skill of local workers. One of the objectives of this investment is to curb the trend towards the capital by utilizing the labor market of Rajshahi. ‘We are optimistic that if this project is successful, we will be able to move forward with larger investments and expansion in the region in the future,’ he added. At present, PRAN-RFL Group operates two factories in Rajshahi - Barendra Industrial Park and PRAN Agro Limited - employing about 1,200 people.

The report revealed, apparel imports from Bangladesh to the USA in 2015 were valued at $ 5.40 billion, rising to $ 7.34 billion by 2024, reflecting a notable 35.94 percent growth over the same period. While experiencing a positive trajectory until 2019, the emergence of Covid led to an 11.76 per cent decline in 2020 ($5.92 billion was in 2019 and $5.22 billion was in 2020). Since 2020, Bangladesh has shown impressive growth at 40.45 per cent, surpassing the USA’s growth rate of 23.72 per cent, according to the report. The OTEXA stated that in 2015, apparel imports to the USA totalled $85.16 billion, decreasing to $79.26 billion by 2024, marking a 6.94 per cent decline over the decade. The trend was consistently positive until 2019, but with the onset of Covid, a significant 23.47 per cent drop was observed in 2020 ($83.70 billion was in 2019 and $64.06 billion was in 2020). Despite the USA showing signs of recovery post-COVID, the economic downturn was substantial, failing to meet the import of 2015 even in 2024. During US recessions, consumer spending reductions notably impact clothing expenditures, reflecting broader economic shifts impacting the apparel market. With the USA retail sector heavily reliant on imports (comprising 95 percent of the industry), challenges such as high tariffs (averaging 18.5 per cent pre-Trump era), escalating freight costs, and short apparel market lifespans have hindered integration into supply chains.

{"title": "New Age | RMG, textile leaders urge easing gas permission", "body": "Leaders from the export-oriented ready-made garments and textile industries urged the government to exempt them from seeking repeated approvals from Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited for the internal reconfiguration of industrial and captive-run installations. They stated that removing the requirement for prior approvals will help the industry adopt more energy-efficient and high-performance machinery. ‘We believe this will significantly boost energy efficiency, enhance production, and contribute to valuable foreign exchange earnings,’ they added. The leaders recently made this appeal in a joint letter to Muhammad Fawzul Kabir Khan, adviser to the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. Industry leaders warned that procedural delays and restrictions in the current gas connection approval process are hindering production and costing the country valuable export earnings. The appeal — endorsed by Hossain Mehmood, president, Bangladesh Terry Towel & Linen Manufacturers & Exporters Association, Fazlee Shamim Ehsan, executive president, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers & Exporters Association, Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury (Parvez), Bangladesh Chamber of Industries, Taskeen Ahmed, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu, president, Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association and Showkat Aziz Russell, president, Bangladesh Textile Mills Association (BTMA) — highlights that RMG and textile mills are unable to operate at full capacity due to inadequate gas supply, resulting in up to 40 per cent lower production. They stated that most factories are established with BIDA’s approval and built with significant investment in infrastructure, imported machinery, and utilities, often backed by bank financing. But despite this, companies are unable to utilise their installations and meet export targets fully. Industry leaders argued that frequent restructuring or machinery replacements are required to improve efficiency or respond to changing buyer demands. However, the current requirement to seek prior approval from gas distribution companies for any rearrangement — even within factory premises — causes unnecessary delays. They proposed that gas distributors should not interfere in the internal setup of customer premises beyond the RMS (Regulating and Metering Station) room, provided that the approved load and pressure remain unchanged. Additionally, they requested the withdrawal of a previous directive requiring clearance from electricity distribution companies (e.g., Palli Bidyut) for new captive power connections above 10 MW, citing the national grid’s unreliable supply. Other key demands include allowing unused gas load from one industrial unit to be transferred to another under the same ownership and premises without reclassifying it as a new connection. They also called for permitting load transfers across different premises owned by the same company and introducing a digital application system for gas connections and meter installations, with a fixed processing timeframe of 3–5 working days. ‘Authorising regional gas offices to approve load rearrangements would avoid higher-level delays. Establishing an approved list of gas meter brands and models would also simplify procurement and reduce installation times,’ the letter read. They further sought automatic approval of low-pressure regulators in areas with chronic pressure shortfalls. The industry leaders argued that these reforms would enhance energy efficiency, facilitate the adoption of modern machinery, and ensure uninterrupted production, thereby contributing significantly to export growth and foreign exchange earnings. The letter was also copied to the adviser to the Ministry of Commerce for information and to ensure it was taken care of.

According to Export Promotion Bureau data, in FY25, the country earned $871.57 million, representing a narrow positive growth of 2.42 per cent from $851.01 million in FY24. The home textile sector was regarded as a key emerging player in the country’s export basket. As export earner, the sector touched the milestone of $1 billion for the first time in FY21 after the readymade garment, jute, and leather. In that year, the sector earned $1.13 billion, and crossed the billion club for the next FYs too, bagging $1.62 billion in FY22 and $1.09 billion in FY23. However, due to an abnormal hike in gas prices, supply interruptions, and the Ukraine-Russia war, the sector’s earnings began to fall since FY23. Following two consecutive years of negative growth, the home textile industry experienced positive growth in FY25. Since November 2024, export earnings from home textiles have bounced back, sustaining this growth throughout FY25. However, the sector again faced negative growth in June 2025, the last month of FY25. According to the EPB data, in FY25, bed, kitchen, and toilet lines generated $409.71 million, tents earned $226 million, rags and scrap twine earned $97.96 million, and the remaining $138 million came from other segments of the home textiles industry. Momtex Limited is one of the major exporters of home textile products, with 7,500 employees and a monthly production capacity of 6 million meters. Shahjada Rubel, head of business at Momtex, told New Age that exports experienced positive growth, and the factories received a substantial number of purchase orders over the years. ‘Due to a hike in duties in China, a number of Chinese companies shifted their production facilities in Bangladesh which impacted our exports’, he added. However, he said, the government must focus on ensuring the uninterrupted supply of gas and energy, as well as price reductions, to sustain export growth. Rashed Mosharraf, executive director (sales, marketing, and operations) of Zaber and Zubair Fashion Ltd, one of the country›s most prominent players in the home textile sector, told New Age that a significant number of irregular orders were cleared last year, which impacted the exports. ‘The sector did well despite the political transition, severe fuel and energy shortage, and country’s overall discipline situation,’ he added. Meanwhile, he stated that the newly imposed 2 per cent advance income tax on cotton imports would severely impact the sector. ‘If the government could provide sufficient policy supports, uninterrupted gas and electricity supply, the sector could again able to earn $1 billion, otherwise we may lose our competitiveness to Pakistan,’ he added. Industry insiders said that home textiles was one of Bangladesh’s first-line export sectors, with the ability to produce bulk products, which had also accelerated the country’s rise to global leadership. The country’s home textile export basket includes bed linen, bed sheets, and other bedroom textiles, bath linen, carpets and rugs, blankets, kitchen linen, curtains, cushions, cushion covers, and quilt covers.

{"title": "New Age | Textile millers fear losing competitiveness", "body": "ADVANCE INCOME TAX The textile millers of the country said that if the government could not withdraw the newly imposed 2 per cent advance income tax immediately, the sector could lose competitiveness which could lead to the closure of the textile factory units. They also urged the interim government to withdraw the 2 per cent AIT on the import of cotton by Monday. They were speaking at a special press conference organized by the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association on Saturday at the Gulshan Club in the capital. Recently, the National Board of Revenue issued an SRO imposing a 2 per cent AIT on imports of over 150 essentials and capital goods for industries including some major items like cotton, wheat, flour, maize, rice, soya beans, sunflower seeds, mustard seeds, linseed, sugar, bulbs, tubers, jet fuels, kerosene, diesel, furnace oil, LPG, natural gas, petroleum bitumen, iron oxides and zinc sulphate. The textile millers also questioned whether the move is designed to protect the interests of neighboring countries at the expense of Bangladesh’s textile industry. At the event, BTMA President Showkat Aziz Russel stated that with bank interest rates at 18 per cent and an additional 2 per cent being deducted as income tax from the working capital, it’s becoming impossible for them to continue doing business. He also said that importing yarn from India has become cheaper than producing it locally due to current regulations. He also questioned whether the government formulated policies to strengthen neighboring economies and generate employment there, or whether they worked tirelessly to safeguard the interests of the neighboring countries. In this regard, he urged the government to immediately withdraw the AIT, to exempt a specific tax of Tk 5 imposed per kilogram of domestic production of cotton yarn, and reconsider the corporate tax decisions. ‘If not, the consequences will be irreversible,’ he added, saying that the new tax, coupled with additional VAT burdens and reduced export incentives, comes at a time when mills are already grappling with a severe gas and electricity crisis. He also urged the government to engage in open dialogue with the industry, emphasizing that business owners are not adversaries but partners in economic development. BTMA vice-president Saleudh Zaman Khan said that vested interest groups were attempting to dismantle the textile industry. ‘This is nothing short of a deliberate attempt to destroy the country›s textile sector,’ he added. BTMA director Abdullah Al Mamun stated that they are on the brink of collapse, as many factory owners have already begun looking to sell their units due to existing challenges. The government never adjusted the AIT in the last 50 years, as they didn’t have the mechanism to adjust AIT, he added, saying that this new AIT has only added salt to their wounds. BTMA director Mohd Khorshed Alam stated that the dismantling of Bangladesh’s textile sector isn’t new, alleging that the agenda has been in motion for several years. ‘Five to six years ago, a neighboring country’s consulting firm collected the balance sheets of numerous local textile mills under the pretext of providing support. The conspiracy started there,’ he added. ‘But if we don’t raise these issues, how will they understand our challenges? If criticism leads to intimidation, a time will come when even regret won’t be enough.’ Hossain Mehmood, president of the Bangladesh Terry Towel and Linen Manufacturers and Exporters Association, stated that many textile businesses are now considering sourcing cotton from the US, particularly in light of the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US. ‘But with this 2 per cent AIT, that pathway would become economically unfeasible,’ he added. BTMA director Rajeeb Haider said that importing 2 per cent AIT on cotton imports would open the country as a playground for foreign exporters. ‘If we see the textile policy of India and Bangladesh in the last 20 years, it would be clear that Indian formulated policy to protect their sector where we formulated policy to hand over our sector to the foreigners,’ he added. Business leaders from the textiles, cotton, and knitwear sectors also spoke at the event.

The discussion took place when WRAP’s Head of Operations for Bangladesh and Pakistan, Kamrun Nahar, paid a courtesy call on BGMEA President Mahmud Hasan Khan at the BGMEA office in city’s Uttara, said a BGMEA press release. BGMEA Director Nafis-ud-Doula and WRAP manager of administrative operations Tanjina Afrin were also present at the meeting. During the discussion, various aspects of WRAP audits were highlighted. Both the sides also explored potential areas of cooperation, including full implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between BGMEA and WRAP in 2022 and updating audit standards to make them more relevant and practical, the release said. BGMEA President Mahmud Hasan Khan noted that BGMEA and WRAP have long been working together to advance ethical and sustainable production in the garment sector. He expressed the hope that a stronger partnership would further support the industry’s progress. Mahmud also requested WRAP to take initiatives to develop a Unified Code of Conduct for the apparel industry in Bangladesh in consultation with global brands, which could serve as a comprehensive set of standards for the sector. Referring to some challenges in the current audit practices, the BGMEA President emphasized the need to revise certain requirements and thus making those time befitting. The condition for keeping 30% of factory rooftops open is limiting the installation of solar power systems and restrictions on shared factory buildings should go for better suit to the realities of the industry, he said. The BGMEA President also urged WRAP to share with BGMEA the overall insights from WRAP’s audits of Bangladeshi garment factories. ‘Such insights would help formulate better policies and further strengthen Bangladesh’s position as a preferred hub for ethical production globally,’ he said. In response, WRAP’s Kamrun Nahar assured that efforts are going on in this regard and requested BGMEA’s more active participation in WRAP training programs for the BGMEA members. The meeting underscored the need for shared commitment of both organizations to support the development of Bangladesh’s apparel industry through responsible and sustainable practices.

{"title": "New Age | BTMA seeks Withdrawal of 2pc advance income tax", "body": "Leaders of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association on Monday at a meeting urged finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed to withdraw 2 per cent advance income tax for the import of cotton. Led by BTMA president Showkat Aziz Russel told the finance adviser that imposition of the tax by the National Board of Revenue in the current financial year of 2025–26 was not equitable. The finance ministry was expected to review the decision in the 24 hours, said the BTMA president, while talking to reporters after the meeting at the secretariat. The finance adviser did not make any comment about the meeting held on the 7th day of the new FY26. NBR chairman Abdur Rahman Khan was present at the meeting. Officials attending the meeting said that the businesses were asked to maintain the new rate as it was not imposed only for the import of cotton. The NBR has imposed 2 per cent of advance income tax on imports of over 150 essentials and capital goods for industries, including wheat, flour, maize, rice, soya beans, sunflower seeds, mustard seeds, linseed, sugar, bulbs, tubers, jet fuels, kerosene, diesel, furnace oil, LPG, natural gas, petroleum bitumen, iron oxides and zinc sulphate. During the meeting, the NBR chairman assured the BTMA leaders of meeting other demands linked to value added tax, said the officials. The day’s meeting was arranged within 48 hours after the BTMA held a special press conference at the Gulshan Club on Saturday to press home their demands, including withdrawal of 2 per cent advance income tax on cotton import. BTMA leaders also demanded exemption from a specific tax of Tk 5 imposed per kilogram of domestic production of cotton yarn. They also told the authorities to reconsider the corporate tax decisions. The textile millers have already questioned whether the move was designed to protect the interests of neighbouring countries at the expense of Bangladesh’s textile industry. The BTMA in its annual report for 2024said that investment in the primary textile sector was around $23 billion and the sector contributed around 13 per cent in the country’s Gross Domestic Product. According to the annual report, around 100 per cent yarn demand for knit readymade garments and 55–60 per cent yarn demand for woven readymade garments are met by the country’s primary textile that employs around 1.6 million workers, 60 per cent of which are women.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh retains rank of 2nd largest RMG exporter", "body": "Bangladesh has retained its position as the world’s second largest readymade garment exporter in global RMG trade in 2024, according to the latest data published by the World Trade Organisation on Tuesday. In the report titled World Trade Statistics: Key Insights and Trends in 2024, Bangladesh’s RMG exports were $38.48 billion, a slight 0.21 per cent higher than $38.40 billion in 2023. However, Bangladesh’s global share in RMG exports again witnessed a decline to 6.9 per cent in 2024, which was 7.38 per cent in 2023, 7.87 per cent 2022, and 6.37 per cent in 2021, said the WTO report compiled by Bangladesh Apparel Exchange. According to the Export Promotion Bureau data, the export earnings were also $38.48 billion in 2024, as the state agency provided data by reflecting real-time shipment updates as per Asycuda World and the National Board of Revenue, meaning there was no data discrepancy. Among the major RMG exporters, China remains the largest exporter of the RMG products in the global market with a 29.64 per cent market share and the country exported RMG goods worth $165.24 billion in 2024. Vietnam, Bangladesh’s arch rival in RMG export, secured third position with a market share of 6.09 per cent and exported apparel items worth $33.94 billion in 2024. In 2024, Turkiye exported apparel items worth $17.91 billion and secured the 4th position with a market share of 3.21 per cent where India obtained 5th position with a market share of 2.94 per cent and exported apparel items worth $16.36 billion, said WTO data. Among the major importers of the RMG goods, the European Union remained at the top with 34.3 per cent of global share, imported apparel goods worth $211 billion, where the United States was second, with 15 per cent of share and imported $92 billion in 2024. Japan imported clothing worth $25 billion in 2024, with a global share of 4 per cent, where the UK imported $21 billion (3.4 per cent share) and South Korea imported $13 billion with a 2.1 per cent global share. Regarding the merchandise trade, the WTO report said that in 2024, world trade in goods and commercial services, on a balance of payments basis, expanded by 4 per cent to $31.5 trillion, following a 2 per cent decline in 2023. Trade in goods rose by 2 per cent while services continued to grow strongly, up by 9 per cent and mirroring growth in 2023. The share of services in global trade increased to 26.4 per cent, its highest share since 2005.

{"title": "New Age | Cambodian garment workers fret Trump’s tariff threat", "body": "As Cambodian garment workers took breaks from toiling in sweltering factories on Tuesday, they feared for their jobs after US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose a 36 percent tariff. ‘I beg the US to reduce the tariff for the sake of workers in Cambodia,’ 38-year-old Im Sothearin told AFP as she rested from her work in an underwear factory in the capital Phnom Penh. ‘If they charge a high tariff, it is only workers who are going to suffer,’ said the mother-of-three who earns only $300 a month. ‘Factories might be closed or workers will have their wages lowered, or be forced to work faster.’ Cambodia—a major manufacturer of low-cost clothing for Western brands—was among the nations hardest hit by Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ blitz of tariff threats in April. The US president originally outlined a 49-percent rate if Cambodia failed to broker a deal with Washington. On Monday, he lowered it to 36 percent and extended the negotiation deadline to August 1. While the levy is lower than the original eye-watering figure, it has done little to allay anxieties. ‘If the tariff is that high, companies won’t have money to pay,’ 28-year-old pregnant worker Sreymom, who goes by only one name, told AFP as she bought fruit on her lunch break. ‘I am worried that we won’t have jobs to do,’ the 11-year veteran of the factory floor said. ‘I want the tariff to be reduced more.’ Cambodia’s chief negotiator in talks with Washington called the reduction in the proposed rate—announced in a letter among more than a dozen Trump despatched to trade partners—a ‘huge victory’. ‘We are so successful in negotiations,’ Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol told reporters in Phnom Penh. ‘We still have a chance to negotiate further to reduce the tariff rate more.’ But back in April commerce ministry spokesman Penn Sovicheat told AFP that harsh US tariffs on his country were ‘not reasonable’. Cambodia said it had about $10 billion in exports to the United States last year, mainly garment products. The nation has been paying a 10-percent standby rate as negotiators rush to make a deal. Many factories in Cambodia are Chinese-owned. The White House previously accused the kingdom of allowing Chinese goods to stop over on the way to US markets, thereby skirting steeper rates imposed on Beijing. Yi Mom has had a two-decade career in the garment industry. But she frets it may be ended if Cambodia fails to soften the blow threatened by the United States. ‘I fear that the high tariff will affect factories and will result in fewer jobs for workers,’ said the 47-year-old. ‘Then we will have low wages and will not be able to support our families.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/269473/cambodian-garment-workers-fret-trumps-tariff-threat", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 480}
{"title": "New Age | 250 RMG units Leed-certified now", "body": "Two new Bangladeshi readymade garment factory units have achieved United States Green Building Council’s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (Leed) certificates, boasting a total of 250 Leed-certified factories in the country. Of the 250 green factories, 105 are platinum-rated, 131 gold-rated, 10 silver-rated and four certified factories, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. In July, Gazipur-based Evitex Apparels Limited obtained a gold certificate under LEED O+M: Existing Building v4.1 rating system with a score of 75. Moreover, Aswad Composite Mills Ltd - Unit 2, a factory unit based in Ashulia of Dhaka, achieved also gold certificate with a score of 64 under LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system. So far, 68 of the world’s top 100 LEED factories, including nine of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20, are in Bangladesh. This success is expected to attract new investment and partnerships, reinforcing Bangladesh’s position as a sustainable manufacturing hub. According to industry insiders, a total of 550 factories of Bangladesh are awaiting the USGBC’s LEED certification. The factories of the country have been obtaining the LEED certificate since 2011. The USGBC honours factories based on several criteria: transformation performance, energy, water and waste management. The best performers are rated platinum, followed by gold and silver. According to industry insiders, these criteria help green factories significantly reduce operational costs over time, even though they may initially spend more to set up. Mohiuddin Rubel, managing director of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and former director of the BGMEA, said that as the world increasingly prioritised ESG performance and sustainability in supply chains, this milestone enhanced the country’s global image. According to apparel manufacturers, the move towards green factory buildings helped regain Bangladesh’s image after the Rana Plaza tragedy, which claimed 1,134 lives and left more than 2,000 injured.

{"title": "New Age | FY25: Apparel exports to key destinations rise", "body": "The export of readymade garment items from Bangladesh to its key destinations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe, experienced considerable growth in the recently concluded financial year 2024-25. According to country-wise detailed export data of the Export Promotion Bureau, compiled by the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange, the country’s RMG manufacturers earned $39.34, by fetching a positive growth of 8.84 per cent from $36.15 billion in FY24. The RMG exporters stated that the significant shift of orders from China to Bangladesh has accelerated Bangladesh’s growth momentum over the past few months, despite ongoing tariff issues and the country’s political transition. According to the EPB data, in FY25, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $19.71 billion to European Union countries, 9.10 per cent higher than the $18.06 billion in FY24. The export earnings from the EU covered 50.1 per cent of the total earnings from RMG exports. The Bangladeshi RMG manufacturers earned $7.54 billion from the US, the single largest destination of the country’s exporters, in FY25, which was 13.79 per cent higher than the $6.63 billion earned in FY24. The earnings from the North American country accounted for 19.18 per cent of the total revenue. With a narrow growth of 3.68 per cent, Bangladesh secured $4.34 billion from the UK in FY25, up from $4.19 billion in FY24. Bangladeshi RMG exporters shipped apparel items worth $1.3 billion to Canada in FY25, a 12.07 per cent increase from the $1.16 billion earned in FY24. Among the EU countries, Germany remained Bangladesh’s largest export destination, from which the country earned $4.95 billion in FY25, according to the EPB data. Following Germany, the export earnings from Spain stood at $3.39 billion, those from France at $2.15 billion, the Netherlands at $2.08 billion, Poland at $1.69 billion, and Italy at $1.54 billion, with positive growth maintained at every destination. Regarding apparel exports, countries such as the US, Canada, the UK, and the EU are considered traditional markets, while other countries are deemed non-traditional. Japan, Australia, Russia, India, China, South Korea, the UAE, Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico are major non-traditional export destinations. In FY25, export earnings from the non-traditional markets also experienced positive growth, with an overall rise of 5.61 per cent to $6.44 billion, up from $6.09 billion in FY24. The non-traditional market represented 16.36 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports. In FY25, Japan led these markets with imports worth $1.18 billion from Bangladesh, followed by Australia $813.62 million and India $644.24 million. Moreover, RMG exports to Turkey and South Korea also witnessed significant earnings, amounting to $449.9 million and $411.46 million, respectively. According to the EPB data, export earnings from almost all major destinations experienced a considerable growth rate in FY25. Speaking to New Age, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that in the past few months, Bangladesh had witnessed a rise in purchase orders. ‘Moreover, a considerable number of orders started to shift from China to Bangladesh due to US tariff, even some Chinese manufacturers shifted their offices and facilities to the country and hired factories,’ he added. Meanwhile, according to the World Trade Organization Data, China’s share in the global apparel market declined to 29 per cent in 2024 from over 31 per cent in 2023. Inamul Haq Khan also said that buyers consistently trusted Bangladesh due to its ethical production practices. Regarding the US tariff issue, he said that although the tariff talks concluded with a scope for further discussion, they remain hopeful that a positive outcome may still be achieved. ‘We have come to know that the US and Bangladesh agreed on about 80 per cent of the conditions. We expect, the talks would finally succeed and the tariff might be lowered to 20 per cent-25 per cent,’ he added. He also said that, besides the US, Bangladesh has huge potential in increasing its exports to non-traditional markets, such as Australia, Japan, Korea, the Middle East, and Latin America. Mohiuddin Rubel, former BGMEA director, told New Age that the besides conventional markets, nontraditional market size was about $150 in 2024, where Bangladesh had only 6 per cent share. ‘There is significant potential for expansion in the markets like Japan, Australia and other markets,’ he added. He urged manufacturers to focus on cultivating new markets and products through relentless innovation to maintain a competitive edge. Earlier, Professor Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, told New Age that the export was mainly volume-driven, not value-driven. He also suggested that Bangladesh needs to focus on upscaling its product manufacturing to sustain growth, along with local value addition, intra-RMG diversification, and market and product diversification. He also said that it is high time to focus on graduation from the least developed country status, Trump’s tariff, and a silent trade war with India.

The BGMEA leadership also emphasized the need for enhanced market intelligence sharing and stronger business-to-business connectivity between Korean and Bangladeshi enterprises to deepen economic cooperation. Mahmud made the request when Park Young-sik, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to Bangladesh, met him at the BGMEA Complex in the capital’s Uttara on Monday. The meeting focused on exploring avenues to strengthen bilateral trade and investment ties between Bangladesh and South Korea. Both sides discussed potential areas of collaboration, with particular emphasis on the textile and garment sectors. BGMEA vice-president Md Shehab Udduza Chowdhury, director Faisal Samad, and member Israfil Atique were present at the meeting, said a press release. The Ambassador was accompanied by Kim Jeong ki, Consul at the Korean Embassy in Dhaka, and Noh Chy Woo, Country Head, Spandex Performance Unit and Spandex Plant, Hyosung TNC Corporation (Bangladesh Liaison Office). During the meeting, BGMEA President Mahmud Hasan Khan highlighted Bangladesh’s growing potential as a destination for South Korean exports of man-made fibers, textile machinery, chemical dyes, and other raw materials. He also noted that South Korea represents a promising market for Bangladeshi apparel exports, offering significant opportunities for mutually beneficial trade. President Mahmud Hasan Khan expressed appreciation for South Korea’s historical support in the development of Bangladesh’s garment industry—particularly in the areas of technical assistance and workforce training during the industry’s formative years. Ambassador Park Young-sik underscored the importance of further aligning Bangladesh’s Export Processing Zones (EPZ) Act 2019 with the Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 to create a more conducive environment for foreign investors. He also highlighted the need to improve labor productivity and the operational efficiency of the Chattogram port, key to facilitating smoother trade operations. Both parties expressed optimism that the signing of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) or an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) between Bangladesh and South Korea would significantly benefit both countries by fostering deeper economic integration. BGMEA president Mahmud Hasan Khan thanked the South Korean government for its continued support and expressed confidence that bilateral relations will continue to strengthen in the coming years.

{"title": "New Age | RMG makers focus on nontraditional markets", "body": "US TARIFF CHALLENGES The country's apparel manufacturers are planning to utilise the full potential of non-traditional markets amid a 35 per cent tariff recently imposed by the United States. Working on the market over the past few decades, manufacturers have said that nontraditional destinations also face multifaceted challenges, including tariffs. However, the recently announced US tariff triggered them to rethink the new markets, they added. Speaking to New Age, Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, stated that they have been working to increase their exports for over 10 years. ‘However, as single market, each destination is comparatively small and there are also tariff-related and other challenges in those markets,’ he added. Regarding apparel exports, countries such as the US, Canada, the UK, and the EU are considered traditional markets, while other countries are deemed non-traditional. Japan, Australia, Russia, India, China, South Korea, the UAE, Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico are major non-traditional export destinations. In the financial year 2024-25, export earnings from the non-traditional markets also experienced positive growth, with an overall rise of 5.61 per cent to $6.44 billion, up from $6.09 billion in FY24. The non-traditional market represented 16.36 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports. In FY25, Bangladeshi RMG manufacturers earned $7.54 billion from the US, the single largest destination of the country’s exporters. The earnings from the North American country accounted for 19.18 per cent of the total revenue. Many insiders said that if exporters could export RMG items worth $10 billion to the nontraditional markets in the coming years, it could alleviate their overreliance on the US market, which has already become saturated and may be severely impacted by the tariff slump. Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the BGMEA, told New Age Bangladesh was doing well at most of the nontraditional market destinations. ‘However, we cannot lose the US market. We have to focus on the nontraditional markets by keeping our position in the US,’ he added. He also stated that markets such as Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Middle East, and Latin America could be the game-changers in Bangladesh’s exports. However, despite having significant growth potential and maintaining positive growth, the new markets faced challenges, including tariffs. ‘Although we import cotton from Brazil with zero duty, our RMG products face 30 per cent-35 per cent tariff in the Brazilian market,’ said Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu. He also stated that if they urged a duty waiver, Brazil would seek to export meat to Bangladesh, which is almost impossible given the current agricultural situation. ‘Japan is a big market but they primarily focus on near sourcing, meaning import from Vietnam and China,’ he added. He also mentioned that there are some design and branding-related issues associated with exporting to the Middle East. ‘But Australia and South Korea are potential markets, though Latin America’s potential is very high. After resolving the US tariff issue, we would work on those of the Latin America,’ he added. Meanwhile, according to World Trade Organisation data for 2024, Japan was the 3rd largest consumer of apparel items, while South Korea was fifth. In FY25, Japan imported RMG items worth $1.18 billion from Bangladesh, followed by Australia $813.62 million and India $644.24 million. Moreover, RMG exports to Turkey and South Korea also witnessed significant earnings, amounting to $449.9 million and $411.46 million, respectively. Some businesses are urged to adapt to the trends of the nontraditional markets to capture those. Mohiuddin Rubel, former BGMEA director and managing director of the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange, told New Age that Japan could be a potential market for Bangladesh. ‘In this regard, we should capture their fashion trends and to adapt with it. They primarily focus on fast fashion, high value and high quality and for these, we have to conduct proper research on them,’ he added. He also said that the pricing capacity of Japan, Australia and Korea is high. Talking to New Age, Professor Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, said that they had been advocating for market diversification for several years. ‘To address the challenges, shocks and adverse decision, Bangladesh must focus on market diversification along with products,’ he added. The manufacturers stated that there are also some challenges in non-traditional markets, including payment issues with Russia, land port issues with India, and design issues in the Middle East. To address these, they urged the exporters to focus on design studios, negotiations, research and development. They also said that the country must focus on signing free trade agreements or preferential trading agreements with nontraditional destinations to smoothen export lines.

{"title": "New Age | Three more RMG factory units get LEED certificate", "body": "The number of United States Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certified factories reached 253, as three new factory units recently achieved the certification. Of the 253 green factories, 105 are platinum-rated, 132 are gold-rated, 12 are silver-rated, and four are certified factories, according to the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange. In July, Tangail-based Comfit Rainbow Dyeing and Finishing Ltd. obtained a gold certificate under the LEED O+M: Existing Building v4.1 rating system, achieving a score of 75. Moreover, the Habiganj-based two factory units, Saiham Cotton Mills Limited Units 1 and 2, also achieved a silver certificate under the LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system. Both factory units obtained a score of 58. So far, 68 of the world’s top 100 LEED factories, including nine of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20, are in Bangladesh. This success is expected to attract new investment and partnerships, reinforcing Bangladesh’s position as a sustainable manufacturing hub. According to industry insiders, a total of 550 factories were awaiting the USGBC’s LEED certification. The factories of Bangladesh have been obtaining the LEED certificate since 2011. The USGBC honours factories based on several criteria: transformation performance, energy, water and waste management. The best performers are rated platinum, followed by gold and silver. According to industry insiders, these criteria enable green factories to significantly reduce operational costs over time, even though they may initially incur higher setup costs. Mohiuddin Rubel, managing director of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and former director of the BGMEA, said that as the world increasingly prioritised ESG performance and sustainability in supply chains, this milestone enhanced the country’s global image. According to apparel manufacturers, the move towards green factory buildings helped regain Bangladesh›s image after the Rana Plaza tragedy, which claimed 1,134 lives and left more than 2,000 injured.

According to the latest data published by the US Office of Textiles and Apparel, Bangladeshi exporters shipped RMG items worth $2.9 billion in the same period of 2024. During the first five months of 2025, Bangladesh outpaced its major competitors in terms of export growth rates. During January-May of 2025, the RMG exports to the European Union countries were $8.97, which was 17.8 per cent higher form $7.61 billion in the January-May period of 2024, said the Eurostat Data. Apart from US and EU, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $4.35 billion to other markets including UK, Canada, and non-traditional markets in January-May of 2025. The North American country’s RMG imports from its global suppliers also witnessed a positive growth of 7.08 per cent to $31.70 billion in January-May 2025, compared with $ 29.60 billion in the same period of 2024. In terms of volume, Bangladeshi RMG exports to the US in the mentioned period also saw a positive growth of 21.04 per cent to 1.15 billion square metres, up from 956.14 million square metres in the same period in 2024, according to OTEXA data. As the third-largest supplier to the US, Bangladesh’s market share in the North American country stood at 9.80 per cent as of May 2025. Amid the ongoing trade war between the US and China, Vietnam remained the top exporter for the past several months, surpassing China. In January-May, with a positive growth of 16.35 per cent, Vietnam exported apparel items worth $6.29 billion, surpassing the $5.40 billion recorded in the same period of 2024. Vietnam held a market share of 19.50 per cent.

Followed by Bangladesh, India secured the fourth position in the US market by exporting RMG items worth $2.44 billion in January-May of 2025, registering a positive growth of 16.96 per cent compared with that of $2.08 billion in the same period of 2024, with a market share of 6.20 per cent in the US. RMG exports from Indonesia and Cambodia were $1.87 billion and $1.51 billion in the January-May period of 2025, with a market share of 5.5 per cent and 4.95 per cent, respectively, which made them the fifth and sixth largest RMG suppliers. According to the OTEXA data, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the US in 2024 were $7.34 billion, and in 2023, they were $7.29 billion. However, the country’s RMG manufacturers are concerned that the US has recently imposed a 35 per cent tariff on Bangladesh, which will be added to the existing 15 per cent to 22 per cent tariff on August 1. On July 11, Bangladesh concluded its second round of tariff talks with the US Trade Representative without any result. However, commerce adviser Sk Bashir Uddin said on July 14 that the third round of negotiations with the US over tariff issues was likely to start this week, stating that they were expecting a schedule from their US counterpart. Talking to New Age, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said on Sunday that they still have orders from the US. ‘We have not lost the US market and we still getting orders from the US. We hope the government could conclude a fruitful discussion on the tariff issue,’ he added. Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the BGMEA and managing director of the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange, said that these insights shed light on the dynamic landscape of apparel imports, showcasing the evolving trends in the industry. ‘With a well-established sourcing base in Bangladesh, it’s essential to acknowledge the long-standing foundation that has been developed. Bangladesh needs to focus on reducing newly imposed tariffs and aligning them with competitors to boost competitiveness,’ he added.

They also claimed the factory workers’ allegation of selling the factory as ‘rumour,’ which was spread to initiate an unusual situation at the factory. Talking to New Age, KG Morshed, managing director of Eurozone Fashion, confirmed that the factory would start its regular operation today. ‘The workers had some logical demands and we accepted those in presence of representatives from the labour department,’ he added. He also stated that products worth $5 million were ready to ship and in this situation, he would not sell the factory. ‘Some vested interest groups spread rumour to destabilise operations, which led to an unusual situation. After discussing, we accepted logical demands of the workers and everything was normal,’ he added. Based on the current situation, they declared Sunday and Monday as general holidays and the workers accepted this, he said. Earlier on Monday, a group of agitated workers blocked the managing director in his office, claiming he was selling the factory without paying the workers. Md Rakibul Hasan, officer-in-charge of Vatara Police Station, told New Age that police along with army personnel rescued the owner of the factory around 5:00pm on the day. ‘There was a rumour that the factory might shut its operation and for this reason, the workers blockaded the owner,’ he added. He also said that they then took the situation under control and the workers left the place peacefully and would join the workplace on Tuesday morning. Speaking to New Age, Babul Akhter, president of IndustriALL Bangladesh Council, said that he had heard about the allegations made by the workers and instructed them to resolve the issues through discussion. ‘I urged them to sit with us for a discussion aiming to resolve the issues,’ he said.

Handa Industries Ltd chairman Han Chun announced the plan when he met Bangladesh interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka on Tuesday. Handa had initially planned to invest US$ 150 million in Bangladesh’s textile sector and signed a memorandum of understanding with Bangladesh authorities during the Bangladesh Investment Summit in April 2025. Following further assessments and with strong support from Bangladesh authorities, Handa has since increased its investment plan to approximately US$ 250 million. The company has now decided to set up three factories in Bangladesh-two garment processing and one knitting and dyeing unit-which are expected to create 25,000 jobs. ‘We decided to increase our investment as we got confidence after talks with the officials of the government agencies including BIDA (Bangladesh Investment Development Authority),BEZA (Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority) and BEPZA (Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority)’ said Han Chun. ‘We would like to bring the latest technologies to Bangladesh’s garment and textiles industries through our projects,’ he said. BIDA, BEZA and BEPZA officials said this is one of largest single Chinese investments in Bangladesh’s textile sector. Chief adviser Prof Yunus welcomed the investment plan of Handa Industries Ltd. ‘You take the leadership in Chinese investment in Bangladesh’s textile sector and encourage other Chinese investors to come here,’ he said. He also urged Handa Industries Ltd. to train up Bangladeshi designers to enable them to learn the taste of buyers. Han Chun presented the chief adviser a design of their factory that they are going to set up in the Mirsharai economic zone. ‘It looks like a beautiful painting to me,’ said the chief adviser, hailing the design. The land lease agreement for the garment factory in Mirsharai will be signed on Wednesday with an investment value of US$ 80 million in phase-1. The finalisation of land and other facilities for phase-2 is under process now and is expected to be finished by the end of 2025.

Meanwhile, in another notification, the Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority instructed its factories to make a decision based on its regulations. The notifications from the BGMEA, BKMEA, and BTMA stated that, in accordance with Section 118 of the Bangladesh Labour Act, 2006, and Rule 110 of the Bangladesh Labour Rules, 2015, garment and textile factories typically determine their festival holidays at the beginning of each year. Since the declaration of the government general holiday has been made at mid-year, it has created some uncertainty among factory owners regarding its observance. Although there is no legal obligation for industrial establishments to observe this newly declared holiday, they urged their member factories to remain closed on August 5 out of respect for the martyrs of the July Mass Uprising and in solidarity with the government›s decision. Moreover, they urged that this holiday be duly considered when determining next year’s festival holiday calendar, in accordance with relevant labour laws and regulations. Earlier, in July, the government officially declared August 5 as ‘July Mass Uprising Day’, and also proclaimed the day as a general holiday through a gazette notification.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to US see 25pc growth in Jan-Jun", "body": "The readymade garment exports to the United States from Bangladesh witnessed a robust growth of 25.13 per cent to $4.25 billion in the first half of 2025, from January to June. According to the latest data published by the US Office of Textiles and Apparel, Bangladeshi exporters exported RMG items worth $3.4 billion in the same period of 2024. During the first half of 2025, Bangladesh outpaced almost all its major competitors in terms of export growth rates in the US — the country›s single largest export destination. Exporters stated that the announcement of the revised US reciprocal tariff of 20 per cent was a positive signal for export earnings from the US. They also stated that the shift of orders from China to Bangladesh, due to the trade war with the US, has accelerated exports. In single month of June 2025, US imported RMG items worth $722.54 million from Bangladesh, a 45 per cent higher from $496.64 million in June of 2024. According to the Otexa data, the North American country’s RMG imports from its global suppliers also witnessed a positive growth of 6.76 per cent to $38.15 billion in January-June of 2025, higher from $35.74 billion in the same period of 2024. In terms of volume, Bangladeshi RMG exports to the US also experienced positive growth of 23.81 per cent to 1.37 billion square metres in H1 of 2025, up from 1.12 billion square metres in the same period in 2024. As the third-largest supplier to the US, Bangladesh’s market share in the North American country stood at 10.03 per cent as of May 2025. Amid the ongoing trade war between the US and China, Vietnam remained the top exporter for the past several months, surpassing China. In January-June, Vietnam›s apparel exports grew by 17.97 per cent, reaching $7.76 billion, surpassing the $6.58 billion recorded in the first half of 2025. Vietnam held a market share of 19.79 per cent. As the second-largest exporter, China exported apparel items worth $5.73 billion during H1 of 2025, representing a 16.14 per cent decline from $6.83 billion in the same period of 2024, and capturing a market share of 18.88 per cent. Followed by Bangladesh, India secured the fourth position in the US market by exporting RMG items worth $2.84 billion in January-June of 2025, registering a positive growth of 16.26 per cent compared with that of $2.44 billion in the same period of 2024, with a market share of 6.23 per cent in the US market. RMG exports from Indonesia and Cambodia were $2.25 billion and $1.99 billion in the first half of 2025, with a market share of 5.63 per cent and 5.11 per cent, respectively, making them the fifth and sixth largest RMG suppliers. On July 31, the Trump administration revised the reciprocal tariff on Bangladeshi goods to 20 per cent, following a series of discussions. Earlier, on July 8, it was declared 35 per cent, following the 37 per cent announced on April 2. Talking to New Age, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the exports to US increased due to the shifting of orders from China. ‘China’s share and export at US market gradually declining due to trade war and tariff issues, and the orders are shifting to other manufacturing countries,’ he added. He also said that as Bangladesh can manufacture shifting orders along with buyers’ confidence, exports are increasing. Echoing a similar sentiment, former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel said that US buyers have always trusted Bangladeshi products. ‘As Trump administration announced new tariff, we have opportunity to do more well in the coming years,’ he added. If a similar situation persists for China, one day, Bangladesh could outpace them in market share in the US market, he added, urging adequate policy support from the government and manufacturers to focus on diversified and high-value products. According to the OTEXA data, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the US in 2024 were $7.34 billion, and in 2023, they were $7.29 billion.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports drop in Apr-Jun due to NBR protest, tariff fear", "body": "The export of readymade garments experienced negative growth in the April-June quarter of the past financial year 2024-25, compared to the preceding quarter of January-March in FY25, primarily due to extended protests by the National Board of Revenue officials and tariff concerns. According to Bangladesh Bank data, the export from the RMG in the final quarter of FY25 stood at $9.11 billion, which was 11.92 per cent lower than $10.34 billion in the January-March quarter of FY25. However, the earnings from the same quarter of the previous financial year witnessed a 3.15 per cent growth. The earnings in the final quarter of FY24 were $8.83 billion, said the central bank data. The BB data, titled Quarterly Review of Readymade Garments, stated that during April-June of FY25, Bangladesh’s RMG sector faced multiple pressing issues, including downswings in global economic activity and trade policy shifts, which impacted its weak quarterly export performance. Moreover, key among these policy shifts was the announcement of a 35 per cent tariff by the United States, which, although not yet implemented, might cause order deferrals and heightened uncertainty among buyers. Simultaneously, India restricted RMG imports from Bangladesh via land routes, which disrupted logistics and limited Bangladesh’s access to a key regional market, the central bank added. Along with these issues, the NBR encountered an employee strike that caused customs delays, impeded smooth shipment processing and significantly hindered the timely shipment of goods. Meanwhile, the US reduced tariffs on Bangladeshi exports to 20 per cent on July 31, bringing relief for the country’s exporters, especially RMG makers. The broader global economic headwinds, combined with ongoing domestic issues related to rising production costs and limited diversification of export markets, contributed to a volatile export trend, according to the central bank report. During the final quarter of FY25, the import value of raw materials such as raw cotton, synthetic or viscose fibre, synthetic or mixed yarn, cotton yarn, and textile fabrics and accessories for garments was $3.94 billion, accounting for 43.22 per cent of total RMG export earnings. The net exports from this sector totalled $5.18 billion in the April-June period of FY25. The central bank report stated that net exports were 15.08 per cent lower than those of the preceding quarter, January-March, which was $6.09 billion. The net exports, however, were 2.69 per cent higher than those of the same quarter of FY24, which was $5.04 billion. During FY25, the RMG sector made a significant contribution of 8.52 per cent to Bangladesh’s nominal GDP. The total RMG export earnings for FY25 stood at $39.35 billion, indicating a higher growth of 8.90 per cent as compared to that of the previous fiscal year’s $36.13 billion, the Bangladesh Bank report added. During April-June of FY25, Bangladesh’s RMG exports were primarily directed to nine major destinations: including the US, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Canada and Belgium. Export earnings from these countries amounted to $7.24 billion during the reporting period. According to the quarterly report, the government and the Bangladesh Bank have taken several measures to facilitate the production and export of the RMG sector, including pre-shipment credit, incentives for export expansion and funds for export green transformation, export facilitation and export development. The report also stated that the performance of Bangladesh’s RMG sector during April-June FY25 was mixed due to external shocks and domestic inefficiencies. Rising geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions and infrastructure bottlenecks pose a threat to sustained growth unless addressed proactively. The report also expected that the significant performance of the RMG sector would set a positive outlook for the coming years and would position Bangladesh as a leading apparel exporter on the global stage.

{"title": "New Age | BGMEA seeks data on losses in NBR protests", "body": "The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association urged its members to submit details of financial losses caused by the ‘complete shutdown’ programme observed by employees of the customs, VAT, and tax departments. The employees of the National Board of Revenue observed a complete shutdown programme on June 28 and 29 across the country as a part of their about 1.5-month-long protests against the government›s decision to restructure the NBR. In a notice issued on August 7, the BGMEA stated that the Ministry of Finance’s Internal Resources Division has formed an inter-ministerial committee, with the BGMEA as a member, to assess the economic impact of the complete shutdown. As per the committee’s decision on August 4, the BGMEA requested its members to submit their loss assessments using the prescribed format provided by the BGMEA. BGMEA noted that the information will be used to support the committee’s activities in addressing the matter. NBR officials had held protest programmes against the restructuring of the revenue board, and their protests intensified after the interim government introduced the Revenue Policy and Revenue Management Ordinance 2025 on May 12. The splitting led to protests, including pen-down strikes, sit-ins, and non-cooperation, for nearly one and a half months, including a march to the NBR and a ‘complete shutdown’ in June 28-29. According to businesses, the protests severely hampered customs operations and cargo clearance processes, and they also hindered revenue collection and export-import activities in the final month of the 2024-25 financial year. Earlier, on June 28, in a press conference, Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, stated that a complete shutdown of operations disrupted import and export activities worth approximately Tk 2,500 crore each day, thereby increasing the risk of losing orders. On July 16, the government formed an inter-ministerial committee to assess the economic losses caused by the protests and complete shutdowns of employees in the customs, VAT, and tax departments under the National Board of Revenue. According to a notification issued by the Internal Resources Division under the Ministry of Finance, the nine-member committee will assess the revenue loss incurred due to the closure of the Chattogram Customs House for two days in June 28-29.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exporters for focusing on increase competitiveness", "body": "US TARIFF ON INDIA The readymade garment exporters of the country said that they should focus on increasing competitiveness, building capability and removing non-tariff barriers, rather than overthinking the United States’ tariffs on India, China and other rivals. They also stated that tariff hikes on India and unresolved trade tensions with China might divert some orders to Bangladesh, but this would be a short-lived issue. Initially, the US imposed a 37 per cent reciprocal tariff on Bangladesh on April 2, which was then lowered to 35 per cent on July 8 and finally reduced to 20 per cent on July 31 following a series of negotiations. Meanwhile, the US recently extended its trade truce with China by another 90 days, leaving key tariff disputes unsettled. Moreover, India is bearing the brunt of steep US tariffs, now totalling 50 per cent, aimed at penalising the country for its continued imports of Russian oil. This shift has created some opportunities for Bangladesh’s RMG industry, as buyers might reconsider their sourcing strategies. ‘However, we export roughly 20 per cent of our total products to the US and India is still behind us in that market. I don’t think an order shift from India would be as rejoicing as people think,’ said Mohiuddin Rubel, additional managing director of Denim Expert Limited. He also said that they have already received the orders shifting from China for the past several months. According to the OTEXA data, Bangladesh exported RMG items to the US worth $7.34 billion, while China and India exported $16.5 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Sparrow Group manufactures more than 50 per cent of its $300 million worth of annual export goods for almost 14 major iconic US brands, including Gap, Levi’s, American Eagle, Talbots, Loft, and Kohl’s. Shovon Islam, managing director of the Sparrow Group, told New Age that he didn’t see any reason to become happy with higher tariffs on rivals. ‘Rather, we should increase our efficiency and competitiveness,’ he added. Shifting some orders from India and China might provide short-term relief, but Bangladesh needs to consider design studios, innovation, research and development, and presentation. He also said that India produces several high-end products and they are rich in design and presentation, but Bangladesh doesn’t have those capabilities and is still stuck on manufacturing basic items only. ‘If we could develop our R&D, design, and capabilities, we may attract more orders from the US, even if the tariffs on our rival were imposed at zero,’ he added. Bangladesh typically exports basic items; 18 products account for about 80 per cent of Bangladesh’s RMG exports, according to data from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. Asian Apparel Limited, a leading apparel exporter based in Chattogram, with nearly $340 million in annual exports, 95 per cent of which are directed to the US. Khondaker Belayet Hossain, executive director of the company, said that they don’t think the orders from India and China will shift to Bangladesh overnight. ‘They would evaluate the feasibility and capacity of the factories and then they might put in purchase orders,’ he added. Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that they have orders lined up until December. ‘Recently, representatives of two US buyers visited our company for preliminary talks, but we couldn’t take their orders due to lack of available space,’ he added. Khan, also managing director of Ananta Garments Limited, stated that buyers from China have been searching for factories for several months and have also rented closed factories. ‘Buyers have limited options as Vietnam and Cambodia face capacity constraints, making it tough for them to expand production,’ he added. However, Professor Mustafizur Rahman, a distinguished fellow of the Centre for Policy Dialogue, told New Age that some orders might shift to Bangladesh. ‘But we should focus on productivity, diversity, cost of doing business, efficiency and capacity building,’ he added. The question of who would grab the orders, Bangladesh or its competitors, highly relies on the facts mentioned above, he added. Echoing the same sentiment, Shovon Islam stated that Bangladesh should focus on building competitiveness, increasing efficiency, and removing non-tariff barriers. ‘We have issues in customs and ports, as there are instances of delays for 15-20 days just for a mistake in the HS code,’ he added. He also stated that inefficiency, harassment and corruption are the primary barriers to obtaining orders, which should be addressed first. He also urged the government to introduce clearance systems within 24 hours for fabrics. Belayet Hossain stated that customs and port officials lack the necessary mindset to support the country’s RMG sector. ‘Even they shut down the services just for their own interests. Efficiency is a must to become competitive,’ he added. Inamul Haq Khan also urged the government to ensure that policies are supported. The exporters also said that the US is important, but not the sole market for them, and for this reason, they should focus on sustaining competitiveness in EU markets. Bangladesh exported apparel items worth $38.48 billion in the 2024 calendar year and $39.24 billion in FY2024-25. Bangladesh set a target of exporting RMG items worth $44 billion in FY2025-26.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh to stay as top cotton importer", "body": "Bangladesh, the second-largest exporter of readymade garment items, is poised to remain the world’s largest raw cotton importer in the marketing year 2025-26, said the US Department of Agriculture. However, the consumption of cotton is expected to witness a slight decline to 8.1 million bales, which was previously forecasted at 8.4 million bales in July of this year. According to the data titled ‘Cotton: World Markets and Trade’ issued by the Foreign Agricultural Service under the USDA on Tuesday, Bangladesh is projected to import 8.1 million bales of cotton in MY26, which starts in August. USDA data show that in MY25, Bangladesh’s imports were expected to be 8.1 million bales, which was approximately 7.5 million bales in MY24. According to the USDA report, the consumption forecast for Bangladesh was lowered by 3 lakh bales due to lower consumption expectations. Vietnam, one of Bangladesh’s closest competitors in RMG exports, is projected to import 8 million bales of cotton in MY26. In contrast, China is expected to import 5.3 million bales, having imported 15 million bales in MY24. However, Bangladesh remained the top cotton importer, with 7 million bales imported in MY23 and 8.45 million bales in MY22. Meanwhile, on March 31, the USDA, in its report titled ‘Cotton and Products Annual’, stated that Bangladesh’s cotton imports would witness a slight increase in MY26 thanks to increasing demand for RMG items. According to the Export Promotion Bureau’s data, in FY25, Bangladesh’s RMG exports experienced a positive year-on-year growth of 8.84 per cent to $39.35 billion. In MY24, West African cotton held the largest market share in Bangladesh (37 per cent), while other major exporters included Brazil (17 per cent), India (23 per cent), and the United States (9 per cent). However, the scenario for the US might witness a significant change as Bangladesh is expected to import more cotton from the US. As part of its tariff negotiations with the US counterpart to reduce the trade deficit, Bangladesh would increase imports of cotton from the US. The US imposed a reciprocal tariff of 37 per cent on Bangladesh in April, which was subsequently lowered to 35 per cent on July 8 and further reduced to 20 per cent on July 31 following a series of negotiations. Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association held an emergency Board of Directors meeting on August 6, 2025, to share updates on the US visit and to outline the next steps. During the meeting, the BTMA President Showkat Aziz Russell said that they intend to import $1 billion worth of cotton from the United States as part of efforts to reduce the trade imbalance between the two countries. Earlier, in 2023, Bangladesh lifted the double fumigation requirement for US cotton, allowing US cotton to enter Bangladesh without fumigation at the port of entry. This change saved importers millions of dollars and five days of waiting time. According to the USDA report, global production is expected to decrease by more than 1.8 million bales to 116.6 million, as the production of minor crops in the US, Sudan, Uzbekistan, and Mali exceeds that of a larger crop in China in MY26. China’s production might be raised 500,000 bales to 31.5 million on higher yields; however, US production is expected to be lowered 1.4 million bales to 13.2 million on a smaller area harvested. According to the USDA, Bangladeshi producers could produce approximately 153,000 bales of cotton on 45,000 hectares of land, which accounts for less than 2 per cent of its total consumption.

{"title": "New Age | 258 RMG units now Leed-certified", "body": "Five new Bangladeshi readymade garment factory units have achieved the United States Green Building Council’s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification, bringing the total number of LEED-certified factories in the country to 258. Of the 258 green factories, 109 are platinum-rated, 133 are gold-rated, 12 are silver-rated, and four are certified, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. In August, Ashulia-based South End Sweater Company Ltd obtained a platinum certificate under the LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system, achieving a score of 85. Moreover, the Sirajganj-based Purbani Fashion Ltd also achieved a platinum certificate under the LEED O+M: Existing Buildings v4.1 rating system. Both factory units obtained a score of 83. KDS Fashion Ltd, a factory based in Chattogram, has obtained a platinum certificate under the LEED O+M: Existing Buildings v4.1 rating system. Both factory units obtained a score of 84. Mymensingh-based Raidha Collection Limited achieved a platinum certificate under the LEED O+M: Existing Buildings v4.1 rating system. Both factory units obtained a score of 90. In July, Texeurop BD Ltd, a Gazipur-based factory unit, received a gold certificate under the LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system, achieving a score of 70. So far, 68 of the world’s top 100 LEED factories, including nine of the top 10 and 18 of the top 20, are in Bangladesh. This success is expected to attract new investment and partnerships, reinforcing Bangladesh’s position as a sustainable manufacturing hub. According to industry insiders, a total of 550 factories were awaiting the USGBC’s LEED certification. The factories of Bangladesh have been obtaining the LEED certificate since 2011. The USGBC honours factories based on several criteria: transformation performance, energy, water, and waste management. The best performers are rated platinum, followed by gold and silver. According to industry insiders, these criteria enable green factories to significantly reduce operational costs over time, even though they may initially incur higher setup costs. Mohiuddin Rubel, managing director of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and former director of the BGMEA, said that as the world increasingly prioritised ESG performance and sustainability in supply chains, this milestone enhanced the country’s global image. He also said that this achievement comes at a time when the industry was navigating significant headwinds, including just settled US reciprocal tariff issues and domestic setbacks, both political, financial, and energy-related. ‘However, in the face of such pressures, our entrepreneurs continue to invest in sustainable infrastructure and practices, demonstrating extraordinary resilience and long-term vision,’ he added. According to apparel manufacturers, the move towards green factory buildings helped regain Bangladesh’s image after the Rana Plaza tragedy, which claimed 1,134 lives and left more than 2,000 injured.

The move came after angry workers of Nasa Basic Complex of Nassa Group blocked the Baipail-Abdullahpur road for three hours demanding payment of their overdue wages, said the police. The workers took to the street at around 8:30am halting traffic, said Mohammad Mominul Islam Bhuiya, superintendent of Industrial Police. The situation deteriorated after the protesters tried to force workers from nearby factories to express solidarity with their protest, prompting the authorities of 15 garment factories to declare holiday. The workers claimed that the authorities of the Nasa factory earlier declared a four-day holiday from August 10 without clearing salaries. After a four-day holiday, when the workers of the factory went to their respective workplace they found a four-day closure notice from Thursday, hanging at the main gate.

{"title": "New Age | Import of RMG raw materials rises by 9.9pc", "body": "The country’s imports of raw materials for the readymade garment sector witnessed a growth of 9.9 per cent in the financial year 2024-25, according to Bangladesh Bank data. According to the data, the country imported raw materials for the RMG sector, including raw cotton, yarn, staple, and other accessories, worth $18.44 billion. The amount was $16.78 billion in FY24. The central bank published the commodity-wise annual import data through the customs records. In FY25, Bangladesh earned $39.35 billion by exporting RMG products, the highest export-earning sector. This was an 8.84 per cent increase from $36.15 billion in FY24. The RMG sector accounted for more than 80 per cent of the country’s $48.28 billion worth of export earnings in FY25, said Export Promotion Bureau data. The net exports from the RMG sector totaled $20.91 billion in FY25, according to central bank data. Among the primary raw materials, raw cotton imports experienced a decline of 4.3 per cent to $3.46 billion, down from $ 3.60 billion in FY25. Bangladesh imported yarn worth $3.61 billion in FY25, 12.3 per cent higher than $3.22 billion in FY24. Textile and other related articles imports experienced a 16 per cent growth to $8.69 billion in FY25, up from $7.72 billion in FY24, according to the central bank data. Staple fibre imports stood at $1.53 billion, representing a 10 per cent increase from $1.39 billion in FY24. In FY25, the country imported dyeing and tanning materials worth $877 million, a 5.2 per cent increase from $833.7 million in FY24, according to Bangladesh Bank data. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association senior vice president Inamul Haq Khan told New Age that the values of exports, imports, and net exports demonstrated the stable situation of the country’s RMG sector. ‘The FY25 was an excellent year for us and we are hopeful that the current FY26 will also be a positive year,’ he added. The United States has recently revised the reciprocal tariff for Bangladesh to 20 per cent, almost the same as its major competitors, except for India, which has been slapped with a 50 per cent tariff. Inamul Haq expressed optimism that, for this reason, some orders might shift from India to Bangladesh. ‘Moreover, we are also in a good shape at European and other markets, so import of raw materials might increase in the current FY26,’ he added. He urged the government to address the domestic bottlenecks, including energy shortage, port and customs issues, ease of doing business, and banking issues, to ensure a better business environment. ‘If we get sufficient policy support, we have the ability to reach targets as we are getting better purchase orders,’ he added. However, the import of capital machinery experienced a negative growth of 19.1 per cent to $2.81 billion in FY25, compared to $3.48 billion in FY24, according to Bangladesh Bank data. The other capital goods import also experienced negative growth of 5.9 per cent to $6.7 billion from $7.15 billion in FY24. Exporters said that this decline was mainly due to political transition and uncertainty, which discouraged entrepreneurs from making new investments.

{"title": "New Age | Apparel exports to EU rise by 17.9pc in H1", "body": "Bangladesh cemented its position as the European Union’s second-largest apparel supplier in the first half of 2025 with exports up 17.9 per cent to 10.29 billion euros, but its growth was eclipsed by China’s 22.3 per cent rise and Cambodia’s 30.4 per cent surge, signalling severer competition in the EU market. According to Eurostat data released on Monday, EU apparel imports from Bangladesh rose to 10.29 billion euros in January–June 2025, up from €8.73 billion in the same period of 2024. Knitwear was the main driver, rising by 21.1 per cent to 6.03 billion euros, while woven garments increased by 13.6 per cent to 4.26 billion euros. Exporters said the higher growth showed that EU demand for garments was rising and the market there was improving, but they were concerned about growing competition among major producers following the US’s new tariffs on many Asian garment-producing countries. They said the high US tariffs, especially on India and China, had pushed these countries to focus more on the EU to make up for losses in the US market. The year started strongly, with exports in January 2025 reaching 1.91 billion euros, a 61 per cent rise from 1.19 billion euros in January 2024. February followed with 1.66 billion euros, 28 per cent higher than a year earlier, and in March exports rose further to 2.11 billion euros, an 18 percent increase. In April 2025, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the EU stood at 1.86 billion euros, just six per cent higher than April 2024. In May, exports fell to 1.42 billion euros, 11 per cent lower than the 1.59 billion euros of the previous year, marking the first monthly drop in the year. June saw a small recovery, with exports rising to 1.33 billion euros, 19 per cent higher year-on-year, although still slightly below May on a monthly basis. Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association former president Fazlul Hoque said the overall growth showed the market was improving, as almost all major producing countries had double-digit growth. He said that Bangladesh could do better if there was no internal problems, such as factory closures and banking difficulties, which had slowed further growth. Fazlu, also managing director of Plummy Fashions Ltd, said that because of trade tensions between China and the US, China was losing US market share. He warned that China was increasing its focus on the EU and would continue to do so, and that India would likely follow, making competition in the market very strong. When compared with other leading suppliers, Bangladesh’s growth in the first six months of 2025was higher than the EU’s overall apparel import expansion of 12.3 per cent. Data showed that the EU apparel imports increased to 43.39 billion euros in the first half of 2025, up from 38.64 billion euros in the same period of 2024. Knitwear led the gains with a 14.7 per cent rise to 21.87 billion euros, while woven apparel grew 10 per cent to 21.51 billion euros. Other competitors also showed solid improvements but did not match Bangladesh’s overall momentum. China reinforced its dominance as the EU’s largest supplier, with exports rising 22.3 per cent from 9.20 billion euros in H1 2024 to 11.26 billion euros in H1 2025. Cambodia led growth among major exporters, with EU apparel imports rising 30.4 per cent from 1.59 billion euros in H1 2024 to 2.07 billion euros in H1 2025. India increased its apparel exports to the EU by 15.4 per cent to 2.70 billion euros in January-June of 2025. Pakistan grew by 16.6 per cent to 1.86 billion euros, recording balanced gains across knit and woven segments. Vietnam maintained strong double-digit expansion, up 17.3 per cent to 2.02 billion euros, broadly in line with Bangladesh’s percentage increase. Turkey, traditionally an important supplier due to its geographical proximity, was the only major exporter to see a decline in the EU market. EU apparel imports in the first half of 2025 from Turkey fell by 7 per cent to 4.27 billion euros, with both knit and woven categories in contraction.

{"title": "New Age | BGMEA makes ‘Unit Price’ entry mandatory in UD", "body": "The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has urged its members to include the unit price of both imported raw materials and exportable readymade garment items when submitting utilisation declaration applications through its software, effective from September 1. In a letter to its members issued on Sunday, the industry body stated that the decision was made to ensure greater transparency, maintain international standards, and uphold the trust of global buyers in Bangladesh’s RMG products. In the letter, BGMEA stated that in many cases, UD applications were being submitted without specifying the unit price of raw materials, such as fabrics, and the finished apparel. ‘This practice has drawn concerns from international buyers, regulators, and particularly the National Board of Revenue, raising questions about accurate valuation of products,’ the letter read. To keep the RMG sector competitive and credible in global markets, mentioning the unit price in UD applications is now essential,’ BGMEA stated. ‘The new requirement would help ensure better monitoring, smooth operation of the industry, and strengthen Bangladesh’s position in the global apparel supply chain,’ the letter added. In Bangladesh›s garment industry, UD refers to a crucial customs document for RMG manufacturers and other export-oriented industries that import duty-free raw materials for production. The UD confirms that these imported raw materials have been used to produce export goods, enabling the company to fulfill its export orders and claim benefits, such as cash incentives. However, a manufacturer, requesting anonymity, said that mentioning the unit price could compromise their business privacy. ‘It only could possible if a two-factor or three-factor privacy system adopted, indicating a clear definition how many people and who can access the data,’ he added. Meanwhile, Md. Shehab Udduza Chowdhury, vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told New Age that they issued the letter with a view to identifying the value addition. ‘Once the database is completed, then they would suggest the members to focus more on value addition that volume,’ he added. He also said that to fulfill the information, it is mandatory to include the FoB value with UD. Regarding the privacy issue, he said that the value would added to the UD after placing the order, so there would not be any issues of privacy.

{"title": "New Age | BGMEA urges BB to address troubled banks’ limitations", "body": "The garment manufacturers in the country raised concerns on Tuesday over severe disruptions to their financial operations caused by several troubled banks, according to a press release. A delegation from the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, led by its president, Mahmud Hasan Khan, raised concerns during their meeting with Bangladesh Bank governor Ahsan H Mansur at the central bank›s headquarters. During the meeting, the BGMEA president explained the difficulties exporters were facing due to liquidity shortages in five struggling banks, the press release added. Despite the inflow of export proceeds, these banks have allegedly failed to release payments to exporters on time and are unable to open new letters of credit, he added. ‘This crisis has left many garment factories in serious financial distress, disrupting regular operations and exports. Most worryingly, factories are struggling to pay workers’ wages and allowances on time, fueling labour unrest that could escalate into a law-and-order issue,’ he added. He warned that the situation is tarnishing Bangladesh’s international image and eroding buyers’ confidence. ‘This is extremely damaging for the industry at a time when stability is critical,’ he added. BGMEA leaders expressed deep concern that, without immediate intervention, many companies could soon become sick industries, leading to mass layoffs and increasing the country’s largest export sector›s vulnerability. They urged the central bank to take swift and effective measures to resolve the crisis. Governor Mansur assured the delegation that their concerns would be addressed promptly. The central bank would make temporary arrangements to ensure the timely disbursement of exporters’ dues, thereby meeting their immediate financial needs, he added, stating that longer-term measures would follow to resolve the problem permanently. BGMEA vice-president Md Shehab Uddoza Chowdhury, directors Mohammad Abdur Rahim, Fahima Akter, and ABM Shamsuddin, along with other industry leaders were also present in the meeting.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to US rise to $5b in Jan-July", "body": "The country’s readymade garment exports to the United States experienced a robust growth of 21.68 per cent to $4.98 billion in the January-July period of 2025. According to the latest data published by the US Office of Textiles and Apparel, Bangladeshi exporters exported RMG items worth $4.09 billion in the same period of 2024. During the aforementioned period, Bangladesh outpaced almost all its major competitors in terms of export growth in the US, the country’s single largest export destination. Exporters said that the shift of orders from China to Bangladesh, due to the trade war with the US, has accelerated exports. They also stated that higher tariffs on China and competitor India might accelerate an increase in orders for the time being. In a single month of July, the US imported RMG items worth $729.86 million from Bangladesh, a 4.97 per cent higher from $695.27 million in July of 2024, the Otexa data stated. According to the Otexa data, the North American country imported apparel items worth $45.80 billion in January-July of 2025, a 4.98 per cent higher from $43.62 billion of the same period of 2024. In terms of volume, Bangladeshi RMG exports to the US also experienced positive growth of 20.34 per cent to 1.6 billion square metres in the first seven months of 2025, up from 1.33 billion square metres in the same period in 2024. As the third-largest supplier to the US, Bangladesh’s market share in the North American country stood at 10.11 per cent as of July 2025. Amid the ongoing trade war between the US and China, Vietnam remained the top exporter for the past several months, surpassing China. In January-July, Vietnam’s apparel exports grew by 16.97 per cent, reaching $9.46 billion, higher than $8.08 billion recorded in the mentioned period of 2024. Vietnam held a market share of 20.08 per cent. As the second-largest exporter, China further posted a negative growth of 21.07 per cent, reaching $6.92 billion in January-July of 2025, lower than $8.77 billion in the same period of 2024, and capturing a market share of 18.02 per cent. Followed by Bangladesh, India secured the fourth position in the US market with a market share of 6.32 per cent. The close competitor of Bangladesh bagged $3.3 billion in January-July of 2025, registering a 16.1 per cent growth from $2.85 billion in the first seven months of 2024, Otexa data stated. RMG exports from Indonesia and Cambodia were $2.67 billion and $2.37 billion in the January-July of 2025, with a market share of 5.59 per cent and 5.24 per cent, respectively, making them the fifth and sixth largest RMG suppliers to the US. On July 31, the Trump administration revised the reciprocal tariff on Bangladeshi goods to 20 per cent, following a series of discussions, which had been declared 35 per cent and 37 per cent earlier. Moreover, trade disputes with China remained unsettled while the Trump administration imposed a total of 50 per cent tariff on India, aimed at penalising the country for its continued imports of Russian oil. The manufacturers said that this shift has created some opportunities for Bangladesh’s RMG industry, as buyers might reconsider their sourcing strategies. Talking to New Age, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the exports to the US increased due to the shifting of orders from China. ‘China’s share and export to US market gradually declining due to trade war and tariff issues,’ he added, saying that the government should ensure policy supports. Former BGMEA director Mohiuddin Rubel said that US buyers have always trusted Bangladeshi products. ‘As Trump administration announced new tariff, we have opportunity to do better in the coming years,’ he added. However, he urged adequate policy support from the government and manufacturers to focus on diversified and high-value products. According to the OTEXA data, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the US in 2024 were $7.34 billion, and in 2023, it was $7.29 billion.

{"title": "New Age | RMG factories warned for defaulting wage loans", "body": "The government has issued a strong warning to factory owners who have failed to repay the interest-free loans provided to them for clearing workers’ arrears, said Labour and Employment adviser M Shakhawat Hossain. He also said that they would take strict legal action against defaulters. He was speaking at a high-level meeting at the Bangladesh Secretariat on Wednesday. M Sakhawat said that several leading industrial groups — including Beximco Group, Birds Group, TNZ Group, Dird Group, Niagara Textiles Ltd., Roar Fashion Ltd., Mahmud Jeans Ltd., Style Craft Ltd., and Goldstar Garments Ltd. — had received interest-free loans from the Finance Division and the Labour and Employment Ministry’s Central Fund to settle unpaid wages and prevent labour unrest. ‘However, many of these companies have failed to make repayments as per their agreements,’ he added. He also said that all dues must be cleared by December, and there would be no leniency. The adviser warned that the government would confiscate passports of defaulting owners and top executives, adding that steps are already underway to issue Interpol notices against absconding owners. Earlier, on September 2, the ministry decided to take initiative to issue Interpol red notice against the chairmen and managing directors of TNZ Group, Dird Group, and Roar Fashion Ltd. The ministry sent the application to the interpol to issue red notice though Police Headquarters, stating they violated labour law by staying abroad for a long time without paying the workers of their factories. He also instructed factory owners to engage with their lien banks to repay the loans by selling land, factories, or machinery if necessary. Moreover, he called on BGMEA and BKMEA to act as mediators to ensure the funds were recovered in a timely manner. Senior officials from the finance ministry attended the meeting, including the Financial Institutions Division, Bangladesh Bank, the president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, and owners of the concerned factories.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to EU surge 48pc in 5 years", "body": "But tougher competition looms The country’s readymade garment exports to the European Union witnessed a sustained growth of 48.34 per cent between 2020 and 2024, reaching 18.79 billion euros, cementing its position as Europe’s second-largest supplier. According to data from Eurostat, in 2020, Bangladesh exported 12.32 billion euros worth of RMG to the EU, the largest export destination of the country, which rose to 18.28 billion euros by 2024, outpacing overall global export growth to the region. During the same period, Europe’s total apparel imports from global suppliers climbed by 24.92 per cent from 68.48 billion euros in 2020 to 85.55 billion euros in 2024, showing rising demand despite global uncertainties. Among the major suppliers, China remained the EU’s top apparel source, followed by Bangladesh, Turkey, India, and Vietnam. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told New Age that over the past five years, Bangladesh’s exports to EU countries have grown steadily. ‘This growth has been largely driven by rising demand among European consumers for Bangladeshi apparel and the country’s ability to maintain competitive prices,’ he added. However, he warned that sustaining this momentum would not be easy, as Bangladesh’s exports have already reached near-peak levels. At the same time, buyers’ expectations in the European market are shifting rapidly — particularly when it comes to sustainable production and supply chain transparency, he added. In 2021, Bangladesh exported RMG worth 14.29 billion euros, which climbed to 21.91 billion euros in 2022. However, due to economic sluggishness across Europe due to the Ukraine-Russia war, the export declined to 17.44 billion euros in 2023, which further surged to 18.28 billion euros in 2024. ‘About 50 per cent of our total RMG export is bounded to EU, which is good thing, but there might be challenges also,’ said Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. He also warned that Bangladesh has to adapt to EU due diligence and challenges after the post-LDC era. The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive was passed by the European Parliament on 24 April 2024, aiming to enforce human rights and environmental safeguards across corporate supply chains. The EU is now preparing to implement a series of new policies, including the CSDDD, the Green Deal, and the Digital Product Passport. These measures would require major European brands to identify and address human rights, worker safety, and environmental risks across their entire supply chains, which might impact Bangladesh’s RMG sector. Recognising this, Mohammad Hatem said that the government, industry associations, and development partners have already begun preparing. ‘We have taken initiatives including drafting a national action plan for the labour sector, amending the Bangladesh Labour Act, enhancing worker skills with support from the ILO and development partners, strengthening factory safety,’ he added. He also said that many exporters are obtaining internationally recognized certifications and rolling out digital systems to improve supply chain traceability. Currently, Bangladesh has 263 United States Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications, where 111 are platinum-rated, 133 are gold-rated, 15 are silver-rated, and four are certified. Along with a modest GDP growth forecast, in July 2025, the euro zone annual inflation remained stable at 2 per cent, meaning consumers’ ability to spend more on fashion. However, the competitors like China and India have been hit with US tariffs, where negotiations with China are still ongoing, and India was slammed with a 50 per cent tariff, including a penalty. Exporters said that high US tariffs have prompted suppliers like China and India to incrementally raise their concentration in the EU countries. The trade race might intensify further in the days ahead, especially following the new US tariff regime, they warned. Hatem stressed that to stay ahead, Bangladeshi exporters must focus on sustainable production and environmentally friendly processes to win buyers’ trust. Moreover, the country must also focus on higher-value and design-driven products. Rubel said Bangladesh must adapt to what the EU demands, including developing local backward linkage industries, logistics support, government policies, and others. They also said that the government must support this transformation by offering policy incentives, tax breaks, and encouraging green investment.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exporters seek clarity on US tariffs", "body": "Bangladesh’s readymade garment exporters have sought detailed clarification and an implementation mechanism regarding a recent United States executive order that allows a 20 per cent reciprocal tariff on Bangladeshi goods to be reduced if at least 20 per cent US-origin content or raw materials are used. The issue was discussed on Monday during a meeting between a visiting US Trade Representative delegation and the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association at the US Embassy in Dhaka. BGMEA president Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu and Brendan Lynch, USTR assistant representative for South and Central Asia, led the talks. A three-member USTR team arrived in Dhaka on Sunday for a two-day visit to follow up on earlier discussions in Washington and to review a draft trade agreement with Bangladesh. After the meeting, Mahmud Hasan Khan told New Age that exporters sought clarity on ‘the valuation and traceability mechanisms to determine US input content.’ In response, the US delegation said that US Customs was finalising the process within the stipulated timeframe. According to clause F of section 3 of the US Executive Order 14257, issued on April 2, if an export to the US contains 20 per cent or more US-origin content, the reciprocal tariff would not apply to that portion. For instance, if an apparel item worth $100 includes 26 per cent US materials, the duty would only be imposed on the remaining $74. The BGMEA president said that exporters also urged the US to adopt a ‘stacking method’ to adjust duties in line with other imports, which would reduce tariff burdens and enhance Bangladesh’s competitiveness. ‘However, only the EU currently enjoys such a facility, and while the US advised us to apply, they gave no major assurance,’ he added. Under stacking tariffs, multiple duties—such as the MFN rate and reciprocal tariffs—are applied sequentially on duty-inclusive values, which raises the effective rate beyond a flat calculation. Exporters want a harmonised formula where all duties are calculated on the base value to keep rates closer to a weighted average. Despite securing a 20 per cent reciprocal tariff facility, Bangladesh’s exports to the US still face an effective duty rate of about 36.5 per cent, including the average 16.5 per cent MFN tariff. ‘This remains a major challenge for our apparel exports,’ Mahmud Hasan said, urging the USTR to consider deeper tariff cuts. On labour law reforms, Lynch stressed that amendments to Bangladesh’s Labour Act should align with international standards and ILO guidelines. The BGMEA president assured that consultations with 81 trade unions were already underway to ensure practical and inclusive reforms that safeguard both jobs and industrial growth. He added that the US delegation expressed satisfaction with the discussions and optimism about lowering tariffs as bilateral trade expands. Mahmud Hasan also said that Bangladesh would import more US cotton to help reduce the trade deficit. Several BGMEA leaders were also present at the meeting.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to major markets see growth", "body": "The country’s readymade garment exports to its major destinations witnessed a moderate growth in the July-August period of the current financial year of 2025-26. According to the country-wise detailed export data from the Export Promotion Bureau, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $7.13 billion in July-August of FY26, an increase of 9.63 per cent from $6.50 billion in the same period of FY25. Apparel exporters said that thanks to the growing demands of brands and retailers, export earnings maintained a growth momentum. According to the EPB data, in the July-August period of FY26, Bangladesh secured $3.4 billion from European Union countries, the largest market for Bangladeshi manufacturers. The earnings are 6.6 per cent higher than the $3.19 billion earned in the same period of FY25. The export earnings from the EU accounted for 47.82 per cent of the total earnings. Export earnings from the United States witnessed a robust growth of 12.33 per cent to $1.44 billion, up from $1.28 billion in the July-August period of FY25, defying the tariff fears. The US, the largest single-country destination for Bangladeshi exporters, represented a 20.30 per cent share of the total earnings. Fetching a strong positive growth of 15.51 per cent, Bangladeshi apparel exporters earned $882.62 million in July-August of FY26 from the United Kingdom, up from $764.8 billion in the same period of FY25, the EPB data showed. From Canada, the RMG sector earned $241.8 million in July-August of FY26, 13.69 per cent more than the $212.68 million earned in the same period of FY25. In July-August of FY26, Germany remained the largest export destination among EU countries, from which Bangladeshi RMG manufacturers secured $797.71 million. However, the earnings witnessed a slight decline of 1.53 per cent from $810.13 million in the same period of FY25, showed the EPB data compiled by the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange, a private initiative working to promote the apparel and textile industry in Bangladesh. The export earnings from Spain stood at $721.29 million, France at $320.84 million, Italy at $232.02 million, Poland at $290.68 million and the Netherlands at $405.44 million. Regarding apparel exports, countries like the US, Canada, the UK, and the EU are considered traditional markets, while other countries are deemed non-traditional ones. Japan, Australia, Russia, India, China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico are major non-traditional export destinations. Export earnings from the non-traditional market also demonstrated positive growth, with an overall surge of 10.44 per cent reaching $1.14 billion, which was $1.04 billion in the same period of FY25. The non-traditional market represented 16.11 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports. Among these markets, Japan led with imports worth $224.19 million from Bangladesh, followed by India at $144.21 million, Australia at $141.10 million, and South Korea at $78.84 million. However, exports to Australia experienced a decline of 6.43 per cent. RMG exports to Turkey and Mexico also witnessed significant earnings, amounting to $51 million and $53 million, respectively, in the July-August period of FY26. Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that Bangladesh’s current growth in exports significantly depended on the EU and the US. The moderate growth in the non-traditional market underscores the importance of further research and focus in this category, as it possesses substantial growth potential, which will also help balance reliance on traditional markets, he added.

Total shipments in July rose to €1.68 billion, up 7.05 per cent year-on-year, significantly lower than June’s 20.57 per cent surge to €1.35 billion, according to Eurostat data released on Monday. Knitwear remained the leading export driver, earning €1.06 billion in July 2025, compared with €974 million in the same month of 2024 — an 8.61 per cent rise. Woven apparel also grew, though at a slower pace, with exports increasing 4.48 per cent year-on-year to €618 million. Country’s apparel exporters described the July slowdown in the EU market as worrying. For the first seven months of 2025, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the EU reached €11.99 billion, a 16.45 per cent increase on the €10.29 billion recorded in the same period of 2024. Knitwear accounted for €7.1 billion, while woven apparel contributed €4.88 billion in January–July 2025. In January-July of 2025, China retained its position as the EU’s largest apparel exporter, shipping goods worth €14.06 billion, a 23 per cent increase on last year, data showed. ‘In these seven months, Bangladesh has achieved 12 per cent growth, but China has posted 23 per cent in the EU market. That shows how strong China is – and this should be a matter of serious concern for us,’ former Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Fazlul Hoque told New Age on Tuesday. He said that China’s surge in EU apparel shipments had come against the backdrop of declining sales to the United States, which had prompted Chinese exporters to redirect capacity to Europe. Fazlu, also the managing director of Plummy Fashion, said that China’s ability to increase market share in any destination demonstrated its strength to outcompete rivals. ‘We may have some advantages in the US market, but that is no reason to be complacent. For the EU, we must improve our productivity and competitiveness,’ he said. Fazlu warned that rising business costs were already undermining exporters, saying that port handling charges had been increased by 41 per cent that week, which added further strain to manufacturers already grappling with gas and electricity shortages. ‘In such difficult times, measures that raise costs only weaken our competitiveness,’ he cautioned, urging the government to provide stable utility services and resist imposing additional charges. The industry leader also called for a two-pronged strategy, emphasising the need to enhance productivity at factory level and to accelerate product diversification within the garment sector in order to sustain the growth rate in the EU market. Eurostat data showed that the EU’s appetite for clothing surged in the first seven months of 2025, with imports climbing to a record €51.9 billion, up from €46.3 billion — a 12.17 per cent increase over the same period last year. Turkey, by contrast, experienced a decline in shipments to the EU, with total exports falling to €5.05 billion from €5.46 billion a year earlier. India’s apparel exports to the EU grew steadily to €3.13 billion, up from €2.74 billion — a rise of 14.14 per cent. Pakistan saw moderate gains, with exports increasing by 14.74 per cent to €2.21 billion. Cambodia emerged as a standout, recording a striking 30.18 per cent growth in EU exports to €2.48 billion. Indonesia, despite smaller in scale, posted steady growth with €590 million in exports, an 8.71 per cent increase in 2024.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh likely to import 8.1m bales of cotton in 2025-26: USDA", "body": "Bangladesh, the second-largest exporter of readymade garment items, is likely to import 8.1 million bales of cotton in the marketing year 2025-26 as the world’s largest raw cotton importer. According to recently published data by the United States Department of Agriculture titled ‘Cotton: World Markets and Trade’, the cotton consumption of Bangladesh is expected to remain the same at 8.1 million, which was forecast in August. However, the consumption forecast slightly declined from 8.4 million bales, which was forecasted in July of this year. USDA data showed that in MY25, Bangladesh’s imports of cotton were also at 8.1 million bales, which was 7.57 million bales in MY24 and 7 million bales in MY23. Earlier in July, the consumption forecast for Bangladesh was lowered by 3 lakh bales due to lower consumption expectations. Vietnam, one of Bangladesh’s closest competitors in RMG exports, is also projected to import 8.1 million bales of cotton in MY26. Outpacing China, Pakistan might become the third largest importer of cotton in MY26, by importing 5.9 million bales, where China is expected to import 5.2 million bales. Bangladesh was the world’s top cotton importer in the previous years also. Meanwhile, on March 31, the USDA, in its report titled ‘Cotton and Products Annual’, stated that Bangladesh’s cotton imports would witness a slight increase in MY26 thanks to increasing demand for RMG items. According to the Export Promotion Bureau’s data, in FY25, Bangladesh’s RMG exports experienced a positive year-on-year growth of 8.84 per cent to $39.35 billion. In MY24, West African cotton held the largest market share in Bangladesh (37 per cent), while other major exporters included Brazil (17 per cent), India (23 per cent), and the United States (9 per cent). However, the scenario for the US might witness a significant change as Bangladesh is expected to import more cotton from the US. As part of its tariff negotiations, Bangladesh is expected to increase imports of cotton from the US. The US imposed a reciprocal tariff of 37 per cent on Bangladesh in April, which was subsequently lowered to 35 per cent on July 8 and further reduced to 20 per cent on July 31 following a series of negotiations. A delegation of the US Trade Representative visited Bangladesh on Sunday and Monday. After meeting with the USTR, commerce adviser Sk Bashir Uddin stated that they are attempting to reduce the existing trade gap with the USA by importing energy and agricultural products, such as cotton, soybeans, and wheat. He also said that Bangladesh could meet only 2 per cent of its overall cotton demand through local production, while the remaining 98 per cent of cotton needs to be imported. Earlier, the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association President Showkat Aziz Russell said that they intend to import cotton worth of $1 billion from the US as part of efforts to reduce the trade imbalance between the two countries. In 2023, Bangladesh lifted the double fumigation requirement for US cotton, allowing US cotton to enter Bangladesh without fumigation at the port of entry. These changes saved importers millions of dollars and five days of waiting time. According to the USDA report, global production of cotton has increased by more than 1 million bales to 117.7 million as larger crops in China, India, and Australia. China’s production is forecast to increase by 1 million bales to 32.5 million, if realised, the largest crop in 12 years. According to the USDA, Bangladeshis could produce approximately 153,000 bales of cotton on 45,000 hectares of land, which accounts for less than 2 per cent of its total consumption.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to US, EU post strong growth in 10 years", "body": "Sustaining growth may be challenging in future, experts warn Bangladesh’s readymade garment exports to both the European Union countries and the United States posted robust growth over the past decade, between 2015 and 2024, according to official data from the respective markets. According to the Office of Textiles and Apparel, Bangladesh’s RMG export to the US — the largest single-country destination for the country — surged by 35.87 per cent to $7.34 billion in 2024 from $5.4 billion in 2015. The growth trend remained consistent throughout the decade, reflecting the strength of Bangladesh’s apparel industry on the US market. Similarly, Eurostat data show that RMG exports to the EU — the largest overall market for Bangladeshi apparel — jumped 58.45 per cent to $18.27 billion in 2024 from $11.53 billion in 2015. The EU market also demonstrated sustained growth throughout the ten-year period. Industry insiders noted that the decade-long growth was steady, except in 2020, when global apparel trade experienced a sharp decline due to the Covid pandemic. The highest export of the RMG products to the US and EU from Bangladesh were $9.72 billion in 2022 and $21.92 billion in the same year respectively. Industry insiders attributed the strong performance to competitive labour costs, large-scale production capacity and growing buyer confidence in Bangladesh’s apparel sector. However, they cautioned, innovation, design diversification and sustainability practices will be crucial for maintaining this growth momentum in the coming years, especially amid possible shifts in global trade policies, potential US tariff measures and rising competition on the EU market. During the decade, the overall import of the RMG products by the US witnessed a decline of 6.93 per cent to $79.25 billion in 2024, from $85.15 billion in 2015. For the EU countries, the import of RMG items from their global suppliers reached $85.51 billion, a robust 20.47 per cent higher than $71.01 billion in 2015, according to Eurostat data. In the US, Bangladesh secured its position as the third highest apparel exporter over the decade, while China remained the top and Vietnam was the second highest exporter. Moreover, in the EU, Bangladesh was the second-highest apparel exporter after China, followed by its competitors Turkey, India and Vietnam. The decade-long rise in apparel exports to the EU and US has significantly strengthened Bangladesh’s foreign exchange earnings, with the sector now contributing over 80 per cent of the country’s total export receipts. Over the decade, the US imported $30.5 billion worth of RMG items from China, which witnessed a sharp decline of 46 per cent to $16.5 billion, due to trade conflict between the countries. From Vietnam, the US’ apparel imports was $10.56 billion in 2015, which surged by 42 per cent to $15 billion in 2024. The US RMG imports from India and Indonesia were $3.66 billion and $4.94 billion in 2015, which soared to $4.7 billion and $4.25 billion in 2024 respectively. The EU’s RMG imports from China witnessed a 4.14 per cent decline $24.06 billion in 2024, which was $25.1 billion in 2015. The import from Turkey stood at $9.31 billion in 2024, which was 19.6 per cent higher than $7.78 billion in 2015. The RMG imports from India and Vietnam were $4.18 billion and $3.98 billion in 2024, which were $3.9 billion and $2.31 billion respectively. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, told New Age that over the past decade, Bangladesh’s apparel exports to Europe and the United States had grown steadily, driven by rising demand from European consumers and our ability to maintain competitive pricing. ‘However, sustaining this growth will become increasingly challenging as our export capacity nears saturation,’ he added. Moreover, the EU is implementing key regulatory initiatives such as Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, European Green Deal and Digital Product Passport. ‘These require European buyers to identify and address human rights, labour and environmental risks throughout their supply chains, significantly impacting Bangladesh’s apparel sector,’ he added. Meanwhile, US tariffs on Chinese and Indian products have encouraged some manufacturers to relocate production to Bangladesh, offering growth opportunities. However, this has also intensified competition on the European market as Chinese and Indian suppliers increase their focus there, he added. Relying solely on low costs is no longer sustainable in this complex landscape, he added. The government must provide policy support, tax incentives and promote green investments alongside stronger trade diplomacy with the EU and the US, he added. Recently, the US administration imposed a 20-per cent reciprocal tariff on Bangladeshi exporting goods, lowered from earlier declared 35 per cent and 37 per cent. Talking to New Age, Inamul Haq Khan, senior vice-president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that due to competitive labour cost, price, and establishment, Bangladesh had been getting more orders. ‘Our production system is more mature than any other manufacturing country, which keeps us ahead and assists us to get buyers’ confidence,’ he added. He also stated that due to US tariffs on competitors, Bangladesh was receiving more orders as they were shifting from China and even many Chinese entrepreneurs had begun to establish facilities in Bangladesh. ‘The competition on the US market might see an increase, but we could do well through government policy supports, innovation, and high-value products,’ he added. Mohiuddin Rubel, former BGMEA director, noted that although growth was good in both the US and the EU, some issues in the US had made the market concerning. ‘If such challenges were to arrive at the EU, then we must suffer. The scenario of global trade is changing frequently, so we have to focus on new markets, high-value products,’ he added. Recently, Research and Policy Integration for Development chair MA Razzaque said that the reciprocal tariffs might shrink imports and contract markets of the US by 12 per cent or $10 billion, potentially reducing Bangladesh’s exports to the US by up to 14 per cent, or $1.25 billion — including $1.08 billion in RMG — over the next year. He also said that it might accelerate competition in the EU.

{"title": "New Age | Tariff uncertainty delays World Cup orders for China’s merch makers", "body": "Tariff fears are hurting World Cup merchandise orders at Shang Yabing’s Chinese knitwear factory, where racks of scarves bear the logos of national teams from Ireland to Tanzania. Manufacturers in China’s export hub Yiwu would normally already be inundated with World Cup orders ahead of next summer’s football tournament, this time hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada. But a rollercoaster ride of a trade war between Washington and Beijing is making international buyers think twice before placing orders with companies like Shang’s Yiwu Wells Knitting Product. When AFP visited his bustling workrooms, Shang was overseeing rows of colleagues adding the finishing touches to a plethora of sports-themed accessories. ‘We’ve been in this industry for over 10 years, and we’ve produced World Cup-related merchandise for nearly every tournament in that time,’ Shang said. ‘This year, we’ve secured some smaller orders, but the larger ones that were on hold before haven’t materialised yet... this is likely because of the US tariffs,’ he added. At the factory on Thursday, crates overflowing with colourful wares surrounded employees’ workstations. Some workers used sewing machines to attach fringe trims to the ends of scarves, while another ironed green and yellow lengths of fabric emblazoned with the word ‘Australian’. China and the United States have extended a temporary truce, staving off triple-digit tariffs on each other’s goods until November, but the two sides continue to spar over semiconductors and TikTok. With a little under nine months to go before the World Cup, Shang said the company was still waiting for clients to approve substantial orders amounting to around a million pieces. Along the fluorescent-lit hallways of Yiwu’s sprawling International Trade City, one of the world’s largest wholesale markets, stores offering soccer balls and flags were relatively quiet compared to the rush of foreign buyers the sales hub sees during peak periods. Vendors displayed everything from flag-printed sunglasses to miniature football cleats hanging on keychains. ‘By this point before the last World Cup, we saw a huge influx of orders,’ Daisy Dai, a seller of printed soccer balls, told AFP. This year, she said, ‘customers are holding back’. American buyers previously made up a large part of Dai’s clientele but ‘since the start of the trade war a number of large brands stopped ordering, because of a lack of clarity on tariffs’. Zhou Yanjuan, a seller of flags and World Cup-themed souvenirs, told AFP that shipments abroad had slowed for her. ‘We’re not selling necessities after all,’ Zhou said. Still, she was optimistic that ‘things will gradually improve going forward’. ‘Everyone’s probably waiting for (tariffs) to be adjusted downward,’ Zhou said. ‘That could make things a little easier for us.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/276647/tariff-uncertainty-delays-world-cup-orders-for-chinas-merch-makers", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 474}

The Ministry of Labour and Employment came up with the information at a press release signed by ministry public relations officer Abdul Malek on Saturday. According to the release, the NASSA Group chairman has signed important documents related to the draft power of attorney for selling assets to clear workers’ dues. The properties include Plot-6 on Road 7 in Gulshan, a seven-storey building covering an area of 2,06,000 square feet at Taiyabpur mouza in Ashulia, another piece of land covering five bigha, also a 10-bigha plot at Char Chengakandi mouza in Narayanganj, a plot bought from Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha and shares worth about Tk 86 crore. The conglomerate’s officials said that with the signing of the draft power of attorney, other procedures for the sale of assets would soon be completed, ensuring timely payment of workers’ arrears, said the release. The Anti-Corruption Commission in February this year filed a case against its chairman Nazrul Islam on charges of illegally acquiring wealth worth over Tk 781.31 crore. Nazrul, who founded NASSA Group in 1990 and was a former chairman of EXIM Bank, led the Bangladesh Association of Banks for nearly 17 years during the Awami League-led regime since 2008. After the fall of the AL regime Bangladesh Bank removed him and his wife Nasreen Islam from the EXIM Bank board on August 29, 2024 and he was later arrested on October 2. Nazrul was placed on remand in various cases filed on different charges, including murder during the July uprising. He is now in jail.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh targets growth in Japan’s RMG market", "body": "Bangladesh’s readymade garment exporters envision Japan as a key growth destination, aiming to expand their footprint in one of the largest apparel markets outside traditional buyers. Despite Japan being the third-largest RMG importer globally, Bangladesh’s share remains modest, presenting both challenges and opportunities for the industry. According to International Trade Centre data, Japan imported RMG worth around $23 billion from global sources in 2024, with only $1.2 billion, or 5.5 per cent, coming from Bangladesh. Industry insiders noted that Japanese sourcing companies prioritise cost efficiency, quality, agility, trendiness, and shorter lead times, along with consistent communication with buyers. Meeting these criteria, they argued, could help Bangladeshi manufacturers significantly expand their market share. Bangladesh’s exports to Japan have shown steady growth over the past five years, rising from $944.82 million in the financial year 2020-21 to $1.19 billion in FY25, according to data from the Export Promotion Bureau. In FY22, the exports were $1.10 billion, in FY23, $1.6 billion, and in FY24, it was $1.09 billion. While progress is visible, Bangladesh still lags behind major competitors in the Japanese market, such as China and Vietnam, which exported approximately $14 billion and $4 billion, with market shares of over 55 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively, in 2024. Other notable suppliers include Cambodia and Indonesia, each exporting around $1 billion, according to provisional data from an unofficial source, as detailed official data has yet to be published. Bangladeshi apparel exporters said that if the ongoing negotiations for the Japan-Bangladesh Economic Partnership Agreement is materialised, the country’s exports to Japan might witness a major jump. ‘We have been working to increase exports to Japan for more than a decade,’ Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association. He told New Age that Japan is a potential market; if the EPA is signed, the export might increase sharply to the destination. Meanwhile, the seventh round of negotiations for the Japan-Bangladesh EPA was held in Tokyo from September 3 to 12, with the presence of the officials from both sides. In that round of negotiations, both sides had fruitful discussions on the way forward for future negotiations and on negotiating areas such as trade in goods, rules of origin, trade in services, investment, electronic commerce, and intellectual property, according to commerce ministry officials. Mahbubur Rahman, secretary of the Ministry of Commerce, said that the EPA negotiations with Japan are expected to be finished within this month or next, and then a situation of signing the agreement would emerge. The country›s apparel manufacturers stated that Japanese buyers are particularly attentive to quality, innovation, transparency, and professionalism. Envoy Textiles Ltd is one of the major Bangladeshi suppliers to the prominent Japanese fast-retailing brand Uniqlo. Kutubuddin Ahmed, the founder and chairman of Envoy Textiles Ltd, the world’s first LEED Platinum-certified denim mill, said that when doing business with Japanese buyers, the first condition is that the manufacturers must be honest and transparent with them. ‘Japanese buyers usually take time before placing orders, as they want to be completely sure of a supplier’s honesty and transparency in every aspect, including raw materials such as cotton and chemicals, as well as the entire work process,’ he added. He also said that they are very particular about product quality, working environment, innovation, and professional behaviour. Japanese buyers do not abruptly leave a supplier, he added, saying, ‘We have a strong business relationship with Marubeni and Uniqlo, and we are working to further increase the volume.’ Mohammad Hatem said that to capture the Japanese market, research and development, design, and understanding of trends are major factors. ‘We need a government-initiated or trade bodies-set R&D cell which is dedicated to researching the demands, trends, challenges, and potentials of the buyer countries,’ he added. Echoing a similar sentiment, Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that there are some challenges, including huge investment in R&D, maintaining shipment time, and capturing the fast-changing fashion trends of Japan. ‘Diversifying our market focus beyond Europe and the USA to include nontraditional markets like Japan would present a strategic opportunity to reduce reliance on traditional trade partners,’ he added. He also said that expanding into Japan›s fashion-forward and quality-conscious market could open new avenues for growth and success. According to the EPB data, Bangladesh’s overall export to Japan in FY25 was $1.41 billion, which was $1.31 billion in FY24.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to India on rise", "body": "The exports of readymade garments to India maintained a positive growth trend over the past three months despite trade restrictions imposed in May. According to data from the Export Promotion Bureau, Bangladesh exported RMG items to India worth $184 million in June-August 2025, which was approximately $160 million in the same period of 2024, indicating a 15 per cent growth in exports. During the period, export earnings from the RMG sector were $81.3 million in August of this year, which was $69 million in August of 2024. The RMG export to India stood at $62.91 million in July of this year, which was $52.67 million in July 2024, and the country bagged $40 million in June of 2025, which was $37.1 million in June of 2024, the EPB data stated. Earlier on May 17. India imposed restrictions on imports of some products, including RMG, through land ports, leaving only Mumbai’s Nhava Sheva and Kolkata ports open. Exporters must now send goods through Chattogram seaport then via Colombo port in Sri Lanka before reaching Nhava Sheva, involving four rounds of container handling, raising both cost and lead time. Meanwhile, since the ousting of the Awami League regime and Sheikh Hasina’s flight to India in August 2024 in the face of a mass uprising, the bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh has witnessed a series of restrictions. The RMG exporters stated that, despite the restrictions, Indian buyers might still enjoy a competitive advantage by sourcing from Bangladesh due to duty-free market access. Moreover, several global brands with operations in India source from Bangladeshi factories, which also might be a reason behind the growth trend. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that the growth in apparel exports to India is a very positive sign. ‘Although the restrictions mean it takes longer to ship goods by sea, the route remains cost-effective. As a result, the impact on exports has been minimal,’ he added. The overall exports to India reached $411.33 million in the past three months, although decreased slightly by 5 per cent, mostly due to June exports. The export earnings in June were $100 million, in July were $147.19 million, and in August were $164.14 million, the EPB data stated. However, the overall export trend in July and August 2025 started to return to a positive direction, as the country recorded $143 million in July and $160 million in August 2024. Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that although India is one of Bangladesh’s major competitors, it also sources from Bangladesh to meet the local demand. ‘India has a large population, meaning a large domestic market. Moreover, they might also moving towards value-added production, which might made Bangladesh as price competitive for their local market,’ he added.’ Beside Bangladesh’s largest buyer Trent Limited, a subsidiary of the Tata Group, major global retailers include H&M, Levi Strauss, Marks & Spencer, Puma, Uniqlo, Decathlon, Pepe Jeans, and Bestseller, also source apparel from Bangladesh for the Indian market. ‘The global brands might have the contracts with Bangladeshi manufacturers, which impacted the RMG exports to India from Bangladesh,’ he added. If there were no trade tensions and restrictions between Bangladesh and India, the export would have witnessed more growth, he added. In FY25, India imported RMG items worth $644.24 million from Bangladesh. On August 11, India imposed a ban on imports of several jute products and ropes through land ports, after June 27, when they also banned imports of several jute and woven products through land ports. Earlier, on May 17, India imposed restrictions on the import of most Bangladeshi products, including RMG, processed foods, and agro-products. On April 9, India withdrew the trans-shipment facility it had granted to Bangladesh for exporting various items to the Middle East, Europe, and various other countries except Nepal and Bhutan.

{"title": "New Age | Trump’s granddaughter launches clothing brand", "body": "US president Donald Trump’s granddaughter has unveiled a clothing brand bearing her name, with promotional photos taken at the White House featuring the teen in a $130 sweatshirt. Don Jr’s daughter stood near the 79-year-old Republican on Friday wearing one of her brand’s pullovers, as he answered reporters’ questions outside the White House. ‘This is Kai, by the way,’ he told the Washington press corps, introducing his 18-year-old granddaughter who had given a short speech at last year’s Republican National Convention. The pair, both keen golfers, then boarded a helicopter as they headed off to attend the sport’s Ryder Cup competition. The eldest of the US president’s grandchildren, who is expected to join the golf team at the University of Miami next year, announced the launch of her clothing brand on social media Thursday. A website selling the brand’s $130 sweatshirts — plain crew necks with her initials on the chest and her signature at the cuff — features photos of her wearing them while posing on the White House grounds. Kai’s parents are divorced, and her mother is reportedly dating golf legend Tiger Woods. Unlike previous officeholders, the current president of the United States is known for selling a wide variety of self-branded merchandise. The billionaire is regularly accused of using his position to promote the Trump family’s financial interests, particularly in real estate or cryptocurrencies.

{"title": "New Age | RMG non-traditional markets stagnate despite push", "body": "Bangladesh’s ready-made garment manufacturers have long emphasised expansion into non-traditional markets, but export earnings from those destinations have barely budged over the past five years. According to the Export Promotion Bureau data, RMG export earnings to non-traditional markets stood at $5.08 billion in the financial year 2020-21 and reached $6.44 billion in FY25. According to the EPB data, RMG export earnings from non-traditional markets were $6.37 billion in FY22, $8.37 billion in FY23, and $6.09 billion in FY24. The earnings from the non-traditional market represented approximately 14 per cent–16 per cent of the total RMG exports. Industry insiders said that purchasing orders for small quantities, a lack of proper market analyses, research, and exporters’ West-centric mentality are responsible for this stagnation. They also said that although efforts continue, they face myriad challenges in those markets, including changing trade trends and tariff regimes, as well as regulatory hurdles in dozens of destination countries. In the context of Bangladesh›s RMG exports, non-traditional markets include Japan, Australia, India, China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, and several other countries. The United States, countries of the European Union, the United Kingdom, and Canada are regarded as traditional markets. Exporters stated that focusing on the non-traditional markets is all the more crucial now, in light of evolving global trade dynamics, the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States on Bangladesh’s exports, and the impending graduation from the status of a least developed country. Under the US reciprocal tariff regime, Bangladesh initially faced a 37 per cent duty rate on its exports. Later, a 35 per cent rate was announced, though further negotiations reduced it to 20 per cent. Moreover, Bangladesh is slated to graduate from the LDC category in November 2026, making formalisation of trade relations and diversification of markets ever more pressing. Speaking to New Age, Kutubuddin Ahmed, founder and chairman of Envoy Textiles Ltd., said that they are primarily focused on two major markets—the EU and the US—due to the high order volumes. He also said that small-quantity orders are not viable unless buyers are willing to pay higher prices, as the cost of producing smaller orders is higher than that of bulk production. ‘Most factories are not prepared to handle small-quantity orders, while new markets usually begin with smaller volumes,’ he added. He also said that the sector also lacks adequate research on new markets—particularly regarding customer culture, fashion trends, and weather conditions. Currently, most business is done by following buyer-provided samples, which he described as ‘copying their designs.’ On the other hand, Bangladesh lacks state-level market research initiatives, whereas China undertakes such efforts at the national level. Ahmed also warned that without proper market research and diversification, Bangladeshi enterprises would face significant challenges after the country’s graduation from LDC status. According to the EPB data, earnings from the non-traditional market stood at $6.44 billion in FY25, which accounted for 16.36 percent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports. Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, stated that Bangladesh’s exports to non-traditional markets are stagnant primarily due to a lack of proper research and analysis. ‘We also have a West-centric mentality, for which a number of exporters are reluctant to research the trends and demands of the nontraditional market destinations,’ he added. He also said that the major portion of the exporters heavily rely on third-party buying houses, and the buying houses couldn’t conduct any proper research on market diversification. ‘The association and the government must step up in this regard. The government should enact all missions and embassies in nontraditional markets to keep contributing,’ he added. There are many challenges, including different tariff regimes and varying trends and choices, he added, noting that the government and the sector must identify the major barriers. ‘The barriers might be financial, tariff-related, design-related, or even lead time-related. We have to work on these specifically,’ he added. Earlier, BGMEA president Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu told New Age that they have been working to increase their exports for over a decade. ‘However, as a single market, each destination is comparatively small and there are also tariff-related and other challenges in those markets,’ he added. Many insiders believe that if exporters can export RMG items worth $10 billion to non-traditional markets in the coming years, it could alleviate their overreliance on the US market, which has already become saturated. The manufacturers stated that there are also some challenges in non-traditional markets, including payment issues with Russia, land port issues with India, and design issues in the Middle East. Moreover, there are also challenges, such as a complex tariff regime. ‘Although Bangladesh imports cotton from Brazil with zero duty, the RMG products face a 30 per cent-35 per cent tariff in the Brazilian market,’ said Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu. He also stated that if they urged a duty waiver, Brazil would seek to export meat to Bangladesh, which is almost impossible given the current agricultural situation in Bangladesh. He also mentioned that there are some design and branding-related issues associated with exporting to the Middle East. To address the challenges, they urged the exporters to focus on design studios, negotiations, research, and development. They also said that the country must focus on signing free trade agreements or preferential trading agreements with nontraditional destinations to smooth export lines.

{"title": "New Age | Indian garment exporters reel under US tariffs", "body": "When Donald Trump was elected, Indian garment exporter RK Sivasubramaniam thought the new US president would boost business and invested heavily in anticipation of a boom. But less than a year later, everything is ‘upside down’, he admits with a pained smile. Trump’s 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods, imposed in August, have upset the country’s $11 billion textile export industry and shaken confidence in the US market. Sivasubramaniam’s Raft Garments factory in southern India, normally frenetic with humming sewing machines, is quieter and work hours have been cut, hitting employees’ paypackets. If his US buyers turn to other suppliers, half his business could vanish. Meanwhile, half a million garments sit in towering stacks, ready for shipment but stalled over who will pay the new duties. Buyers are asking for a 16-20 per cent discount. ‘We cannot give that much,’ said Sivasubramaniam, whose desk carries crossed US and Indian flags. ‘It’s a very huge loss for us.’ If Raft doesn’t shoulder part of the duties, it won’t be paid for garments already produced — leaving it unable to cover costs. ‘If it continues for another month... we cannot give work to our employees,’ he warned. Trump’s anger at India’s purchases of Russian oil — which Washington says help finance Moscow’s war in Ukraine — has left New Delhi facing some of the world’s steepest tariffs. A trade deal that could ease that hinges partly on progress in peace talks. But the fallout is being felt in Tiruppur, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Dubbed India’s ‘knitwear capital’, and ‘Dollar City’ for its export earnings, the small industrial town produced $5 billion in garments last fiscal year, two-fifths going to the United States. Its lanes are dotted with thousands of units including dyeing, embroidery and sewing workshops. Manufacturers paint a grim picture. ‘US orders have largely stopped, around 80 per cent of the US business has reduced,’ said Ramesh Jebaraj of Trinity Tex. In the same season last year, he produced 1,00,000 garments. Now he has barely a fifth of that — forcing him to seek buyers in Israel and the United Arab Emirates. ‘This is the situation across Tiruppur,’ he told AFP. ‘Some of the bigger factories are on the verge of closing some of their units.’ Alexander John of NC John Garments, which supplies Walt Disney, called the tariff standoff ‘the worst possible situation any business can be in’. With his US orders ‘completely at a standstill’, he has cut shifts and laid off workers. To stay afloat, he is looking to Europe and Britain but said ‘none of these markets can replace the US’. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has warned that up to three million jobs could be at risk across the state’s textile belt, a grim prospect for a country struggling to provide well-paid work for its youth. Local industry associations say they have so far avoided widespread layoffs by agreeing to steep discounts on US shipments. ‘In the short term, we’re giving discounts to the customer ranging from 20 to 25 per cent,’ said N. Thirukkumaran, general secretary of the Tiruppur Exporters Association. But he admits it is not a long-term solution, and has pleaded for government support. Exporters describe the move as a calculated gamble, by selling at a loss to maintain US buyer relationships while awaiting a trade deal. At RRK Cotton’s facility in Palladam, 17 kilometres (10 miles) from Tiruppur, dimly lit production halls are quieter than normal. Owner R Rajkumar, a former tailor who built his business over three decades, has closed two factories and furloughed some staff. ‘This is a situation nobody could have anticipated,’ he said, adding that he was running three factories fulfilling European orders, and shipping some US orders after giving a discount. He fears the next ordering cycle could be disrupted if US buyers shift to rivals such as Vietnam or Bangladesh. All that depends on a trade deal. Meanwhile, anger and confusion run deep among workers and business owners. ‘My tailor... He doesn’t know what is a trade war, or why India is buying oil from Russia, and why it is affecting our lives, our bread,’ said Kumar Duraiswamy, CEO of Eastern Global Clothing. ‘The problem is we are helpless,’ he added. N Karthick Raja, 38, employed at a small embroidery unit now running reduced shifts, fears for his livelihood. ‘If this job goes away, I don’t know what I will do next,’ he said. ’America has abandoned us, more or less.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/apparel/278475/indian-garment-exporters-reel-under-us-tariffs", "date": "2026-01-18T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 780}

Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), inaugurated the three-day event organized by Eco Expo. Nipa Jannat, director of BGBA and EBFCI, Abdul Hamid, senior vice-president of BGBA; Nizam Uddin Bipu, president of MBABD; Wali Tushar Uddin, president of EBFCI; and Masoodar Rahman, president of BGMEA attended the event as special guests. This year’s exhibition features leading textile and apparel manufacturers from China, India, and Pakistan, who are showcasing cutting-edge machinery, sustainable fabrics, smart apparel technologies, and innovative solutions. From the very first day, the expo premises have been bustling with visitors and innovative products. A tour around the venue revealed growing business connections and partnerships among local and international entrepreneurs. A representative of Pakistan’s Unicorn International commented Bangladesh shows promising success ‘But the shipping cost from Pakistan to Bangladesh is relatively high. If a direct trade route can be opened, investment and business opportunities will expand significantly.’ Li Ha, a representative from a Chinese company, said, ‘We’re receiving a strong response from day one. China’s investment in Bangladesh’s market has always been substantial, and this expo will further strengthen that relationship.’ Visitor Habibur Islam remarked, ‘I’ve seen China’s advanced textile machinery and fabrics here. It gives a clear picture of where Bangladesh stands in the global market—very impressive.’ Another visitor, Chaiti Ghosh, added, ‘The fair is beautifully organized. I’ve seen fabrics at the Indian, Pakistani, and Chinese stalls that are entirely new to Bangladeshi market. This exhibition will open a new horizon for our apparel industry.’ Bangladesh’s RMG sector continues to hold a key position in global economy. By the end of 2024, export earnings from the sector reached $50 billion.

{"title": "New Age | RMG exports to major markets mixed in July-Sept", "body": "The country’s readymade garment exports to major markets experienced either narrow or moderate growth, with some markets seeing a decline during the July-September period, the first quarter of the current financial year 2025-26. According to country-wise detailed export data from the Export Promotion Bureau, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $9.97 billion in the first three months of FY26, which 4.79 per cent higher than that of $9.51 billion in the same period of FY25. Exporters said that August, September and October were a lean season for them, as there were fewer orders and fewer UD inquiries, resulting in less growth, with even negative growth in a single month of August. Moreover, due to the reciprocal tariff imposed by the United States, orders from the destination declined, leading to increased competition in Europe. In the July-September period of FY26, Bangladesh exported RMG items worth $4.75 billion to the European Union countries, the largest market for Bangladeshi manufacturers, which was 3.64 per cent higher than that of $4.58 billion of the same period of FY25. The export earnings from the EU accounted for 47.60 per cent of the total earnings, according to the EPB data, compiled by the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange, a private initiative working to promote the apparel and textile industry in Bangladesh. However, export earnings from major EU countries like Germany and France declined in the first quarter of FY26, the EPB data stated. Export earnings from the United States witnessed a robust growth of 8.6 per cent to $2.01 billion, up from $1.85 billion in the July-September period of FY25, defying the tariff fears. The US, the largest single-country destination for Bangladeshi exporters, represented a 20.18 per cent share of the total earnings. Bangladesh bagged $1.22 billion from the UK in the three months of FY26, which was 6.74 per cent higher than the $1.14 billion earned in the same period of FY25. From Canada, the RMG sector earned $336.70 million in the reporting period of FY26, 13.63 per cent more than the $296.32 million earned in the corresponding period of FY25. In July-September, earnings from Germany witnessed a negative growth of 3.17 per cent to $1.12 billion, which was $1.16 billion in the first quarter of FY25, the EPB data showed. Export earnings from Spain stood at $1 billion, those from the Netherlands $548 million, France $472 million, Italy $336 million and Poland $380 million. However, export earnings from France witnessed a decline of over 2 per cent. Regarding apparel exports, countries like the US, Canada, the UK and the EU are considered traditional markets, while other countries are deemed non-traditional ones. Japan, Australia, Russia, India, China, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia, Brazil and Mexico are major non-traditional export destinations. Export earnings from the non-traditional market also demonstrated a narrow positive growth of 0.77 per cent to $1.65 billion in July-September of FY26, which was $1.64 billion in the same period of FY25. The non-traditional market represented 16.61 per cent of Bangladesh’s total RMG exports. Among these markets, Japan led with imports worth $335 million from Bangladesh, followed by India at $217 million, Australia $209 million and South Korea $111 million. However, exports to Australia experienced a decline of over 8 per cent. RMG exports to Turkey and Mexico also witnessed significant earnings, amounting to $66 million and $71 million respectively, in the July-September period of FY26. Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that RMG exports declined in many destinations as a number of factories got fewer orders than usual. Moreover, Bangladeshi exporters are encountering US tariffs, increasing competition in the EU and other markets and some domestic challenges, he said. ‘We fear that this slowdown may persist over the next two to three months. However, we expect exports to recover once international buyers adjust to the new tariff regime,’ Hatem added. Mohiuddin Rubel, former director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that Bangladesh’s current growth in exports significantly depended on the EU and the US. The growth on the non-traditional market underscores the importance of further research and focus in this category, as it possesses substantial growth potential, which will also help balance reliance on traditional markets, he added. Exporters also said that August, September, and October were lean periods for RMG items, and the exports might witness a rebound starting in November and December. In FY25, the RMG sector earned $39.35 billion from its global destinations.

{"title": "New Age | Govt asked to ensure due diligence at all factories", "body": "The country’s business leaders on Wednesday urged the government to ensure due diligence in all factories across the country. In the context of the Tuesday’s fire incident at Mirpur, the industry leaders also stressed the need for increased monitoring by the government and relevant authorities to ensure compliance with adequate fire safety rules. A fire broke out at a chemical warehouse in the capital’s Mirpur area on Tuesday, which spread to adjacent factories and claimed at least 16 people. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Labour and Employment formed a seven-member investigation committee to determine the cause of the fire, assess the extent of the damage, and identify any negligence in the inspection process. Inamul Haq Khan, acting president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, urged the DIFE and relevant authorities to ensure due diligence across all industries to uphold the highest standards of compliance, for the greater interest of both our industries and the nation’s reputation. In a written statement, he also said the government to take firm enforcement measures to ensure that no illegal facilities or warehouses operate outside regulatory oversight. Inamul expressed concern over misleading and sensationalised headlines circulating in recent media reports about the tragic fire incident. He said that the fire originated in a chemical warehouse, and toxic fumes and smoke from the explosion spread to nearby establishments, tragically claiming lives. ‘The affected facilities are not members of BGMEA, nor affiliated with any recognised industry association, nor covered under the RMG Sustainability Council,’ he added. He also said that these units were therefore not part of the formal, export-oriented readymade garment industry in Bangladesh. Ina separate statement, Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Taskeen Ahmed expressed shock and sorrow over the loss of lives by the raging fire. He urged the government to ensure proper medical treatment for the injured so that they can make a quick recovery. The chamber called upon all concerned to strictly follow fire safety standards and regulations while building construction to prevent such tragic incidents in the future, especially in industrial structures. Taskeen Ahmed also stressed the need for increased monitoring by the government and relevant authorities to ensure compliance with adequate fire safety rules. ‘The public and private sectors should take concerted efforts to raise awareness and implement effective measures to ensure adequate fire protection systems in industrial establishments and residential buildings, which will play a crucial role in safeguarding lives and property across the country,’ he added. Meanwhile, M Sakhawat Hussain, adviser to the Ministry of Labour and Employment, expressed shock and sorrow over the tragic fire at the factories in Mirpur. In a statement, he said that the ministry formed a seven-member investigation committee to determine the cause of the fire, assess the extent of the damage, and identify any negligence in the inspection process. The committee has also been directed to submit a comprehensive and objective report within seven working days, including recommendations on damage assessment, accountability, risk evaluation, and necessary measures to prevent similar incidents in the future. The ministry stated that the committee›s findings would guide future actions to enhance workplace safety and prevent such industrial tragedies from recurring. To support the victims, the adviser announced that each family of the deceased workers would receive Tk 200,000 in financial assistance from the Bangladesh Workers Welfare Foundation, while each injured worker would receive Tk 50,000 to cover medical expenses. On Wednesday, Fire Service and Civil Defense officials said that the lock of the main gate of the burnt chemical warehouse had been broken open, but toxic fumes continue to fill the site, making it too dangerous to enter. The operations were still ongoing and it might take a long time to fully extinguish the chemical fire. According to the officials, the chemical warehouse had not any licence from DIFE or Fire Service, like many others factories operating at the Rupnagar area of Mirpur, which are dangerously closed to restaurants, university, and residential buildings.

{"title": "New Age | Number of LEED-certified factories now 268", "body": "Five more Bangladeshi readymade garment factories have obtained United States Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, LEED, certification, bringing the total number of LEED-certified factories in the country to 268. According to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, of the 268 green factories, 114 are platinum-rated, 135 gold-rated, 15 silver-rated and four are certified. In October, Savar-based Pakiza Knit Composite Limited obtained a platinum certificate under the O+M: Existing Buildings v4.1 rating system, achieving a score of 87. Fashion Pulse Limited, a Dhaka-based factory, also achieved a platinum certificate under the LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system, achieving a score of 87. GSVA Private Limited, another Dhaka-based factory, also achieved a platinum certificate under the same system with a similar score to the above one. Chattogram-based Visual Knitwear Limited got a gold certificate under the O+M: Existing Buildings v4.1 rating system, achieving a score of 76. Another Chattogram-based factory, Talisman Performance Ltd, also achieved a gold certificate under the LEED BD+C: New Construction v4 rating system, achieving a score of 62. Among the world’s top 100 LEED factories, 68 units, including 18 of the top 20, are in Bangladesh. This success is expected to attract new investment and partnerships, reinforcing Bangladesh’s position as a sustainable manufacturing hub. According to industry insiders, a total of 550 factories were now awaiting the USGBC’s LEED certification. The factories of Bangladesh have been obtaining the LEED certificate since 2011. The USGBC honours factories based on several criteria: transformation performance, energy, water, and waste management. The best performers are rated platinum, followed by gold and silver. According to industry insiders, these criteria enable green factories to significantly reduce operational costs over time, even though they may initially incur higher setup costs. Mohiuddin Rubel, managing director of Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and former director of the BGMEA, said that as the world increasingly prioritised ESG performance and sustainability in supply chains, this milestone enhanced the country’s global image. He said that this achievement came at a time when the industry was navigating significant headwinds, including just settled US reciprocal tariff issues and domestic setbacks, both political, financial and energy-related. ‘However, in the face of such pressures, our entrepreneurs continue to invest in sustainable infrastructure and practices, demonstrating extraordinary resilience and long-term vision,’ he added. According to apparel manufacturers, the move towards green factory buildings helped regain Bangladesh’s image after the Rana Plaza tragedy, which claimed 1,134 lives and left more than 2,000 injured.

{"title": "New Age | Safety risks persist at unlicensed, unaffiliated RMG units", "body": "Fire safety concerns persists as hundreds of readymade garment factories across Bangladesh continue operating without government licences or trade body affiliation, exposing thousands of workers to life-threatening hazards. According to the data from government offices, several recent factory fires, including the deadly blaze in Mirpur’s Shialbari, occurred in unlicenced factories lacking fire exits, alarms, or extinguishing systems. These factories, unaffiliated with the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association or the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, operate with limited oversight and inadequate safety measures, raising serious concerns for workers. Data from the Department of Fire Service and Civil Defence show that 234 fire incidents occurred at RMG factories in 2024 alone. The Department of Inspection for Factories and Establishments reported receiving information on safety issues at 143 RMG factories during the 2023–24 fiscal year. Experts and industry insiders urged the authorities to ensure due diligence across all industries, saying it is their fundamental responsibility. They also called on the government to work jointly with trade bodies so that all factories come under the purview of at least one organisation. ‘In this regard, associations could introduce an associate or assistant membership so that small factories can be brought under monitoring,’ said Khondaker Golam Moazzem, executive director of the Centre for Policy Dialogue. He added that the government must ensure that no factory operates without membership. ‘The government’s main focus has been on export-oriented factories, but it should also prioritise non-member small units and create a strong database of them,’ he said. Industry stakeholders said that the absence of registration and trade body oversight allows factory owners to bypass safety upgrades, increasing the risk of casualties in the event of a fire or explosion. BGMEA acting president Inamul Haq Khan said the Shialbari factories involved in the recent fire were not BGMEA members nor affiliated with any recognised industry association, nor covered by the RMG Sustainability Council. He said that such incidents sometimes tarnish the image of the country’s compliant RMG sector. On Tuesday, a fire broke out at a chemical warehouse in Mirpur’s Shialbari area, spreading to adjacent factories and killing at least 16 people. The chemical warehouse, Shah Alam Chemical, had no licence from the Fire Service or DIFE, officials said. In the Shialbari area, dozens of factories are operating dangerously close to universities, hotels, and residential buildings. A senior DIFE official said, ‘Only a few factories in that area have DIFE certification. Though our teams conduct drives regularly, some units escape raids.’ Fire Service director (operation and maintenance) Lt Col Tajul Islam said the warehouse, listed as Shah Alam Traders, was already included in the Fire Service’s list of illegal establishments and was scheduled for a drive. Industry insiders said that not just in Mirpur, but several hundred apparel factories spread across the city are posing safety risks to workers. A 2023 CPD report found about 856 RMG factories are not monitored by any agency, such as the RMG Sustainability Council or the Remediation Coordination Cell. The Mapped in Bangladesh project, launched in 2017 to create a digital database of RMG workers and factories, identified 815 non-member factories that export 80 per cent or more of their products. Bangladesh Institute of Labour Studies executive director Syed Sultan Uddin Ahmed said repeated factory fires occur due to weak laws and a lack of accountability among enforcement agencies. ‘None of these are accidents; they are acts of negligent homicide. Unless the laws are reformed and justice ensured, such tragedies will not stop. There is no deterrent for owners who ignore safety rules,’ he said. Syed Sultan, also chairman of the Labour Reform Commission, said any building found with safety issues must be shut down immediately. ‘We fail to take such measures seriously because of our disregard for workers’ lives,’ he said. He added that many issues fall outside the Fire Service’s jurisdiction, and the law must be amended. ‘You cannot ensure safety with four months’ imprisonment and two months’ compensation,’ he said, urging for accountability of government authorities to a tripartite committee and regular joint drives by the Fire Service, DIFE, and the Environment Department. He also called for community empowerment and the formation of safety committees in every factory, noting that the largest chapter of the commission’s report was dedicated to workplace safety. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics’ Labour Force Survey 2024, the country’s total labour force stands at 69.10 million, with 58.04 million in informal employment. Among 11 million formal workers, nearly 4 million are employed in the RMG sector. A DIFE official said they try to conduct operations but cannot cover all factories due to manpower shortages. Bangladesh has witnessed several devastating factory fires over the years, including the Tazreen Fashions, Nimtali, Churihatta, Hashem Foods, and Tongi chemical warehouse fires, which claimed hundreds of lives. Industry insiders alleged that DIFE and the Fire Service often conduct drives only at compliant factories due to vested interests, while non-member small factories largely remain unchecked. Sammilito Garment Sramik Federation president Nazma Akter criticised the trade bodies for their reluctance to include non-member factories in the formal system. She observed that international brands also bore responsibility, since subcontracted factories were an essential part of the supply chain. Referring to the recent Mirpur fire, Nazma questioned the effectiveness of DIFE’s oversight and how factories continued to operate without compliance in residential areas.

{"title": "New Age | Apparel export to EU rises by 13pc", "body": "Bangladesh’s apparel exports to the European Union countries witnessed a 13.13 per cent year-on-year growth in the January–August 2025 period, reaching €13.48 billion, according to the Eurostat, released recently. The export earnings were €11.92 billion in the same period of 2024. Despite the robust performance in cumulative export earnings, Bangladesh’s monthly exports to the EU in August 2025 dropped by 8.04 per cent to €1.49 billion, compared with €1.62 billion in August 2024. Bangladesh remained the second-largest apparel exporter to the EU after China, consolidating its position with double-digit growth in 2025. The country’s 13.13 per cent rise outpaced the EU’s overall import growth of 9.29 per cent, reflecting Bangladesh’s competitiveness in terms of price, compliance, and sustainability credentials. The European Union’s total apparel imports reached €59.89 billion in the first eight months of 2025, marking a 9.29 per cent year-on-year increase from €54.81 billion in the same period of 2024. However, imports in August 2025 declined by 6.48 per cent to €7.95 billion, reflecting temporary demand weakness and retail adjustments across major EU economies. Among the major exporters, China, while maintaining its dominance, recorded 17.19 per cent growth during the first eight months of 2025, with export earnings rising to €16.91 billion. However, its exports dropped slightly by 5.21 per cent in August 2025 to €2,837.20 million, down from €2,993.13 million a year earlier. Turkey experienced one of the sharpest declines among major suppliers in the EU market. The country’s apparel exports to the EU fell to €676.41 million in August 2025, a drop of 21.6 per cent from €862.75 million in the same month of 2024. Over the eight-month period, exports totalled €5.72 billion, down 9.51 per cent from the previous year. India recorded mixed results, with exports of €324.62 million in August 2025, representing a 6.12 per cent decline from a year earlier. However, its cumulative exports to the EU rose by 11.88 per cent to €3.45 billion in the first eight months of 2025. Cambodia emerged as the strongest performer, registering the highest growth rate among major EU apparel suppliers. The country’s apparel exports to the EU rose by 5.79 per cent in August 2025 to €435.08 million, while cumulative exports for the January–August period surged by 25.9 per cent to €2.92 billion. Vietnam also showed solid performance in the EU market, with apparel exports rising by 6.53 per cent in August 2025 to €412.15 million and cumulative exports up by 15.81 per cent to €2.84 billion. The country’s growth is driven by its expanding synthetic apparel and sportswear industries and its preferential access under the EU–Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA). Pakistan recorded steady growth in the EU market during the January–August 2025 period, with apparel exports rising by 12.54 per cent to €2.53 billion, up from €2.25 billion a year earlier. However, monthly exports in August 2025 edged down slightly by 0.69 per cent to €320.29 million. Indonesia registered modest gains in the EU market, with exports up by 2.95 per cent in August 2025 to €87.45 million, and cumulative exports in the first eight months of 2025 rising by 8.01 per cent to €678.20 million.

{"title": "New Age | Bangladesh sees 61pc inspection growth", "body": "SHIFT IN USA RMG SOURCING Inspection and audit demand from US garment buyers in Bangladesh surged by 61 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025, making the country one of the strongest performers among Asian suppliers, as American companies continued to shift sourcing away from China, according to a latest report. The United States’ ongoing realignment of its global sourcing away from China is opening new opportunities for Bangladesh and other South and Southeast Asian manufacturing hubs, the Quality Inspection Management (QIMA), a leading provider of supply chain compliance solutions, said in its report. Nearly six months after the ‘Liberation Day’ policy shift, Q4 2025 QIMA Barometer showed a marked reduction in US procurement from China, offset by rising demand across alternative production centres in Asia. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association senior vice-president Inamul Haq Khan said that Vietnam, which produces higher-end garments, as well as Cambodia, are performing better. He said that work orders had slowed in the July–September quarter due to reduced US consumer purchases, but he hoped the flow might improve in the final quarter of 2025. Inamul also said that Bangladeshi exporters were facing increased competition in the EU market, as India and China were aggressively seeking to expand their business there following the US’s imposition of high tariffs on the two countries. Bangladesh maintained its position as the third-largest apparel exporter to the US in 2024, with exports rising slightly by 0.75 per cent to $7.34 billion, while US apparel imports from China increased marginally by 0.79 per cent to $16.51 billion. The barometer, titled ‘Despite US Tariff Posturing, World Favors Trade Over Wars,’ analysed tens of thousands of QIMA inspections and audits worldwide and outlined three major themes: the mounting challenges of ‘friend-shoring’ for US supply chains, China’s pivot to Latin America, and Europe’s steady overseas sourcing patterns. Inspection and audit volumes in China fell 24 per cent year-on-year in the third quarter of 2025, reflecting the combined impact of punitive tariffs and a deliberate disengagement by American companies seeking to de-risk their supply chains. By contrast, inspection activity rose 26 per cent in South Asia and 39 per cent in Southeast Asia, as global buyers continued to diversify their sourcing networks, QIMA Barometer showed released on October 14. Within the region, Sri Lanka recorded the highest growth, with inspection and audit demand soaring 75 per cent YoY, driven by renewed orders from apparel buyers diversifying away from both China and India. Cambodia also reported a strong 36 per cent increase, while Vietnam and Indonesia saw more moderate growth of 21 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively. Despite the positive trend, QIMA warned that the outlook for US sourcing in Asia remains uncertain. The newly introduced ‘transshipment tariffs,’ aimed at curbing indirect exports from China through third countries, could disrupt trade with key Southeast Asian hubs such as Vietnam. Additionally, rising trade tensions with India in late August have already begun to appear in sourcing data, raising concerns about whether the current pace of diversification can be sustained. The data indicated that European buyers had maintained a steadier approach to sourcing. It showed that inspection demand from the European buyers across Southeast Asia increased by 8 per cent year-on-year, led by Vietnam, which saw a 21 per cent rise, Thailand with an 18 per cent increase, and Cambodia, where inspections grew by 10 per cent. The data showed that closer to home, nearshoring partnerships around the Mediterranean had recorded solid gains in the third quarter of 2025, with inspection activity rising by 15 per cent year-on-year in Morocco, 19 per cent in Tunisia, and 24 per cent in Egypt. The report noted that Egypt’s performance reflected its growing role as a regional rival to Turkey, supported by significant foreign investment in its textile industry.

{"title": "New Age | RMG sector may face losses worth $1b", "body": "HSIA CARGO VILLAGE FIRE Leaders of the country’s readymade garment sector estimated that losses from the devastating fire at the cargo village complex of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka might exceed $1 billion. They explained that the sector might lose millions of dollars due to the burning of the imported products, and its impact might be devastating for delaying export and suspending orders. The exporters said that the incident dealt a serious blow to the country’s export trade, particularly the RMG sector, while speaking to the journalists during a visit to the cargo village near Gate No 8 of the HSIA on Sunday. Earlier on Saturday, a massive fire erupted at around 2:30pm at the airport’s import cargo village, and within moments, it spread rapidly, burning down two of the three sections of the cargo complex before reaching the chemical warehouse near Gate-8. The director general of Fire Service and Civil Defence at about 10:00pm on Saturday said that the fire had been brought under control but not fully extinguished, adding that it would take more time. Even by Sunday noon, the operation was still ongoing. Delegations of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Bangladesh Garment Accessories and Packaging Manufacturers and Exporters Association, and a number of clearing and forwarding agents visited the HSIA on Sunday. Inamul Haq Khan Bablu, acting president (senior vice president) of the BGMEA, said that they were here to visit the affected site and assess the situation firsthand. ‘Typically, high-value products and urgent shipments are transported by air. The fire has completely destroyed many such critical consignments,’ he added. Among the damaged goods were export-ready garments, valuable raw materials, and, most importantly, sample products prepared for upcoming business deals. ‘These samples are crucial in developing new business opportunities and the loss poses a serious threat to future export prospects and business growth,’ he added. They are currently working to assess the extent of the damage and collect detailed information, he added, saying that they have sent letters to member factories requesting a list of lost or damaged goods in a prescribed format. ‘Almost all our members use air shipment for exports. On average, 200–250 factories export products daily by air. Hence, the financial impact of this fire is substantial,’ he added. The BGMEA will soon hold a coordination meeting with all authorities concerned. He urged the government to provide comprehensive support and compensation for the affected entrepreneurs. He also urged the immediate facilitation of new shipments to maintain the smooth operation of exports. ‘As the dry season is ongoing, we must all remain vigilant to prevent such incidents in the future. We urge all factories and industrial establishments to take heightened fire safety precautions to avoid similar tragedies,’ he added. BGMEA director Faisal Samad described the scene inside as ‘horrific’. ‘The entire import section has been gutted and our initial estimate is that losses could exceed millions of dollars,’ he added. He also said that the government would provide immediate assistance to facilitate the import of new consignments by arranging temporary arrangements at Terminal 3 for import storage, and clearance procedures would now be completed within 36 hours instead of the previous 72. ‘A joint working committee with Customs is being formed to expedite the release of goods,’ he added, saying that they would continue work even on weekends. BKMEA president Mohammad Hatem said that the government should provide insurance facilities properly to cover the losses. However, a number of importers, especially smaller ones, don›t have any insurance facilities. ‘We urge the government to identify those importers and provide incentives from the governmental side,’ he added. The fire in the import section already burnt the imported products, and the businesses would face further blow as they couldn’t export the final products dependent on the burnt goods. He questioned the facilities of the airport, as such a devastating fire at one of the most important KPI facilities proved the country’s poor maintenance systems. The government should investigate properly whether there was any negligence and improperness, he added, saying that a number of incidents of the fire could be a planned or sabotage ones. Responding to a question, he said that the buyers from global destination already expressed their worry about the fire, which could tarnish the image of the country. Regarding the losses, he said that it was not less than $1 billion on spot losses and its impact on further exports. Md Shahriar, president of the BGAPMEA, said their sector had products worth around Tk 90-100 crore at the cargo village, which was burnt. ‘If we could not supply accessories timely, the RMG sector could suffer,’ he added. The BGMEA, BKMEA, BTMA, and BGAPMEA urged their members to assess the extent of the damage and submit detailed information to the respective association. On Sunday, the adviser to the Ministries of Civil Aviation and Tourism, and Commerce, SK Bashir Uddin, said that the full extent of the losses from the devastating fire at the imported goods cargo village is currently being assessed. He also said that all imported goods stored in the cargo depot had been destroyed. ‘We are now working to determine the total financial losses, the weight of the damaged goods, and conducting a sector-wise assessment,’ he added. He also said that their commitment was to resume airport operations by 9:00pm, and they succeeded,’ he said, adding that around 21 flights were diverted or canceled due to the fire. ‘To ease passenger inconvenience, all fees and charges for non-scheduled and additional flights have been waived for the next three days,’ he added. Responding to a question regarding a delayed fire response, he stated that he had spoken with Fire Service officials, who confirmed that the airport’s own firefighting unit began operations within 30 seconds of the fire breaking out. The WASA also provided water supply support, and any complaints of delay would be taken seriously and investigated. ‘A cataloguing committee has already been formed to analyse the pre-fire and post-fire conditions,’ he added. When asked about the possibility of sabotage, the adviser stated, they are considering all possibilities; nothing is being ruled out. He also dismissed any notion of weak firefighting capacity. Regarding the damaged goods, he explained, normally, all imports are covered by letters of credit. He also stated that if cargo operations were to cease, it would have a severe impact on global trade. ‘In coordination with NBR and BGMEA, we are arranging alternative measures and the work will continue 24/7 throughout the week to ensure an uninterrupted cargo supply,’ he added. He said that they would review whether the affected goods were covered by insurance and assess the adequacy of the airport’s own insurance coverage. Based on those findings, necessary actions would be taken. As of Sunday, white smoke continued to rise from the blazing cargo village, and firefighters were working to extinguish it completely. Meanwhile, hundreds of importers and clearing and forwarding agents demanded clarity regarding their losses and the causes behind the deadly blaze. Many gathered in front of the burnt-out complex, lamenting the massive losses from the blaze. Belal Hossain of Jane Trading Ltd, a C&F agent specialising in imports for the garments sector and various foreign investors, said that they had imported goods worth Tk 200 crore. Meanwhile, in a statement, the National Board of Revenue said that the Civil Aviation Authority has temporarily designated the GSE Maintenance area for storing goods. ‘Customs officials are conducting physical inspections of consignments at the site, have established ASYCUDA World connectivity at Gate No. 9, and are carrying out the clearance process through that gate,’ the statement added. In a statement, the Dhaka Customs Agents Association blamed the delayed response of the Civil Aviation Authority and the Fire Service for the severe damage to imported goods. The association also said that the fire completely destroyed the complex and the imported goods were stored there. The CAAB and FSCD failed to arrive at the spot instantly to douse the blaze, and this irreparable damage was caused due to the delay and a lack of coordination,’ said DCAA president Md Mizanur Rahman. The association said the imported goods storage complex is completely unusable, and it would not be possible to resume import operations without reconstruction. The association also called for the formation of an independent probe committee to determine the real cause of the fire, as it might be a plot to cripple economic activities by inflicting damage on factories and import-export operations.

{"title": "New Age | Record 36 factories earn LEED certification in 2025", "body": "The Bangladesh apparel industry has achieved a new global milestone in sustainable manufacturing with 36 factories earning international environmental compliance certifications in a single year. The record-breaking achievement in 2025 surpasses the previous high of 30 certifications awarded in 2022, solidifying Bangladesh’s position as a global leader in green garment production. According to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the latest tally is highlighted by 22 factories receiving the highest-level ‘LEED Platinum’ certification, further strengthening Bangladesh’s commitment to eco-friendly and sustainable operations. These prestigious certifications are awarded by the US Green Building Council (USGBC) under its globally recognised Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) system. To obtain the certification, facilities must meet rigorous environmental standards that evolve over time and across different versions of the rating system. LEED certification levels are determined by a score out of a total of 110 points: LEED Platinum:80+ points, Gold:60–79 points, Silver: 50–59 points, Certified:40–49 points. With this recent surge, Bangladesh now boasts a total of 268 LEED-certified garment factories. The vast majority are concentrated in the top tiers, reflecting a commitment to superior environmental standards: Among these, 114 factories Platinum factories, 135 gold factories, 15 silver factories and 4 certified factories in Bangladesh. Significantly, 68 of the world’s top 100 highest-rated LEED-certified factories are located in Bangladesh, underscoring the sector’s global benchmark status in sustainable manufacturing. Mohiuddin Rubel, Managing Director of the Bangladesh Apparel Exchange and Additional Managing Director of Denim Expert Limited, said that this achievement is a clear reflection of the Bangladesh apparel industry’s unwavering commitment to sustainable development and eco-friendly production. ‘We are now setting a positive example for the world,’ he added.

{"title": "New Age | 13pc of RMG workers await full benefit", "body": "LATEST MINIMUM WAGE REVISION Around 13 per cent of surveyed garment workers in Bangladesh have yet to receive the full wage increase under the country’s most recently revised minimum wage structure, with some receiving only partial hikes and others none at all, according to a recent study. The government set the minimum monthly wage for entry-level garment workers at Tk 12,500 in 2023, effective from January 2024. According to Rajshahi University Institute of Bangladesh Studies Professor Jakir Hossain, approximately 87 per cent of the surveyed workers have received the full wage increase that was reviewed two years ago. ‘Among the remaining 13 per cent, about 8 per cent received a partial increase, while 5 per cent did not get wages aligned with the revised grade,’ he said. He was speaking at a dissemination event on Sunday at a city hotel, where he presented findings from a study titled ‘Minimum Wage Implementation in Bangladesh’s Readymade Garment Sector: Status of Compliance and Consequences for Workers’. The survey was conducted between May and June 2025 and included 240 workers from 60 factories across Dhaka, Gazipur, Narayanganj and Chattogram, covering knit, woven and composite units. The event was organised by Awaj Foundation with support from Mondiaal FNV and moderated by Awaj Foundation executive director Nazma Akter. Former labour secretary AHM Shafiquzzaman, labour ministry joint secretary Md Abdus Samad Al Azad, and country programme director of Solidarity Centre Bangladesh AKM Nasim were among the speakers. Jakir Hossain said that the implementation of enhanced wages was higher in factories with trade unions and those known to comply with labour regulations. The study also highlighted other challenges faced by workers under the new wage structure. It found that 31 per cent surveyed workers reported delays in receiving overtime pay for periods ranging from one to ten months. Increased workload and production pressure were cited by 52 per cent as their primary difficulties, followed by job insecurity (22 per cent), irregular wage payments (14 per cent) and confusion over proper grade placement and promotion (11 per cent). The report also showed that 14 per cent of workers were unaware of the 9 per cent annual increment due from January 2025, while around two-thirds confirmed its implementation and 13 per cent had not received it. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Mahmud Hasan Khan refrained from commenting on the 13 per cent non-compliance, saying that the study did not specify whether the factories concerned were BGMEA or BKMEA members. He said that workers in export-oriented factories typically receive Tk 22,000 to Tk 25,000 at the end of each month. The BGMEA also called for annual wage revisions to avoid steep hikes of 60 to 90 per cent every five years, which often trigger labour protests. President of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Mohammad Hatem said that all member factories implemented the latest wage hike, though partial increases might have occurred in some cases. He said that monitoring non-member factories, including compliance with minimum wages and safety standards, is the government’s responsibility. Bangladesh programme manager for the International Labour Organisation Neeran Ramjuthan described non-compliance with minimum wages as a matter of deep concern, highlighting that timely and full wage payments are fundamental rights essential for workers’ livelihoods and social stability. She warned that failure to pay wages fully poses reputational risks for both the sector and the country. Ramjuthan stressed the need for strengthening inspections and oversight, publicly report inspection results, establish regular wage revision cycles, and ensure responsible purchasing practices by buyers to prevent undercutting minimum wages. IndustriALL Bangladesh Council general secretary Babul Akhter criticised factory owners for setting wage grades arbitrarily in the absence of clear instructions in the wage hike gazette, thereby denying workers their legal entitlement.

{"title": "New Age | BGMEA calls for reconsideration of the new labour ordinance", "body": "Leaders of the country’s readymade garment sector have expressed deep concern over certain provisions in the newly approved Bangladesh Labour (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025, particularly those related to trade union formation, calling them ‘imbalanced and impractical.’ They were speaking at a press conference on contemporary issues organised by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association on Tuesday at its office in the capital’s Uttara. Industry representatives said their earlier recommendations placed before the Tripartite Consultative Committee had not been reflected in the final draft. BGMEA president Mahmud Hasan Khan Babu said that during TCC discussions, the sector proposed a balanced structure — allowing trade unions to be formed with the consent of at least 50 workers in factories employing between 50 and 500 workers. ‘However, this consensus was later overturned at the advisory council’s meeting, which unilaterally revised the threshold from 20 to 300 workers and categorised factories into five groups,’ he said. Earlier, on October 23, the council of advisers approved the draft of the labour ordinance at a meeting chaired by interim government chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus. Responding to a question, Mahmud Hasan Khan said the new provision allowing unions with only 20 workers was unrealistic. In many industrial areas, there are workers’ messes where more than 100 workers of the same factory live. In such cases, even a house owner could provoke them to form a union, along with jhut traders and other outsiders, he said. Asked whether the BGMEA had discussed the issue with the interim government earlier, he said they had repeatedly sought an appointment over the past four months but had been unsuccessful. ‘Despite being the primary export earners, contributing $42 billion, the chief adviser did not give us an appointment.’ Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the labour adviser himself had initially proposed the balanced number. ‘He had agreed that a trade union could be formed with the consent of at least 50 workers in factories employing between 50 and 500 workers. We don›t understand why this threshold was later changed without any stakeholder consultation,’ he said. Citing regional examples, the BGMEA president said that in India, a union can be formed with the consent of at least 10 per cent of workers or 100 workers, whichever is less, while in Pakistan, the requirement is 20 per cent. During the tripartite meeting, 145 issues were discussed, of which the RMG leaders agreed on 142 points and noted dissent on three: the union threshold, the definition of workers, and the provident fund structure. He further said that the ordinance’s inclusion of ‘employees/officers’ within the definition of ‘workers’ would blur the boundary between administrative and labour levels in factories. On the pension scheme, Mahmud Hasan Khan said that the TCC had earlier agreed that factories could choose either the provident fund or the Pragati universal pension scheme, whichever suited their operational framework. However, the advisory council’s approval deviated from that understanding, allowing workers to participate in both schemes simultaneously. ‘This would compel entrepreneurs to manage two parallel financial systems, creating administrative complications, higher costs, and disorder in fund management,’ he said. He pointed out that India has only the Employees’ Provident Fund, Pakistan operates a single Social Security Scheme, Vietnam follows a unified National Pension and Insurance System, and Sri Lanka has only the EPF. Responding to a question about the increased charges at the Chattogram port, the BGMEA president said the sector was not opposed to higher fees if efficiency improved. ‘If port efficiency reaches an optimum level, we have no objection to increased charges. But our port remains one of the most inefficient in Asia, with no visible sign of improvement,’ he said. BKMEA president Mohammad Hatem added that while there were no geopolitical issues with appointing foreign operators, the business community opposed arbitrary fee hikes. ‘It is misleading to claim that port charges have not increased in 40 years. Due to currency depreciation, users are already paying 30–40 per cent more,’ he said. ‘The port has been making profits since its inception. As a state-run service institution, why is it chasing profit?’ he asked, adding that all stakeholders had opposed the fee hike. The BGMEA president also urged the government to postpone Bangladesh’s graduation from least developed country status. ‘The country is not yet prepared for LDC graduation. We haven’t signed any PTA, FTA, or EPA,’ he said. He called for extending Bangladesh’s graduation timeline by at least three years to safeguard competitiveness and ensure a smooth transition. ‘If we can present our case logically at the United Nations, we can convince the global community,’ he said. Leaders from the packaging and accessories, leather, pharmaceuticals, and other sectors, along with representatives from various chambers, were also present at the briefing.

{"title": "New Age | Experts emphasise value-added RMG production", "body": "Experts and industry insiders laid emphasis on production of value-added readymade garment items for long-term competitiveness and responsible supply chain management. To achieve this, they called for bridging the gap between business, creativity, academia and sustainability, providing actionable insights for a responsible and resilient fashion ecosystem. They were speaking at the opening episode of a virtual talk show series Inside Fashion on Thursday evening, titled ‘Value Over Volume – A New Vision for Bangladesh RMG’ organised by Fashion Business Journal in association with the BGMEA University of Fashion, Technology and Green Stitch and Textile and Garments Merchandising Blog. In his speech, Ayub Nabi Khan, vice chancellor (acting) of BUFT, said that Bangladesh’s RMG sector primarily focused on basic items. ‘It is essential to diversify into high-value products like medical textiles, military textiles, aeronautical textiles, and other technical textiles,’ he added. He said that to address this, they were gradually revising their curriculum to include these, along with short courses on 3D fashion design and AI-based courses, to avoid bureaucratic delays of including a new full course. Robert Antoshak, vice-president of Grey Matter Concepts, said that shifting from volume to value was not just a strategy; it was essential for long-term competitiveness and responsible supply chain management. Bangladesh should strengthen its domestic supply chain by producing more of its own yarns, fabrics and synthetic fibres, he said. Sadat Sayem, lead of Digital Fashion Innovation Research Project of Manchester Fashion Institute, said that digital innovation and technology could empower local producers to optimise efficiency and create a more sustainable industry globally. He emphasised the importance of adopting digital technologies in Bangladesh’s fashion industry, including 3D design, digital prototyping and AI-based systems. Sheikh HM Mustafiz, director of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said that sustainability could align with profitability in the apparel industry through investing in solar energy, water recycling, and waste reduction. He emphasised shifting the focus from solely on production costs to understanding the value of production, including product quality, reliability, compliance and brand reputation. Sharif As-Saber, editor-in-chief of Fashion Business Journal and international adviser of BGMEA, moderated the discussion.

They also said that with Bangladesh’s growing capacity for high-value production, Japanese buyers now have increased confidence in the country as a sourcing destination. A delegation from the Japan Textile Importers Association expressed their interest during a meeting with the leaders of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association on Monday evening. According to a press release issued by the BGMEA, the discussions centred on ways to enhance bilateral trade, particularly through expanding garment exports from Bangladesh to Japan. BGMEA president Mahmud Hasan Khan said Bangladesh’s garment industry is now strategically focused on market diversification, identifying Japan as a highly important and promising market. ‘The apparel sector is moving beyond basic cotton-based items to synthetic and technical textiles, aiming to shift the product mix towards the high-value segment,’ he said, urging Japanese buyers to increase their sourcing from Bangladesh. The Japanese delegation praised Bangladesh’s achievements in ensuring social and environmental compliance, as well as efforts to improve worker safety and welfare. The meeting also addressed issues related to supply chain efficiency. The JTIA representatives said that Japanese buyers attach utmost importance to short lead times and suggested simplifying Bangladesh’s customs procedures and enhancing the operational efficiency of the Chattogram port to facilitate smoother trade. The BGMEA leaders urged the delegation’s cooperation in easing the visa process for Bangladeshi businesspeople travelling to Japan. In response, the JTIA representatives assured that they would raise the issue with relevant Japanese authorities. The BGMEA also sought data and research on international market trends from the JTIA to support strategic planning for export diversification. The two sides also discussed the potential impact of Bangladesh’s LDC graduation in 2026, including tariff implications in key export markets. The BGMEA president urged Japan, through the JTIA, to consider extending duty-free market access for Bangladesh even after graduation, possibly under a mutually beneficial framework such as an Economic Partnership Agreement or Preferential Trade Agreement. The JTIA delegation included representatives from top Japanese apparel brands where BGMEA vice presidents and directors were also present at the meeting.

It is a crucial institution, and the public has the right to know about its performance. Our reporting is always respectful, never intended to insult,” he said. “I urge you to be a strong support for independent journalism.” Anam made the remarks at Media Convention 2026, jointly organized by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) at the Krishibid Institution Bangladesh (KIB) in Dhaka. Highlighting the complementary roles of independent journalism and a free judiciary, he said, “Contempt of court is a powerful tool, but it must not be misused. Sometimes, we regret judgments or statements that go against independent reporting.” He underscored journalists’ social responsibility, saying, “We enter this profession not just for a job, but to serve society. Our mission is to uphold democracy, human rights, equality, and protect the rights of people from all communities. This is the core principle of our profession.” Anam also noted that the constitution protects only two professions: the judiciary and independent media. “A society with strong independent journalism is democratic, equitable, and respects citizens’ rights. Journalists must always be aware of this,” he said. Urging journalists to uphold honesty, integrity, and ethical standards, he added, “Editors’ moral lapses affect the institution and tarnish the profession. Media owners must invest in journalism as a social mission, not just a business. If journalism serves commercial interests alone, the public will reject it.” Addressing the government, he said, “Independent journalism is the only institution that will tell you the truth.

{"title": "Millions of battery vehicles fuel power theft, lead pollution", "body": "Experts warn that without regulation, these vehicles are consuming massive amounts of electricity while releasing toxic waste into the environment Despite government pledges to promote energy efficiency and environmental protection, the rapid spread of battery-powered rickshaws and e-bikes has emerged as a growing strain on Bangladesh’s power system and a serious environmental and public health concern. Across districts from Bogra, Khulna and Rajshahi to Barisal, Sylhet, Rangpur, Tangail, Lakshmipur, Satkhira and Pabna - thousands of battery-powered vehicles now operate daily, supported by a vast network of mostly unauthorized charging points. Experts warn that without regulation, these vehicles are consuming massive amounts of electricity while releasing toxic waste into the environment. A study by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (Buet) estimates that more than one million battery-powered vehicles currently operate nationwide, consuming around 1,000 megawatts of electricity daily for charging alone. Private sector estimates suggest the number of e-bikes exceeds 1.1 million, alongside battery rickshaws and other three-wheeled electric vehicles. Government figures paint an even larger picture. In February 2025, the adviser for power, energy and mineral resources told that Bangladesh has around four million battery-powered rickshaws and e-bikes, with more than 1.2 million operating in Dhaka alone - about 10 lakh rickshaws and two lakh e-bikes. Yet none of these vehicles are registered with the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA), leaving the sector almost entirely unregulated. Most of these vehicles rely on lead-acid batteries, which pose severe environmental and health risks. Expired and damaged batteries are frequently dumped in open spaces or dismantled in informal workshops, releasing toxic metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury and nickel into soil, water and air. Research shows that lead contamination persists in nature, enters the food chain and disproportionately affects children. Informal “battery-breaking” workshops - often employing poor adults and children - extract lead using water, contaminating rivers, wetlands and farmland. Fish, crops and livestock absorb the toxins, which ultimately reach humans. A recent ICDDR,B survey found that children in Dhaka have blood lead levels nearly ten times higher than normal. Dr Mahbubur Rahman of ICDDR,B warned of the scale of the crisis: “One rickshaw releases around 20 kilograms of lead each year. Across four million vehicles, that means roughly 800 million kilograms of lead entering the environment annually. Imagine the impact over the next decade.” Buet Assistant Professor Kazi Md Shifun Newaz described the situation starkly, calling battery rickshaws in Dhaka “a cancer risk in an advanced stage” and urging immediate intervention. The electricity burden is equally alarming. Each e-bike requires four to five batteries and consumes five to six units of electricity per charge. Daily charging of one million vehicles places enormous pressure on the national grid. Dhaka alone has an estimated 5,000 charging stations, many using illegal electricity connections. According to Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), the city contains 3,300 legal charging stations, more than 48,000 illegal charging points, and 992 garages - each storing 80 to 150 vehicles. The Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC) says authorized charging stations consume over 26 megawatts of electricity daily, while illegal connections deprive the state of significant revenue. Despite official bans, battery-powered rickshaws continue to operate on major roads, including VIP routes. Attempts at enforcement often meet resistance, with drivers sometimes clashing with police. Meanwhile, factories in areas such as Kamrangir Char, Keraniganj, Komlapur, Sabujbagh, Manda, Gazipur and Tongi produce 400 to 500 battery rickshaws daily, priced between Tk60,000 and Tk80,000. Policy experts argue that outright bans are neither realistic nor fair, given that millions depend on battery-powered vehicles for livelihoods and affordable transport. The Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) and other experts recommend a comprehensive regulatory framework that includes transitioning from lead-acid to lithium-ion or solar-based batteries, shutting down illegal charging stations, providing financial and technical support to drivers, and establishing proper recycling systems for damaged batteries. Mozammel Haque, secretary of the Bangladesh Passenger Welfare Association, stressed the urgency: “With more than six million battery-powered vehicles nationwide, including around eight lakh in Dhaka, regulation is no longer optional. Without clear rules, the risks to public health, road safety and the power grid will only worsen.” Experts agree that without swift, coordinated action, Bangladesh risks trading short-term transport convenience for long-term environmental damage, health crises and energy insecurity.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401230/millions-of-battery-vehicles-fuel-power-theft", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 705}
{"title": "Editors urge unity to defend press freedom amid rising attacks", "body": "Senior editors, journalists and media leaders yesterday called for unity across the profession to defend press freedom and democratic values, warning that a growing pattern of attacks on media organizations threatens not only journalism but the future of democracy in Bangladesh. The call came at the country’s first-ever Media Convention, jointly organized by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB), held at the KIB auditorium in Dhaka. Journalists from Dhaka and across the country gathered to discuss rising attacks on news organizations, the safety of media workers and the erosion of professional standards. In his welcome address, Editors’ Council President Nurul Kabir said freedom of expression and democratic norms have come under sustained pressure in recent years, making unity among journalists “absolutely essential.” Referring to the recent attack on The Daily Star office, he said it was not an assault on a building but “a medieval form of brutality,” intended to terrorize journalists by trapping them inside and setting fire around them. “Today it happened to one media house; tomorrow it could happen to another,” Kabir warned, adding that safeguarding pluralism and diversity of opinion requires collective vigilance and solidarity. The Daily Star Editor and Publisher Mahfuz Anam paid tribute to the martyrs of the 1971 Liberation War and those killed during the July uprising, describing journalism as a public service rooted in democracy, human rights and equality. He said that the Constitution explicitly protects two institutions, an independent judiciary and an independent media, because of their central role in upholding democracy. Anam urged journalists to uphold ethical standards in both professional and personal lives, warning that moral failure erodes public trust in the entire profession. Addressing media owners, he cautioned against treating journalism solely as a commercial venture and called for a clear code of conduct to protect editorial independence. He also urged the judiciary not to misuse contempt of court provisions against journalists, stressing that independent journalism and an independent judiciary are complementary democratic forces. “No intelligence agency, bureaucracy or political loyalist will tell governments uncomfortable truths. Only free media can,” Anam said, urging authorities to view journalism as a partner in good governance rather than an adversary. Editors’ Council member and National Press Club President Hasan Hafiz said the convention was taking place at a critical moment ahead of elections, noting that attacks on media have a long history but remain a persistent threat. He urged political parties to include explicit commitments to press freedom and journalist safety in their election manifestos and proposed issuing a convention communique to press for reforms. Prothom Alo Editor Matiur Rahman stressed that unity among journalists is vital at all times, warning that internal divisions, often driven by political affiliations, ultimately weaken both press freedom and personal safety. “Any dispute - on any issue, at any time - is harmful,” he said, calling the coming together of print, broadcast, online media and journalists’ unions on a single platform a major milestone after decades of fragmentation. He cautioned against assuming that a political transition alone would guarantee press freedom, citing past experiences of repression under different regimes. “There is no reason to think that once an elected government comes, we will get everything,” he said. Journalists’ union leaders echoed similar concerns. Kader Gani Chowdhury, secretary general of the Bangladesh Federal Union of Journalists (BFUJ), described the media as “the eyes of democracy” and said division makes journalists vulnerable. Md Shahidul Islam, president of the Dhaka Journalists Union (DUJ), said unity raises the cost of intimidation and violence against the press. Broadcast Journalists Center President Rezwanul Haque said it was naive to assume any government welcomes independent journalism and criticized delays in implementing a media reform commission report. He urged the creation of a permanent common platform to respond swiftly to attacks and supported drafting a unified code of ethics. Editors from outside Dhaka highlighted routine intimidation and legal harassment in districts. M A Malek, editor of The Daily Azadi, warned that obstructing genuine journalism creates an information vacuum that fuels misinformation and instability. Veteran journalist and Editor Shafik Rehman called for resisting personality cults and proposed a newspaper standards committee to harmonize professional benchmarks. Reaz Ahmad, editor of the Dhaka Tribune, urged stronger self-regulation to “clean our own house,” while Faruk Wasif, director general of the Press Institute Bangladesh (PIB), said the profession faces both internal decay and external attacks. The convention concluded with broad consensus that defending press freedom is not only a professional struggle but a national responsibility. Speakers agreed that sustained unity, ethical journalism, credible self-regulation and collective action are essential to restoring public trust and protecting democratic space. The program was moderated by Dewan Hanif Mahmud, general secretary of the Editors’ Council and editor of Bonik Barta. Journalists and media professionals from across Bangladesh participated, marking the country’s first and largest gathering of media stakeholders under a single platform. Organizers said the convention could pave the way for similar initiatives in the future, signaling a renewed effort to confront threats to press freedom through unity and reform.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401231/editors-urge-unity-to-defend-press-freedom-amid", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 843}

According to the air quality and pollution city ranking, Dhaka registered an Air Quality Index (AQI) score of 275 at 10:10am, placing it third on the list of cities with the most polluted air. The city’s air was classified as \"unhealthy\". India’s capital Delhi topped the list with an AQI score of 605, while Pakistan’s Lahore secured the second position with an AQI of 297, both indicating extremely poor air conditions. When the AQI value for particle pollution is between 50 and 100, air quality is considered \"moderate\", usually sensitive individuals should consider limiting prolonged outdoor exertion, between 101 and 150, air quality is considered \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\", between 150 and 200 is \"unhealthy\", between 201 and 300 is said to be \"very unhealthy\", while a reading of 301+ is considered \"hazardous\", posing serious health risks to residents. The AQI, an index for reporting daily air quality, informs people how clean or polluted the air of a certain city is and what associated health effects might be a concern for them. The AQI in Bangladesh is based on five pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), NO2, CO, SO2 and ozone. Dhaka has long been grappling with air pollution issues. Its air quality usually turns unhealthy in winter and improves during the monsoon. As per World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution kills an estimated seven million people worldwide every year, mainly due to increased mortality from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer and acute respiratory infections.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401250/dhaka%E2%80%99s-air-quality-ranks-third-worst-globally", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 281}

The interns of the OMCH went on strike on Saturday morning protesting the attack on a female intern allegedly by the relatives of a patient. Many patients in the outpatient department reported waiting for long hours without being able to see a doctor. Although treatment is being provided at the emergency department, patients complained of delays compared to normal times. Several attendants said they had come from distant areas and were forced to wait for hours. Many returned home disappointed without receiving necessary tests or primary treatment. Intern doctors said they went on a strike to press home several demands. The authorities of the hospital said discussions are ongoing with the higher authorities to bring the situation back to normal. Mizanur Rahman, an intern of the hospital, said their strike is still ongoing. “The hospital administration has not yet assured us of increased security or clarified what level of force will be deployed to ensure our safety while providing treatment,” he said. Another meeting is scheduled to be held with the administration on Sunday, he added. Meanwhile, a general diary (GD) was lodged with Kotwali Police Station over the attack on the female intern, said Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Sylhet Kotwali Police Station Moinul Zakir.

{"title": "Tajul cautions against use of ‘mob’ term, politicians call it a ‘threat’", "body": "He said the movement to topple Ganabhaban could not be equated with acts such as street robberies or attacks on religious minorities by individuals from particular groups Chief Prosecutor of the International Crimes Tribunal Tajul Islam on Sunday cautioned against the use of the word “mob,” saying there is a mindset behind using the term to question the revolution and urging restraint in its use. He made the remarks at a policy dialogue titled “Independence of the Judiciary and the Rule of Law” at the CIRDAP auditorium in the capital. The event was organised by the Centre for Governance Studies (CGS). Tajul Islam’s comments drew sharp criticism from several speakers at the dialogue. Former Communist Party of Bangladesh (CPB) general secretary Ruhin Hossain Prince and Bangladesh Socialist Party (BSD) general secretary Bazlur Rashid Firoz described the remarks as a “threat.” Politicians, lawyers, human rights activists and civil society representatives took part in the discussion, where concerns over the role of mobs were raised alongside issues of judicial independence. In his opening remarks, CGS Executive Director Parvez Karim Abbasi said the country was witnessing “mobocracy” rather than the rule of law, pointing to what he described as trials on social media. He warned that symbolic measures would not ensure the rule of law if groups took the law into their own hands and punishment of offenders was delayed. Speaking on the rule of law, Jatiya Party Secretary General Shamim Haider Patwary said injustice, whether before or after a revolution, would ultimately backfire. He warned that mobs, once tolerated, could undermine institutions such as the government and the Election Commission, and even threaten the country itself. Responding to the remarks, Tajul Islam said the movement to topple Ganabhaban could not be equated with acts such as street robberies or attacks on religious minorities by individuals from particular groups. He stressed the need for caution in using the term “mob” and said repeated use of the word to question the achievements of the movement against Ganabhaban should be avoided. Former CPB general secretary Ruhin Hossain Prince countered that advocating the rule of law while encouraging mobs was contradictory and untenable in Bangladesh. BNP leader Nilufar Chowdhury also criticised Tajul Islam’s comments. The dialogue was moderated by CGS President Zillur Rahman, who noted that a senior government figure had previously dismissed the existence of mobs by describing them as “pressure groups.” He expressed concern that renewed justification of mob actions could lead to further incidents in the near future.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401262/tajul-cautions-against-use-of-%E2%80%98mob%E2%80%99-term", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 415}
{"title": "Study warns battery rickshaws dominate Dhaka’s streets amid weak oversight", "body": "It highlights how weak regulation is driving road safety risks, traffic disorder, and environmental hazards Battery-powered rickshaws have quietly but decisively reshaped Dhaka’s transport landscape. What began as an informal response to congestion and labour fatigue has become a dominant mode of short-distance travel, deeply embedded in the city’s economy and daily mobility. However, the largely unregulated growth of these vehicles is creating mounting risks—from road accidents and traffic disorder to toxic battery waste and long-term public health threats—according to a new study by Innovision Consulting. The findings were presented at a multi-stakeholder dissemination event in Dhaka on January 18, attended by transport planners, law enforcement officials, academics, civil society representatives, manufacturers, garage owners, and rickshaw pullers. Titled \"Urban Mobility Study: Rickshaws in Transition\", the research shows a transport system evolving faster than policy responses. Dhaka’s already strained mobility network is undergoing a structural shift as battery rickshaws steadily replace pedal rickshaws—not through government planning, but through market forces such as labour economics, passenger demand, and garage-level incentives. Researchers describe this as a parallel transport system operating largely outside formal regulation. The study surveyed 348 drivers, 312 passengers, and 63 garage owners across Dhaka North and South city corporations, using a methodology with a 95% confidence level. Innovision Consulting Managing Director Md Rubaiyat Sarwar said battery rickshaws are no longer temporary. “They are now an urban reality,” he said, urging policymakers to move from denial and crackdowns to phased regulation. Drivers aged 26–35 account for 34% of battery rickshaw operators, compared to 18% among pedal pullers. Nearly 60% of battery rickshaw drivers have less than two years of experience, compared to an average of 15 years among pedal rickshaw drivers, a gap that raises serious road safety concerns. About 75% of battery rickshaw drivers are new entrants, drawn by low entry barriers and immediate income opportunities amid rural employment shortages. Income remains the strongest incentive: 57.8% of battery rickshaw drivers reported higher earnings after switching, compared to 31.8% of pedal pullers. Nearly 40% of battery rickshaw drivers complete 31–50 trips per day, compared to 12.6% of pedal rickshaw drivers. Ownership is limited: only 21% of battery rickshaw drivers own their vehicles, while nearly 80% rely on rentals. Self-owned vehicles generate an average daily income of Tk970, while rented ones yield Tk418 due to high rental costs averaging Tk414 per day. Among owners, 51% rely on microfinance or NGO loans, raising concerns about debt stress. Battery rickshaws are primarily used for short trips, with 17.3% of journeys for commuting to work and 13.8% connecting passengers to public transport. Speed is the decisive factor for 74% of passengers, while 93% prioritized speed over safety when forced to choose—even though 82% acknowledged safety risks. Usage is highest among passengers earning Tk20,000–30,000 per month, with nearly 79% aged 18–44. Passenger data show higher accident frequency and severity for battery rickshaws, with over 21% describing accidents as “very serious,” compared to 8.5% for pedal rickshaws. Drivers reported fewer accidents, partly due to fear of regulatory crackdowns. While 62% of respondents blamed battery rickshaws for congestion, experts cautioned that illegal parking, road encroachment, and weak traffic management often play a larger role. Fahim Mashroor of Voice for Reform said battery rickshaws are filling a jobs vacuum caused by inadequate rural employment, but warned formalisation must avoid “syndicate-driven” licensing systems seen in other transport sectors. DTCA Traffic Enforcement Officer Md Selim Khan highlighted the operational vacuum, citing the absence of designated parking and route discipline. He added that while domestic air travel averages Tk15 per kilometre, short rickshaw trips in Dhaka cost Tk20–30 per kilometre. Buet's Prof Mosleh Uddin Hasan said pedal rickshaw pulling causes extreme physical strain and long-term health damage, noting that safer, regulated technology could reduce this burden if standards are enforced. Garage owner Abdur Rahman said many garages have converted to battery rickshaws to survive competition, but rising numbers and costs have squeezed margins, making legal charging access and policy clarity critical. Rickshaw puller Mohammad Jahangir said battery rickshaws reduce physical suffering, but increased competition has intensified fare pressure, limiting income gains. Environmental risks were also highlighted. EU program official Taif Hossain warned that unsafe battery recycling could spread lead contamination through air, soil, and the food chain. Lead-acid batteries last 800–1,000 cycles, while lithium batteries offer 3,000–5,500 cycles but remain costlier. Keystex co-founder Tawsif Anwar proposed separating battery ownership from drivers through a centralized swapping system to ensure controlled disposal and recycling. Akij Motors General Manager Iftekhar Hossain said high import duties—often above 90%—discourage investment in safer, standardised vehicles, keeping low-quality options dominant. Speakers agreed that banning battery rickshaws is unrealistic, but regulation is unavoidable. The study recommends phased, data-driven regulation, including safety standards, controlled entry, affordable credit linked to registration, mandatory training, route restrictions, and clear institutional responsibilities. The study concludes that battery rickshaws are now integral to Dhaka’s transport future. Without swift, evidence-based governance, the city risks trading short-term convenience for long-term costs in road safety, environmental damage, and public health. The policy question is no longer whether battery rickshaws should exist, but how quickly Dhaka can regulate them responsibly.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401303/study-warns-battery-rickshaws-dominate-dhaka%E2%80%99s", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 850}
{"title": "Mob violence undermines justice, minority leaders warn ahead of election", "body": "Speakers at CGS policy dialogue say rights, security and representation must be central to 2026 polls Mob violance and rising insecurity are undermining Bangladesh’s democratic foundations, speakers warned at a policy dialogue in Dhaka on Sunday, stressing that minority rights cannot be ensured without rule of law, political accountability and meaningful representation ahead of the 2026 national election. The Centre for Governance Studies (CGS) hosted the roundtable, titled “Democracy for All: Minority Rights, Representation and the National Election 2026,” at the CIRDAP auditorium in Dhaka at 3pm on Sunday. Representatives of minority communities, civil society members, academics, journalists and human rights activists attended the discussion, which focused on minorities’ lived experiences and the responsibilities of political parties to ensure safety, inclusion and credible electoral commitments. The speakers included Dr Sukomal Barua, adviser to the BNP chairperson; Nirmal Rozario, senior vice president of the Bangladesh Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Unity Council; Manindra Kumar Nath, acting general secretary; Jayanta Kumar Deb, president of the Dhaka Metropolitan Public Puja Committee; Bijan Kanti Sarkar, chairman of the Bangladesh Hindu-Buddhist-Christian Welfare Front; Khushi Kabir, coordinator of Nijera Kori; senior journalists Basudeb Dhar and Sohrab Hassan; Bangladesh Adivasi Forum leaders Sanjeeb Drong, Pallab Chakma and Ripon Chandra Banai; human rights activist Ilira Dewan; Dalit Parishad Dhaka division head Chandra Mohan Robidas; ULAB part-time lecturer Munni Marina Chiran; Brave Dimension Global president Mir Abu Reyad; and others. CGS President Zillur Rahman opened the dialogue by questioning the quality of democratic practice as the country approaches the 2026 election. “Democracy means a state where the voices of minorities are heard, even though they are fewer in number,” he said, arguing that the state must treat minorities as “assets” and uphold their dignity. Referring to the Liberation War, Zillur Rahman said independence was achieved collectively, yet electoral participation and security remain uncertain for many communities. “Will minorities be able to vote safely? Will representation be ensured? These are now open questions,” he said. Noting that minorities make up roughly 8% of the population, he criticized political parties for tokenism, saying minority representation is often ensured “only on paper” for political convenience. “Party manifestos must clearly address minority rights and electoral participation,” he said, adding: “Without democracy and rule of law, minority rights cannot be realized.” Dr Sukomal Barua questioned why separate institutions are required to protect certain communities if rights are meant to be universal. “If rights truly belong to all, why do we need separate Dalit, Adivasi, Christian or Buddhist organizations to protect them?” he asked, describing this reality as a reflection of widespread denial of fundamental rights. He called for collective action, stressing that freedom and protection must be equal for all citizens. Nirmal Rozario said minority rights are inseparable from human rights. “Minority rights are human rights. If minority rights are fully ensured, there should be no question about human rights,” he said. He warned that “voter politics” often turns against humanity and said democracy cannot survive without inclusive values fostered at home, in educational institutions, workplaces and public life. Rozario urged political leaders to embed minority issues in electoral commitments and ensure legal guarantees of security and parliamentary representation. Manindra Kumar Nath said minorities continue to face insecurity and discrimination, questioning the state’s willingness to listen. “The government lacks the mindset to hear minority issues,” he said, calling it deeply disappointing. Referring to continued persecution since 1971, he asked: “If religious hatred persists, how can we expect democracy and human rights?” He said fear silences many victims, warning that such silence is self-destructive. “I do not want to be seen as a minority,” he said. “I want the same rights as any citizen.” Several speakers highlighted mob violence and what they described as a breakdown of law enforcement. Jayanta Kumar Deb said the situation has moved beyond debate. “Mobocracy is taking the lives of minorities,” he said, questioning whether this reflects the ideals of the Liberation War. He alleged that minorities remain unable to vote freely due to fear, regardless of which political force is in power. Chandra Mohan Robidas said mob violence destroys the foundation of justice, warning that religious sentiment is being weaponised against Adivasi, Dalit and minority communities. “Every citizen must be able to vote freely and without fear,” he said. Khushi Kabir said the term “minority” itself reflects political processes that marginalize groups through systems and structures. “Democracy exists to protect all citizens, yet minorities remain excluded,” she said, noting that religious marginalization is also rising in neighbouring countries. She urged a shift towards equal dignity and opportunity for all. Basudeb Dhar questioned Bangladesh’s progress in institutionalizing secularism and minority rights since independence, noting that the 1972 constitution did not adequately address indigenous rights. He criticised political parties for repeatedly promising minority protections in manifestos since 2014 without meaningful delivery. He warned that religion continues to be used as a tool for power and said maintaining law and order during the upcoming election must be a priority. Adivasi Forum leaders Sanjeeb Drong and Pallab Chakma echoed similar concerns, saying electoral pledges rarely translate into action. Chakma urged political parties to engage directly with Adivasi communities rather than treating them as symbolic references in election documents. Ilira Dewan said the absence of minority rights in party manifestos undermines trust in future guarantees, questioning claims that “everyone is equal” amid decades of discrimination. Sohrab Hassan said advocates for minority rights are often labelled traitors, while those accused of land grabbing and forced displacement remain influential. “If such individuals retain power, prospects for change remain bleak,” he said. The dialogue also addressed structural exclusion in education and employment. Munni Marina Chiron said Adivasi youth often lack access to higher education despite talent, calling for targeted programs in skills development, employment, loans and entrepreneurship. Mir Abu Reyad said job advertisements typically recognize only “men and women,” excluding other communities and reinforcing invisibility. He highlighted discrimination faced by the Hijra community in healthcare and urged inclusive representation across sectors, including school textbooks. He also stressed housing security during disasters and called on parties to clearly address minority rights in their election manifestos. The discussion was moderated by CGS President Zillur Rahman.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401304/mob-violence-undermines-justice-minority-leaders", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 1022}
{"title": "Mahfuz Anam: Freedom of expression must be exercised responsibly", "body": "He said many people fail to fully understand the role of journalism in society, describing its core essence as providing a space for free expression Mahfuz Anam, editor of The Daily Star, has urged that freedom of expression—a core pillar of democracy—must be exercised responsibly, with opinions grounded in facts, research, and free from bias. He made the remarks while delivering the keynote address at the Professor Sitara Parvin Award ceremony on Sunday morning at the Muzaffar Ahmed Chowdhury Auditorium of Dhaka University. The Professor Sitara Parvin Trust awarded scholarships to 10 undergraduate students from the 2023 cohort of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism. Mahfuz said many people fail to fully understand the role of journalism in society, describing its core essence as providing a space for free expression. Noting historical trends, he said freedom of expression was suppressed for most of human civilization and began developing only in the last 80 to 90 years, flourishing mainly over the past five decades. “However, we are now witnessing a phase where this freedom is again being distorted,” he said. While freedom of expression is a fundamental right, Mahfuz stressed that it comes with accountability “Along with the right to say what I think comes a responsibility. Is my opinion well thought out? Is it based on research, study, and an understanding of society and people? Or am I merely expressing an emotional reaction?” he said. He described journalism as the institutional form of free expression, practiced in a structured and accountable manner through independent media. He said the role of journalism is to question power, adding that The Daily Star does not align with any political party but takes a clear stance on democracy, rule of law, human rights, and government accountability. “An elected government does not mean unlimited power,” he said. Addressing the challenges of the digital age, Mahfuz said social media presents both opportunities and dangers. While it has expanded access to platforms for expression and contributed to democratic development, verifying information from social media remains a major challenge. He warned that attacking individuals online infringes upon their democratic rights, stressing that freedom of expression must be balanced with respect for dignity and reputation—an awareness often lacking on social media. Mahfuz also highlighted the importance of financial independence for journalistic freedom, warning that economic dependence on owners or advertisers can undermine editorial independence. He said The Daily Star strives to build a sustainable and profitable institution through professional and ethical journalism. On accountability, he said the newspaper does not claim to be above mistakes and considers correcting errors and offering public apologies a professional responsibility, describing journalists as “social doctors” of society. Citing examples from environmental protection, water management, agriculture, and development, Mahfuz said journalism must critically examine development by highlighting both its benefits and harmful consequences. “If development destroys nature or harms future generations, it must be questioned,” he said. Addressing journalism students, he said the profession carries immense responsibility and that credibility is a journalist’s greatest asset. He urged aspiring journalists to enter the field with honesty, ethics, and human values. Dhaka University Pro-Vice Chancellor (Administration) Prof Saima Haque Bidisha attended the event as chief guest, while Prof Tayebur Rahman, dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences and acting chair of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism, presided over the program. Associate Professor Shawnti Haider highlighted the life and work of Prof Sitara Parvin, while Prof Ahaduzzaman Mohammad Ali, a faculty member of the department and the late Sitara Parvin’s husband, also spoke. Prof Sitara Parvin, a former professor of the Department of Mass Communication and Journalism at Dhaka University, died in a road accident in the United States on June 23, 2005, while travelling from Chicago to Kansas after attending a conference at the invitation of the International Women’s Media Foundation. Born on September 2, 1953, she was the daughter of former president Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed. She earned BA (Hons) and MA degrees in English Literature from Dhaka University, later completing an MA in Journalism and a PhD from the University of Bradford in England. She served as a professor at Dhaka University from 1982 until her death.

Ducsu Executive Member Hema Chakma made the announcement at a press conference held around 5:45pm today, Sunday, at Dhaka University’s central field. Also present were Ducsu’s Research and Publications Secretary Sanjida Ahmed Tonni, Shamsunnahar Hall Vice President Kaniz Qurratul Ain, and female students from various departments and halls. While reading the written statement, Hema Chakma said: \"For over a year now, female students at Dhaka University have been banned from entering the central playground after evening under the pretext of preventing absurd ‘indecency.’ Similarly, if female students are seen in various areas of the university including the mall area after 10pm, they are being forcibly removed.\" She added: \"This ban exists in no written policy, no public notice, and has no legal basis. The administration is implementing it illegally. In the name of security, questioning and harassment have become a regular reality.” Citing examples of male students freely moving, staying, and chatting in the same places, she added: “This double standard clearly shows that discrimination and harassment against female students are ongoing in the name of special security.” She further said: “We want to say clearly—restricting women’s right to move freely under the excuse of protection is structural discrimination against women. Until this discrimination is eliminated and a women-friendly campus is built, we will continue to hold the administration accountable.” In this context, she informed that female students have organized the symbolic program \"Burn the Administration BBQ\" on Sunday at the central playground and will submit a memorandum to the Proctor demanding a women-friendly campus. In response to a journalist’s question at the press conference, Israt Jahan Emu said: \"After Shammo’s murder, it was never said that boys cannot stay outside the hall after 10pm. After Tofazzal’s murder too, it was never said that boys should be kept in solitary confinement, otherwise they would kill each other. Similarly, just as women face harassment after 10pm at night, they also face harassment during the day.” She said the university administration should strengthen adequate security measures. “For this, it is necessary to increase the number of proctorial team members, increase regular patrol vehicles and patrols, and install CCTV cameras on campus,” Emu added. She also stressed: “Ensuring security is the responsibility of the administration and the state. So the administration cannot say that you should stay inside your home because there will be theft and robbery.” Earlier, allegations arose that female students were being barred from entering Dhaka University’s central field after evening through verbal instructions, even though there was no written policy. Several female students were stopped at the gate of the central field. They were told that female students cannot enter the field after 5pm. However, this ban does not apply to male students. Allegations of gender discrimination intensified over this incident and Ducsu leader Hema Chakma announced this protest program.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401306/du-female-students-stage-%E2%80%98burn-the-administration", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 516}
{"title": "Rizwana urges stopping unnecessary honking to curb noise pollution", "body": "Adviser said controlling noise requires behavioral change alongside law enforcement, inaugurates DoE–DMP awareness rally in Dhaka Syeda Rizwana Hasan, adviser for Information and Broadcasting and Environment, Forests and Climate Change on Saturday urged people from all walks of life to avoid unnecessary honking as part of efforts to control noise pollution. \"Honking without reason has become a deeply rooted bad habit over the years,\" she said, adding that curbing noise pollution requires not only strict enforcement of laws but also a change in public behavior. The adviser made the remarks while inaugurating a rally organized under the Department of Environment's ongoing Integrated and Partnership-based Project for Noise Pollution Control in Dhaka. The rally, jointly organized by the Department of Environment and the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), aimed to raise public awareness about noise pollution. With the slogan \"No More Noise Pollution, Let Healthy Life Prevail,\" the adviser formally launched the colorful procession. The rally started from Manik Mia Avenue (South Plaza of the National Parliament Building) in the morning, passed through Farmgate, Karwan Bazar, and Bijoy Sarani, and concluded at the Department of Environment in Agargaon. Dr Farhina Ahmed, secretary of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, attended the program. Adviser Rizwana highlighted that the Noise Pollution (Control) Rules, 2025, have already been gazetted. Under the rules, law enforcement responsibility now extends to the police alongside the Department of Environment, allowing immediate action against noise polluters since police personnel remain on the roads around the clock. She noted that several areas of Dhaka have been declared silent zones and stressed the importance of strengthening monitoring in these areas. The adviser identified unnecessary honking and fireworks as the two main sources of noise pollution currently being addressed. She added that initiatives will be taken to ensure fireworks are set off only at designated places during Pahela Baishakh. Expressing optimism, she said the next elected government would continue ongoing programs to control noise pollution. Rizwana also urged media professionals to actively raise public awareness, saying: \"I sincerely request you to voluntarily spread the message against unnecessary honking from your respective positions.\" Addressing young volunteers, she emphasized that a social movement against noise pollution is essential to protect future generations from hearing impairment. Dr Md Kamruzzaman, director general of the Department of Environment, and Md Sarwar, additional police commissioner of DMP, also spoke at the program.

They arrived at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport at 5:45 pm on Sunday on a Qatar Airways flight. Shariful Hasan, Associate Director of BRAC, said that through a joint initiative of the Migrant Welfare Desk and Civil Aviation Security, the returning workers were provided with transport assistance and other emergency support at the airport. Several of the returnees, including Mashiur Rahman from Gaibandha, Asmat Ali from Manikganj, Haiyul Mia from Mymensingh, Azadul Haque from Sirajganj, Prosenjit Rajbanshi from Dhaka, and Md Abdullah from Chapainawabganj, have alleged that they were defrauded in the name of overseas employment. They said that the average cost for each of them to travel to Russia was Tk 700,000. According to the workers, the recruiting company decided to terminate their employment and send them back to Bangladesh without providing any clear reason. They also said that the process of repatriating a total of 120 Bangladeshi workers after terminating their employment has already begun. As part of this process, 35 workers have returned in the first phase. The workers further alleged that in July last year they were sent to Russia through recruiting agency Kashipur Overseas (RL-1317) after obtaining clearance from the Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET). Although the clearance mentioned the Russian company Mars International Limited Trade Development, they were employed upon arrival by a different company—LLC Alabuga Development Company. Under the terms of their contracts, the workers were supposed to be employed as factory workers, but in practice they were made to work in building construction. The victims also said that while still in Bangladesh they were initially transferred through a travel agency named Jubayer Overseas and then handed over to the recruiting agency TPS-360 Bangladesh Limited (RL-995). This agency later completed all formalities and arranged the necessary BMET clearance. However, they alleged that TPS-360 Bangladesh Limited used another recruiting agency, Kashipur Overseas (RL-1317), in obtaining the BMET clearance. The affected workers have called on the relevant government authorities to intervene, investigate the matter and take legal action against those responsible.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/bangladesh-others/401290/35-workers-return-from-russia-after-losing-jobs", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 378}

After hearing arguments on Sunday, Judge Rabiul Alam of Dhaka’s Special Judge’s Court-4 fixed the date for delivering the verdict, confirmed Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Public Prosecutor Hafizur Rahman Hafiz. During the hearing, Advocate Hafizur Rahman presented arguments on behalf of the ACC and said the prosecution was seeking life imprisonment as the maximum punishment for the accused. Advocate Shahinur Islam, appearing for Khurshid Alam—the only accused currently in jail—argued that the ACC failed to prove the allegations and sought his acquittal. After hearing both sides, the court set February 2 for the verdict. Following the change of power on August 5 last year, allegations of corruption and irregularities during the Awami League government came to light. In this context, the ACC filed six cases in January last year over the allocation of a 60-katha plot in Rajuk’s Purbachal New Town project. Besides Sheikh Hasina, the accused in the cases include her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, daughter Saima Wazed Putul, sister Sheikh Rehana, niece and British MP Tulip Siddiq, Azmina Siddique Ruponti and nephew Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby. So far, verdicts have been delivered in four cases involving Sheikh Hasina—three exclusively against her and one involving Sheikh Rehana and Tulip Siddiq. Sheikh Hasina has been sentenced to a total of 26 years’ imprisonment in those cases, while Joy and Putul received five years each. Sheikh Rehana was sentenced to seven years and Tulip Siddiq to two years. In the present case, testimony from 18 witnesses, including Ruponti, concluded on January 13. Statements of a total of 28 witnesses were recorded against the 18 accused, including Bobby. During the defence hearing, Khurshid Alam pleaded innocence, while the remaining accused could not place self-defence statements as they remain absconding. The case was filed on January 13 last year by the ACC’s Integrated District Office-1 against 16 people, with Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby named as the principal accused, over alleged corruption in the allocation of a 10-katha plot in Purbachal. Following the investigation, a chargesheet was submitted against 18 accused on March 24, just over two months after the case was filed.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/corruption/401254/verdict-in-graft-case-against-hasina-tulip-bobby", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 417}

The petition was filed by independent Sucsu candidate Mominur Rashid Shuvo with the relevant branch of the High Court. The chief election commissioner and other concerned parties have been named as respondents in the writ petition. According to the petition, the Election Commission had issued directives to suspend all elections ahead of the national parliamentary election. Under such circumstances, holding the Sucsu election would not be lawful as the election is scheduled to be held on January 20. Meanwhile, the campaign period for candidates contesting the Sust central students’ union and hall union elections has been extended by 12 hours. The information was disclosed in a notice signed by Sust Chief Election Commissioner Abul Mukit Mokaddes. The notice said that campaigning by candidates was disrupted after the Bangladesh Election Commission suspended all elections nationwide on January 12. Subsequently, on January 15, the Election Commission granted permission to hold the Sucsu election on January 20, 2026. To facilitate campaigning, the deadline for electioneering has been extended until 9pm on January 18. Under the election code of conduct, campaigning is required to end 48 hours before polling, which meant the deadline had originally expired at 10pm on Saturday.

Confirming the incident, Gulshan Police Station Sub-Inspector Mofizul Islam said police reached the spot around 1am after receiving information and recovered the body.

People will speak in different ways, and it is very important to preserve this diversity,” he said in his welcome speech at the first-ever Media Convention 2026, organized by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) at the Krishibid Institution in Dhaka. Nurul Kabir said unity among media professionals is essential, alongside collective efforts to overcome challenges and promote democratic values across society. “Newspapers and other media institutions are not merely platforms for a few hundred journalists. If they become inactive or are unable to raise their voices, rights across the entire society are bound to be violated,” he said. He added that in any country, the development of the media and overall democratic progress are closely and inseparably linked. Referring to the current political context, Nurul Kabir said the country is passing through a transitional phase from an authoritarian system to a democratic one. “At a time when struggles are under way for democratic reform of the media, politics, and various state institutions, media organizations are being attacked,” he said. He also alleged that the spirit of the July movement was being distorted in its own name. “Those involved are trying to destroy the fundamental democratic spirit of July by using July itself,” he said, adding that unity and a conscious collective struggle are needed at such a critical time.

Addressing a gathering of leading accountants, he said, “Many of the country’s top accountants are present here today. I would request your cooperation so that such practices do not recur in the future and we can return to a different path.” He made the remark at the opening ceremony of the South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) International Conference, titled “The Profession for the Next Generation: Transforming Ethical AI and Sustainable Reporting,” held at Hotel Le Méridien in Dhaka. Touhid said that, as a responsible neighbor and active member of the United Nations and other international organizations, Bangladesh supports a rules-based international order and collective action to address global economic challenges. “We advocate active engagement to promote dialogue, build trust, and seek collaborative solutions to shared concerns,” he said. He expressed encouragement at seeing experts, practitioners, and thinkers from South Asia and beyond gathered at the conference, adding that their discussions would guide the next generation of professionals to emphasize integrity, accountability, and innovation. The foreign adviser noted that the world is experiencing rapid technological advancement, with artificial intelligence and digital innovation transforming professions globally, including his own. At the same time, the global community is placing increasing emphasis on sustainability, transparency, and ethical practices in business and governance. “For Bangladesh, the proposed integration of technology and sustainable capacity is particularly significant,” he said. “To achieve economic growth and deeper global integration, our professionals must not only be technically skilled but also ethically and socially responsible.” He concluded that platforms like this conference play a vital role in facilitating knowledge exchange, sharing best practices, and promoting meaningful collaboration, which can help guide both regional and international communities toward a stable, inclusive, and technologically advanced future.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/401206/foreign-adviser-banks-were-looted-in-broad", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 346}

There are serious questions surrounding journalists and many media outlets. That is why a Newspaper Standards Committee is urgently needed,” he said while speaking at the Media Conference–2026 organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) in the capital. Advising journalists to think pragmatically, Shafik Rehman said relying solely on journalism for livelihood has become increasingly difficult. “Given the current state of journalism, journalists should also consider alternative professions. Without another source of income, it is very hard to practise independent journalism in Bangladesh.” Expressing solidarity with the journalists’ unity demonstrated at the event, he said such collective initiatives were absent during periods when newspapers were shut down and journalists were arrested under past Awami League governments. “Even so, better late than never—we have finally realised the need to stand united.” Recalling his personal ordeal, Shafik Rehman said he lost sight in his left eye and hearing in his left ear during his time in jail. “I never sought personal publicity; I always wanted publicity for my newspaper.” Calling on journalists to free themselves from political allegiance, he criticised what he described as opportunistic shifts in loyalty. “Those who are now speaking against the Awami League were once aligned with the government during its tenure. Overnight, as if by magic, they became BNP supporters. This cannot be journalism. Journalists must come out of political subservience.” Shafik Rehman also voiced concern over Bangladesh’s economic trajectory, drawing a historical parallel with post-fascist Italy, where a collapse in the currency forced people to revert to barter trade. “I fear Bangladesh could head in that direction,” he warned, citing the proliferation of banks in the country. “The Awami League government has established 76 banks, while a country like England has only four.” Stressing professional accountability, the veteran journalist said meaningful change in Bangladesh’s media landscape would come only when journalists understand why they chose the profession, publishers recognise their responsibilities and editors remain fully conscious of their roles.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/401220/shafik-rehman-calls-for-formation-of-newspaper", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 406}

{"title": "EU EOM: We are here to observe, not to interfere", "body": "At full strength, the mission will comprise approximately 200 observers The European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) to Bangladesh on Saturday said it is in the country solely to observe the electoral process and will not interfere, as it deployed 56 long-term observers across all 64 administrative districts. Deputy Chief Observer Inta Lase said the observers are present only to monitor the elections. “We are here to observe, not to interfere. Long-term observers are a vital component of our mission. Their observations and insights will form the foundation of an impartial and evidence-based assessment of the electoral process,” she said. The EU EOM applies a structured and well-established methodology for long-term, nationwide observation, allowing for a balanced and comprehensive analysis of the electoral process. Long-term observers will closely monitor key aspects of the elections at the regional level and support the analytical work of the core expert team based in Dhaka. Lase said the observers will work in pairs and, within their assigned areas, meet voters, election officials, candidates, representatives of political parties, domestic observers, and youth activists. Their activities will extend beyond major cities to include smaller towns and rural areas. The observers have been drawn from EU member states, as well as Canada, Norway, and Switzerland. Prior to their deployment, they received extensive briefings on Bangladesh’s electoral process, political environment, legal framework, and media and social context. The mission has been deployed at the invitation of the Bangladeshi authorities. It is led by Member of the European Parliament and Chief Observer Evin Incir, who officially launched the mission’s activities at a press conference in Dhaka on January 11. As election day approaches, the mission will be reinforced by 90 short-term observers, along with observers from diplomatic missions of EU member states, Canada, Norway, and Switzerland. They will observe polling, vote counting, and the tabulation of results. A delegation from the European Parliament will also join the mission. At full strength, the mission will comprise approximately 200 observers. The EU Election Observation Mission will present its preliminary findings at a press conference in Dhaka on February 14. A final report, including recommendations, will be submitted to the authorities after completion of the entire electoral process.

{"title": "Ali Riaz: No legal bar for govt employees to campaign for ‘Yes’ vote", "body": "He said that the upcoming referendum is not aimed at bringing any political party to power or preventing any party from doing so Professor Ali Riaz, special assistant to the chief adviser has stated that there is no legal restriction preventing public servants from campaigning in favour of a \"Yes\" vote in the referendum. He said that the upcoming referendum is not aimed at bringing any political party to power or preventing any party from doing so. Rather, it is an agenda for state reform based on the July National Charter, written in blood and belonging to all the people of Bangladesh. The referendum, he added, is a process of seeking public consent through which the future direction of the country will be determined. Ali Riaz made these remarks on Saturday while addressing a meeting with divisional officials and representatives, organized to promote referendum awareness and voter motivation. The meeting was held in the morning at the Biam Foundation auditorium in the capital and was organized by the Dhaka Divisional Administration. Professor Ali Riaz said that discussions with constitutional experts, former judges and relevant legal professionals had produced a unanimous opinion that there is no legal prohibition on public servants campaigning in favour of a ‘Yes’ vote in the referendum. Those claiming otherwise, he said, are either spreading misinformation or raising the issue with ulterior motives. Referring to the period between 2009 and 2024, he said that those who fought against a personalized authoritarian system—those who sacrificed their lives, endured imprisonment, repression, enforced disappearances, killings and extrajudicial executions—have left behind two clear responsibilities. One is to ensure that such personalized autocracy never returns, and the other is to design the roadmap for Bangladesh’s future. He noted that one-third of Bangladesh’s population is under the age of 27 to 37 and that it is the responsibility of the present generation to determine how the country will progress over the next 40 years and to set it on a path towards rapid success and prosperity. Ali Riaz further stated that public servants are not only officials and employees of the Republic but also citizens. As such, their role in determining the future structure of the state is significant. Referring to Article 21 of the Constitution, he said it outlines the duty of public servants to serve the people at all times, as well as citizens’ responsibilities to uphold the law, maintain discipline and protect national assets. In this context, raising awareness about the referendum and encouraging voter participation should be regarded as part of civic duty. Addressing public confusion surrounding the referendum, speakers at the meeting said that, due to long-standing public mistrust in electoral processes, the referendum is a new experience for many people. Therefore, it is necessary to explain how to cast a ballot and what a \"Yes\" or \"No\" vote signifies. They added that the \"tick mark\" on the referendum ballot should be used as the main campaign symbol to encourage people to come to polling centres and cast their votes. Ali Riaz also said that the current interim government is working under three mandates arising from the July uprising 2024: reform, justice and elections. He clarified that the government does not conduct elections but creates a conducive environment, while the Election Commission administers the process. Similarly, the judiciary conducts trials, with the government ensuring an enabling environment for the judicial process. Referring to past constitutional amendments, he said that amendments had previously been made at the will of a single individual. He cited the Fifteenth Amendment, noting that a parliamentary committee was formed consisting only of members of the Awami League. Although the committee initially decided to retain the caretaker government system with certain conditions, this decision was later reversed in a meeting with the Prime Minister. As a result, the Fifteenth Amendment and the abolition of the caretaker government system were enacted based on the decision of one individual. He stressed that constitutional amendments must no longer be treated as a “child’s play”. In his address as a special guest, Monir Haider said that 48 recommendations on constitutional reform are being placed before the referendum under four categories. Although there are four categories, he said, the question is effectively one: whether the people support or oppose the July uprising. He warned that failure of the referendum would allow fascism to return, with consequences too horrific to imagine. Referring to the Proclamation of Independence, he said that the goal of the Liberation War was to establish a state based on equality, human dignity and social justice. He further added that unfortunately this goal has not been achieved over the past 54 years, as individuals and groups have abused independence for narrow self-interest. The July uprising, he said, has created an opportunity to realize the true objectives of the Liberation War, and that opportunity must now be seized through the referendum.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/401232/ali-riaz-no-legal-bar-for-govt-employees-to", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 812}

Hundreds of Chhatra Dal activists gathered in front of and around the Election Commission, positioning themselves outside the EC’s security cordon and chanting slogans. The program was led by Chhatra Dal President Rakibul Islam. In response, law enforcement presence was strengthened in and around the EC premises. Members of the police, Navy, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) and Ansar were deployed, while riot control vehicles and water cannons were placed near the building to maintain law and order. Chhatra Dal said it surrounded the EC on three main grounds: what it termed biased and questionable decisions regarding postal ballots; alleged political interference in the commission’s decision-making process; and the issuance of what it called an unprecedented and controversial notification concerning the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology Student Union election, allegedly under the influence of a particular political party. Addressing the protest, Chhatra Dal President Rakibul Islam alleged that a specific political group had exerted undue influence over postal ballots and that the EC had acted with its encouragement. He claimed that despite reports of possible corrections, the commission’s actions had once again humiliated student organisations, similar to incidents surrounding student union and hall elections at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology. He also criticised the postal ballot distribution process, likening it to letters being left at a common point in student dormitories for anyone to collect, claiming that around 160 ballots were kept in a single box and later distributed among expatriate voters. The protest follows widespread discussion and criticism after a video showing a large number of postal ballots delivered to a single address in Bahrain went viral on social media. In response to the controversy, the Election Commission clarified the matter on January 14. EC Secretariat Senior Secretary Akhtar Ahmed said that postal ballots are sent through the Universal Postal Union and that postal systems differ across countries, particularly in the Middle East. He explained that in Bahrain, around 160 ballots were left in one place in a single box due to the local postal system.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/401258/chhatra-dal-surrounds-ec-over-alleged-political", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 382}

In the complaint, Mamun Howlader urged the EC to strictly comply with High Court rulings on dual citizenship. He cited Article 66(2)(c) of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Order, 1972, which bar foreign nationals or dual citizens from contesting parliamentary elections. Referring to a High Court order (Writ Petition No 16463/2023), he noted that an individual remains a foreign citizen until renunciation is formally accepted, and that merely applying for renunciation is insufficient—a position upheld by the Appellate Division. The complaint alleges that during recent appeal hearings, the EC accepted only affidavits from dual citizens stating that their citizenship renunciation was “under process” and, on that basis, declared their nominations valid, in violation of constitutional provisions and the High Court’s ruling. Mamun Howlader further alleged that the EC is unlawfully accepting reviews of its own appellate decisions and urged the CEC not to validate any nomination of a dual citizen without final legal proof of renunciation of foreign citizenship.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/401275/allegations-of-constitutional-violation-over-dual", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 214}

He said the police force is fully prepared to ensure that the upcoming national parliamentary election is held in a free, fair and neutral manner. About 100,000 police personnel have been given special training to ensure security during the election, he added. The adviser instructed police officers to maintain strict neutrality while performing election duties and not to accept any unethical benefits or hospitality. If any disorder arises at polling centres, it must be dealt with firmly in accordance with the advice of the returning officer, he said. Mentioning that various pressures and criticisms may arise in professional life, Jahangir Alam said honesty and patriotism can help overcome any obstacle in carrying out duties. He called for building a humane, courageous and proud police force free from corruption and bias, upholding the sacrifices of the people and the expectations of future generations.

The incident occurred on Saturday night at the university’s central field, where Abul Khair Tobacco Company set up a stall to distribute complimentary cigarettes. The distribution violates Section 6(b) of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Usage (Control) Act 2005 (amended in 2013), which stipulates that the sale of tobacco and tobacco products within 100 metres of educational institutions, hospitals, clinics, sports facilities and children’s parks is punishable by a fine of Tk5,000. It also violates Sections 5(b) and 5(c) of the same Act, which prohibit the free distribution of tobacco products and the sponsorship of events by tobacco companies. Violations of the Act carry penalties of up to three months’ imprisonment, fines of up to Tk1,00,000, or both. The government also recently increased fines for smoking in public places from Tk300 to Tk2,000 on December 30. Regarding responsibility for the incident, Ducsu Literature and Culture Secretary Musaddik Ali Ibne Mohammad told Dhaka Tribune that he was only aware of a designated “smoking zone” at the event and was unaware of the free distribution of cigarettes. He said the arrangement may have been made by Ducsu’s co-organizer, Spirit of July.

In Bangladesh's current transitional moment, the statement said, silence would not represent neutrality, it would represent a failure of leadership. Bangladesh's interim government was not constituted merely to administer routine state functions or to act as a passive electoral caretaker, the statement noted, saying it emerged from an acute governance and legitimacy crisis, marked by sustained public protest, institutional breakdown, and a collapse of confidence in political processes. Its mandate-understood domestically and communicated clearly to international partners-has been to stabilize the state, restore democratic credibility, and deliver a credible framework of reforms before returning authority to an elected government, it read. \"Professor Yunus, as the chief adviser, has spent the past eighteen months leading an unprecedented process of consultation across political parties, civil society, professional groups, and youth constituencies,\" the statement said, adding, the reform package now before the electorate is the product of that process. \"To suggest that he should now refrain from advocating for these reforms is to misunderstand the very purpose of the interim arrangement,\" the statement said, adding, an interim authority entrusted with reform cannot plausibly be expected to disown that reform at the moment of democratic decision.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/government-affairs/401263/govt-clarifies-ca%E2%80%99s-support-for-%E2%80%98yes%E2%80%99-vote-in", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 333}

The interns said they would continue their protest until workplace security was guaranteed and those responsible are held accountable. The incident occurred around 10pm on Friday when three patients arrived simultaneously at Ward-6 seeking admission. An attendant of one patient allegedly pressured the on-duty intern doctor to expedite the admission process, sparking an argument involving doctors and nurses. The dispute reportedly escalated into physical violence, during which relatives of the patient assaulted on-duty staff. Several staff members were injured, and a female intern doctor was harassed. In response, intern doctors initially detained three individuals, including a woman, suspected of involvement. Another source alleged that the detainees were later assaulted by hospital staff. Police arrived later that night and took the three into custody. Two are receiving treatment at a private hospital, while one remains in police custody. Hospital authorities have formed a separate medical team to ensure continuity of healthcare services. Deputy Director Dr Mahbubur Alam said the strike began the night of the incident, with interns demanding both security and punishment of the offenders. He emphasized that ensuring the safety of intern doctors is a priority and confirmed that legal proceedings were underway. Sylhet Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner (media) Mohammad Saiful Islam said police teams responded and remained deployed to maintain order, with investigations ongoing.

{"title": "Degraded airshed declaration remains on paper as brick kiln pollution threatens public health", "body": "According to the DoE, Savar’s annual air quality is nearly three times worse than the nationally prescribed standards Illegal brick kilns, identified as a major source of air pollution in Dhaka, continue posing serious threats to the environment and public health in Savar. Despite the Department of Environment (DoE) declaring Savar a degraded airshed last year due to the severity of pollution, the decision has had little impact on the ground. According to the DoE, Savar’s annual air quality is nearly three times worse than the nationally prescribed standards. Although drives are periodically carried out, most brick kilns reportedly resume operations shortly after raids conclude. Professor AKM Rashidul Alam of Department of Environmental Sciences at Jahangirnagar University said that the region’s Air Quality Index (AQI) is more than double the normal level. Emissions of sulphur dioxide and ultrafine particulate matter from coal-fired illegal brick kilns are significantly worsening air pollution, increasing the risks of respiratory diseases, breathing difficulties and even cancer, he added. On November 5 last year, the Department of Environment dismantled the kilns of several brick fields in Shimulia area of Ashulia. However, local residents allege that within two months, new kilns were constructed and brick production resumed. They have said that symbolic actions are insufficient, stressing that permanent closure of illegal brick kilns requires strong political will and continuous monitoring. Otherwise, they said, Savar’s polluted air will further deteriorate the overall air quality of capital Dhaka in the long term. Local resident Nizam Uddin said he had hoped the problem was permanently resolved after the kilns were demolished. “Seeing the kilns operating again is deeply frustrating,” he said, adding that there is no clear answer as to how or under whose permission the kilns restarted operations. Another resident, Md Kamal Hossain, pointed out that although environmental protection laws exist in Bangladesh, ordinary citizens lack clear legal standing to file cases. Even when directly affected by environmental damage, people often cannot seek redress in court. He called for amendments to environmental laws to ensure affected citizens have the right to pursue legal action, similar to other key legislations. The intense heat and ash emitted from brick kilns are also reducing the fertility of nearby agricultural land. Additionally, the use of firewood as fuel is contributing to the destruction of social forestry. Rajib Raihan, a student of environmental sciences at Jahangirnagar University, said that breathing in the area has become increasingly difficult due to smoke billowing from brick kilns. “Respiratory illnesses such as asthma and pneumonia are rising among children and the elderly,” he said, adding that both farmland and forest resources are facing severe degradation. Responding to the allegations, Rezwan-ul-Islam, an executive magistrate of the Department of Environment, said regular monitoring is being conducted. He explained that many kilns are manually operated rather than mechanized, allowing them to restart operations quickly. He warned that brick kilns constructing new chimneys would face additional legal cases and, if necessary, strict measures including direct arrests. According to the Department of Environment, of the approximately 107 brick kilns operating in Savar upazila, only two use environmentally friendly technology.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401229/degraded-airshed-declaration-remains-on-paper-as", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 516}
{"title": "On Sonadia Island, education ends at grade five", "body": "Sonadia has only one government primary school, where around 220 to 250 students are currently enrolled Before dawn breaks over the Bay of Bengal, ten-year-old Masum wakes to the sound of waves crashing against Sonadia Island. He picks up his schoolbooks and prepares for another day at Sonadia Government Primary School, fully aware that his education has a fixed end point. Masum is a fourth-grade student. He knows that once he completes grade five, there will be nowhere left for him to study. “I want to study further,” he says quietly. “But there is no school here for us.” Like the sea that surrounds his home, Masum’s dreams rise and fall repeatedly - cut short by geography, poverty and the absence of basic educational infrastructure. Such stories are common on Sonadia Island, a remote landmass of about nine square kilometres off Maheshkhali in Cox’s Bazar, surrounded entirely by the sea. Life here is shaped by tides, saline water and constant hardship. Houses made of bamboo and polythene reflect the island’s fragile living conditions. Despite this, nearly every family wants their children to receive an education. Yet formal schooling on the island ends at grade five. Sonadia has only one government primary school, where around 220 to 250 students are currently enrolled. Each year, an average of 25 to 30 students pass grade five, after which most are forced to drop out. There is no secondary school on the island. Travelling to the upazila town for education is costly, risky and often impossible. Boat services are limited and unsafe, and during rough weather, communication with the mainland almost entirely breaks down. Reaching Sonadia from Cox’s Bazar jetty requires crossing open sea routes. Parents say that even if they wish to send their children elsewhere to study, the lack of reliable transport makes it unrealistic. The school has six to seven teachers, but none reside on the island. As they commute from distant locations, classes are frequently disrupted. Teacher shortages and communication barriers have left the education system fragile. Tanvir, who passed grade five last year, is no longer studying. “There is no high school here,” he says. “After grade five, studying is not possible.” He speaks positively about his teachers but sees no path forward. Current students are also aware that grade five marks the end of their education. Still, many dream of becoming doctors, teachers or government officials. For most, those dreams remain unreachable. Once schooling ends, children typically join family work. Some accompany their fathers to sea fishing, while others help with salt farming or dried fish production. Agriculture is nearly impossible due to saline soil, leaving fishing and tourism as the main livelihoods. As tourism expands on the island, child labour has become increasingly visible. Children who drop out of school are often seen working at resorts, guesthouses and small shops - carrying luggage, cleaning rooms or helping in kitchens. Twelve-year-old Rashed (pseudonym) passed grade five but could not continue his studies. He now works at a resort from morning until evening. “I wanted to go to school,” he says. “But there is no high school here. If I don’t work, my family cannot survive.” Local residents warn that easy access to low-paid work is pulling children away from classrooms and into labour at an early age. Parents say they are powerless. “Even if we want to send our children outside the island, we cannot afford food and accommodation costs,” said Asma, a mother of two. Teachers share similar concerns. Mohammad Moktar, a teacher at Sonadia Government Primary School, said instruction continues under severe limitations. “There is no lack of effort from teachers,” he said. “But without a high school, students cannot move forward. Only a few families can afford to send their children to the upazila town.” Maheshkhali Upazila Executive Officer Imran Mahmud Dalim said there is a school up to grade eight in Gutibhanga, which Sonadia students are advised to attend. However, he acknowledged that very few can do so due to poverty and distance. “Sonadia is a backward area,” he said. “Most families depend on fishing, and many children join work immediately after grade five.” The crisis on Sonadia reflects a broader national challenge. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, around 1.77 million children in Bangladesh are engaged in child labour, largely in risky and informal sectors. The International Labour Organization (ILO) and Unicef identify poverty, limited access to education and weak enforcement as key drivers of child labour - problems that are especially acute in coastal and remote regions. Professor Abrar Hossain of the University of Dhaka said legal frameworks alone cannot solve the issue. “Without quality education and reliable communication in remote areas, children will continue to drop out,” he said. Sonadia Island is known for its natural beauty - sea beaches, keora forests, mangroves, dried fish hubs and even the prospect of a deep-sea port. Yet beneath this scenic surface lies a silent education crisis. Local residents say the solution is clear: establish a secondary school on the island or ensure safe, affordable transport to the mainland. Without urgent intervention, they warn, the dreams of children like Masum will continue to disappear - lost to the waves long before they reach the shore of opportunity.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401233/on-sonadia-island-education-ends-at-grade-five", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 874}

Speaking as the chief guest at a workshop titled “Aspirations of the Mass Uprising, Reforms and Elections” at the RDRS auditorium in Rangpur on Saturday, Majumdar said the core ideals of democracy, socialism and secularism—on which Bangladesh was founded in 1971—have never been fully implemented. He added that the framework agreed upon by the three political alliances during the 1990 uprising was also never realised. Referring to proposed reforms, Majumdar said that a “yes” vote would mean support for reform, while a “no” vote would amount to supporting the old political structure that enabled Sheikh Hasina to become authoritarian. He stressed that Sheikh Hasina did not seize power through military force, but rather became autocratic by using the constitution and introducing fundamental changes to it. He further noted that responsibility for reforms largely lies with political parties. Whether an authoritarian structure persists, he said, depends on the democratic values and political culture of those parties. Majumdar said that if political parties demonstrate democratic attitudes ahead of elections, stop the use of black money, and if the media can report impartially, free and fair elections are possible. However, he cautioned that elections alone are not sufficient, describing them merely as the beginning of a democratic journey. To ensure genuine democracy, he said, politics must be cleansed, the influence of money curbed, civil society and the media must act as watchdogs, and the Election Commission must be strengthened to guarantee a level playing field. Dr Majumdar also emphasised that free and credible elections alone are not enough for democratic transition; structural reforms are essential. In this context, he said, a referendum is extremely important, and added that the government faces no obstacle in campaigning for a “yes” vote in a referendum based on expert opinions. Earlier, leaders from SUJON’s eight district units in the Rangpur division participated in the workshop. Among those present were Jamaat-e-Islami’s Rangpur-3 candidate Mahbubar Rahman Belal, BSD candidate Abdul Quddus, SUJON Rangpur district president Professor Khairul Anam, metropolitan general secretary Zobaidul Islam Bullet, and others.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401235/badiul-expectations-of-both-1971-and-1990-remain", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 412}

The swim began at 9:35am on Saturday from the western beach of Shah Porir Dwip in Teknaf and is expected to finish at the northern beach of St Martin’s Island. The Bangla Channel forms part of the sea route between Teknaf and St Martin’s Island and measures about 16.1 kilometres. This is the 19th time the event has been organised. The swim was inaugurated by Cox’s Bazar District Sports Officer Alauddin and is being organised by Saroj Adventure as part of the government-backed Youth Festival, under the Ministry of Youth and Sports. Among the participants is Saiful Islam Russell, a former member of Dhaka University Central Students’ Union, who has previously crossed the Bangla Channel six times and completed a double crossing in 2021. In 2023, he finished first after completing the swim in three hours and 50 minutes. Speaking ahead of the event, Saiful said he was attempting to win the crossing for a seventh time, despite what he described as challenging sea conditions. Lipton Sarkar, chief executive of Saroj Adventure and widely known for completing multiple Bangla Channel crossings himself, said the swim was being conducted in line with international open-water swimming standards. He said safety arrangements included support boats and rescue personnel for each swimmer. Organisers said the event aims to raise awareness about drowning prevention, promote adventure sports and help introduce the Bangla Channel to an international audience alongside Cox’s Bazar, home to the world’s longest natural sea beach. The Bangla Channel swim was first attempted in 2006 under a plan devised by the late scuba diver and cinematographer Kazi Hamidul Haque. Since 2012, it has been listed as an international open-water long-distance swimming event.

BNP leaders and activists played an active role at every level, but people from all classes and professions also participated,” he said. Dr Zahid made the remarks while speaking at a winter clothes distribution programme for poor and orphaned students, organised by the Hakimpur Upazila, Dinajpur and Municipality BNP units at noon. “If anyone tries to claim sole credit for the uprising, it will not succeed. The people of the country stand with those who fought together,” he added.

{"title": "Despite profitability, Betna Express handed over to private operator", "body": "Railway officials said that the decision was taken in line with policy and aimed at generating higher revenue than current earnings Despite earning profits, Bangladesh Railway has handed over the operation of Betna Express train, running on the Benapole–Khulna–Mongla route, to the private sector, triggering dissatisfaction among the passengers in the southwestern region. H&M Trading Corporation, a private company, has assumed responsibility for the train’s commercial and ticket management since January 11, 2026. The route, previously operated under government management, was generating steady profits. The decision to lease it out has raised concerns among commuters and service seekers. Railway sources said that Bangladesh Railway issued a tender on April 22, 2025 to lease ticket management for the route. The tender was opened on May 19 and after evaluation in the first week of June, the proposal was forwarded to the railway’s evaluation committee. After scrutiny, H&M Trading Corporation was awarded a three-year contract. Benapole Railway Stationmaster Aynal Hasan said that train fares would remain unchanged despite the shift to private management. However, he noted a significant change in the operating schedule. The train, which previously remained off service on Tuesdays, will now operate seven days a week. Railway officials said that the decision was taken in line with policy and aimed at generating higher revenue than current earnings. Mihir Kumar Guha, Chief Commercial Manager of Bangladesh Railway at Pakshi, said that railway rules allow leasing if a private firm guarantees revenue higher than the average income of the previous six months. Bangladesh Railway retains the authority to cancel the lease if necessary, he added. Local residents have claimed that the leasing process has been completed quietly, without public consultations, possibly to avoid protests. They also fear that private management could result in fewer coaches, overcrowding and increased passenger hardship. They have called on the railway authorities to intervene. Passengers, however, said that the train currently earns Tk 35 lakh to Tk 40 lakh per month, adding that revenue could be increased further under government management by deploying more ticket checkers at railway stations. “It takes three to three-and-a half hours to travel from Khulna to Benapole by bus at a cost of Tk 250. The commuter train takes about two and a half hours and costs only Tk 45 to Tk 50,” said passenger Saiful Islam Sayeed. Another passenger, Mahmudul Hasan Nabil, said that private management could lead to a decline in service quality and increased influence of smugglers. He urged the railway authorities to withdraw the service from private control and return it to government management. Humayun Ahmed, owner of H&M Trading Corporation, said his company had formally received the contract and that the handover of the train had been planned earlier. Implementation was delayed due to budgetary and administrative issues, he said, adding that the train has been operating under private ticket management since Sunday. The Benapole–Khulna–Mongla route was launched in 1999 and operated under government management until 2010. It was later leased to private operators—Banna Enterprise and Islam Ship Builders—before being returned to government control in 2013 amid allegations of declining service quality and growing smuggling activity. In 2017, the authorities concerned increased services to two daily trips, citing the route’s strategic importance.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401243/despite-profitability-betna-express-handed-over", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 536}
{"title": "Securing a sensitive coastline: Navy tightens grip around Saint Martin’s island", "body": "Naval officials say this year-round deployment is intend ed to both protect the island and respond swiftly to emerging threats at sea Anyone visiting Saint Martin’s Island today is likely to see a Bangladesh Navy ship anchored just off the shoreline, symbolizing an unbroken military presence on one of the country’s most strategically sensitive maritime frontiers. Naval officials say this year-round deployment is intended to both protect the island and respond swiftly to emerging threats at sea. “The Navy remains on guard around Saint Martin’s Island at all times. Any threat or untoward incident is immediately addressed by the Navy,” a Navy officer serving at Saint Martin’s Island told Dhaka Tribune on Thursday, requesting anonymity. Saint Martin’s, Bangladesh’s only coral island, is strategically located near international maritime boundaries and key regional shipping lanes. Describing Saint Martin’s as extremely important and strategic, the officer said the Navy remains fully prepared 24 hours a day, with several vessels usually deployed in the surrounding waters. Located on north-eastern part of the Bay of Bengal, the island covers about 8 square kilometres. Naval personnel maintain 24-hour radar surveillance to prevent illegal intrusion or threats from neighbouring countries, particularly Myanmar. According to international maritime law, Bangladesh has sovereignty over its territorial sea up to 12 nautical miles, can enforce laws in a contiguous zone up to 24 nautical miles, and holds rights to explore and manage resources in an exclusive economic zone extending up to 200 nautical miles from the coast. Currently Navy has deployments in two forward bases and three contingents in the Cox's Bazar district alone. The Navy’s posture around Saint Martin’s and the Teknaf coast has also been shaped by escalating instability just across the maritime boundary in Myanmar’s Rakhine State, where the Arakan Army has expanded control and clashed with both junta forces and Rohingya armed groups. Security assessments note that fighting and stray gunfire from the Myanmar side, as well as reported abductions of Bangladeshi fishermen by Arakan Army fighters in recent years, have heightened the need for constant vigilance along the sea and land borders facing Rakhine. Officials said coordination among the Navy, BGB, Coast Guard, and other agencies along the stretch from Teknaf to Saint Martin’s waters is intensified to prevent cross-border incursions, while reassuring coastal communities and tourists. While talking with Dhaka Tribune, a senior Navy officer said: \"There is a thin maritime line between Myanmar and Bangladesh at a point of the Naaf River beside Teknaf. Sometimes, fishermen cross that line and enter Myanmar's water boundary, which is why incidents of abduction of fishermen occur.\" “We are raising awareness among our fishermen so that they cannot cross the maritime boundary, but sometimes fishermen do make mistakes. There’s no way that any other country will abduct our citizens from our water boundary,” that official stressed. Naval officials say they are also working to counter rumours and misinformation circulating about security activities and future plans for Saint Martin’s Island, which they claim are creating unnecessary fear and confusion among locals and potential visitors. They stress that unverified reports shared on social media about evacuations, large-scale militarization or restrictions on access to the island are baseless, urging the public to rely on official statements rather than speculation. “There is a lot of propaganda surrounding St Martin’s Island. Claims that the island is being taken over by another country are completely baseless and spread using edited images and videos from routine bilateral naval exercises,” a Navy Officer stationed at Saint Martin’s said. He added that the Navy regularly conducts joint and bilateral exercises with foreign navies to build professional capacity and mutual understanding. “Our Navy operates according to international standards, and these exercises help us identify areas for improvement,” he said. Navy personnel conduct day-and-night maritime patrols to prevent illegal transport, enforce bans on prohibited nets, and monitor suspicious movements. Earlier this month, a Navy warship intercepted a wooden trawler carrying 273 people approximately 30 nautical miles southwest of Saint Martin’s. According to naval sources, the passengers were attempting to leave Bangladesh illegally, with traffickers promising transport to Malaysia. Women and children were among those on board, and the boat lacked basic life-saving equipment, food, or drinking water. All 273 detainees, including suspected traffickers, were handed over to Teknaf police and local authorities for legal action. Beyond Saint Martin’s, the Navy has intensified operations in Teknaf under In Aid to Civil Power after the July–August mass uprising. Teknaf is considered a high-risk area for drug trafficking, human trafficking, and illegal arms trade. Since February last year, naval contingents have conducted 70 targeted special operations, including 34 unilateral and 36 joint operations across land, river, and coastal areas. These operations led to the seizure of 1,45,572 yaba tablets, crystal meth, cannabis, 600 litres of illicit liquor, 25,000 litres of raw alcohol materials, 31 locally made firearms, eight foreign pistols, 10 grenades, and ammunition. More than 200 trafficking victims were rescued, while 28 suspects were arrested during Operation Devil Hunt. Officials serving at the Taknaf Naval Contingent said such seizures underscore the Teknaf–Cox’s Bazar coastal belt as a nexus for overlapping criminal activities linked to trafficking networks on both sides of the border. The Navy also provides humanitarian support on Saint Martin’s as the island’s 20-bed hospital lacks doctors and X-ray facilities, prompting regular free medical camps. During natural disasters, such as the May 25 cyclone, the Navy rapidly delivers food, relief, and winter supplies to the islanders. In maritime accidents, Navy personnel regularly conduct immediate rescue operations. While visiting the island last week, it was observed that members of the Naval Forward base St Martin’s were distributing warm clothes among the poor islanders on Thursday at their base. With the 13th national election approaching, the Navy’s deployments also aim to ensure a safe and peaceful environment for voters. “To ensure that the general public can exercise their constitutional right to vote freely and safely, every member of the Bangladesh Navy will remain fully alert, professional, and committed to their duties,” a senior officer said, emphasizing adherence to the rule of law.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401267/securing-a-sensitive-coastline-navy-tightens-grip", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 1010}
{"title": "Gopalganj faces rabies vaccine shortage", "body": "The shortage has also affected private pharmacies, where the vaccine is rarely available An acute shortage of anti-rabies vaccines in Gopalganj over the past 17 days has put hundreds of lives at risk as government hospitals have failed to provide the life-saving injection to victims of animal bites. As rabies is a fatal disease, timely administration of anti-rabies vaccine is the only effective means of preventing infection. Although the vaccine is normally distributed free of charge through government hospitals, patients bitten by dogs, cats, and wild animals are now being turned away due to the ongoing supply crisis. According to the Gopalganj Civil Surgeon’s Office, six hospitals in the district usually distribute around 6,000 doses of anti-rabies vaccine every month under a government programme. On average, nearly 200 patients received the vaccine daily. However, due to supply disruption for the last 17 days, not a single patient has been vaccinated at government facilities. The shortage has also affected private pharmacies, where the vaccine is rarely available. Patients allege that taking advantage of the crisis, some pharmacies are selling the vaccine at inflated prices. A vaccine that normally costs Tk 500 is reportedly being sold for up to Tk 800 in some shops. Victims and their families have voiced deep concern. Meazzem Hossain, a resident of Chandradighalia village in Sadar upazila and father of dog-bite victim Sakib Hossain, said, “A dog has bitten my son, but we did not receive the vaccine at the hospital. Most pharmacies did not have it either. I finally found one shop selling the vaccine for Tk 800. This crisis must be resolved immediately.” Urfi Hosne Ara Begum, mother of cat-bite victim Hridoy Ahmed from Gopalganj Sadar, said rabies remains a deadly threat. “Once symptoms appear, survival is rare. Preventive vaccines must be ensured. After searching many places, I managed to buy the vaccine at a higher price and have it administered. Authorities concerned must restore normal supply without delay,” she said. Pharmacy owners also cited supply issues. Amit Ghosh, owner of New Nupur Pharmacy in Batasapatti area, said pharmaceutical companies had not supplied anti-rabies vaccines for the last six months. “As a result, we have had no stock, and the shortage continues in pharmacies,” he added. Dr Jibitesh Biswas, superintendent of the 250-bed Gopalganj General Hospital, said the hospital earlier received between 600 and 700 doses per cycle, which was later reduced to 200–300 doses before supply was completely halted. “Patients bitten by dogs, cats, and wild animals are coming here daily but returning without vaccination. We have formally informed higher authorities and requested immediate supply,” he said. Acknowledging the crisis, Gopalganj Civil Surgeon Dr Abu Sayed Mohammad Faruk said the matter had been reported to higher authorities. “We expect the vaccine supply to normalize soon. To prevent overpricing, mobile courts will be conducted to ensure that no one charges excessive prices,” he said.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401300/gopalganj-faces-rabies-vaccine-shortage", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 479}
{"title": "Women busy drying paddy in Gazipur", "body": "Despite round-the-clock work, their fatigue is tempered by the joy of harvesting paddy they cultivated themselves Rural women are now very busy drying paddy in Sreepur upazila of Gazipur. Despite round-the-clock work, their fatigue is tempered by the joy of harvesting paddy they cultivated themselves. In mid-Poush, they are passing busy time in drying paddy after cutting and threshing amid winter chill. Even though labour shortages and rising wages for workers have increased production costs, bumper yield has eased their worries. With paddy drying nearly complete, preparations are underway for its storage and marketing. Local markets are also gearing up for seasonal trade, with brisk buying and selling of paddy, straw and other agricultural products. Farmers hope fair prices this year will reward their year-long efforts. In the past, farmers prepared special drying floors (khola) by leveling land and plastering it with a mixture of earth and cow dung. Such scenes are now rare. Paddy is dried on tarpaulins or jute sheets laid out in open fields or small flat spaces, allowing quick protection from sudden rain or storms. Afroza Akter, a housewife from Bindubari village in Rajabari union, said, “Paddy has been harvested recently. We’ve finished making flour from rice. Now we’ll invite our daughters and sons-in-law. Our grandchildren will visit our house, and we’ll enjoy pithas together.” Momtaj Begum from Baldighat village in Kawraid said that the season brings a variety of traditional foods—bhapa, chitai, and savory pithas, along with payesh made from date palm juice. “But with paddy prices a bit low this year, the celebrations feel muted in some places,” she added. Farmer Jalil Mia of Abdar village said that although new paddy prices are slightly lower, relatives still look forward to the harvest. “Even if not elaborate, we will celebrate Nabanna on a small scale, as we do every year,” he said. Abdul Karim, a farmer from Goldapara village, said favourable weather conditions and timely harvesting led to satisfactory Aman production this year. “With threshing and drying underway, a festive mood has spread across the villages,” he noted. Mariam Akter, a woman farmer, said she cultivated Aman on three bighas of land and achieved higher yields than last year. “We’ve been harvesting for two days. I stayed up all night parboiling paddy. This morning we brought it to the field, spread nets, and set it to dry. The sky is clearing—everything should dry well. There’s no worry until the Boro season,” she said. Hasna Begum, another woman farmer, described paddy drying as strenuous work that requires standing in the sun and turning the grains repeatedly. “But once the harvest comes in, all hardship fades. We are working together—teamwork speeds things up,” she said. While changing times and challenges have slightly dampened festive fervour in some areas, many traditions endure in this agriculture-dependent land. Climate change has increased risks for farming, but with hard work and the use of improved technologies, farmers continue to seek the golden smile of a successful harvest—an encouraging sign as modern methods increasingly shape agricultural practices.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401307/women-busy-drying-paddy-in-gazipur", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 505}

He made the remarks during a discussion with family members of individuals who were victims of enforced disappearances, killings, and torture under the previous governments. The meeting was held at the China-Bangladesh Friendship International Conference Center in the capital. The event was jointly organized by Mayer Dak and Amra BNP Paribar and attracted family members of victims from across the country. At the start of the program, Tarique exchanged greetings with participants and comforted relatives who were tearful. “Due to the obligations of the Election Commission, BNP cannot reveal in detail its plans for the future of Bangladesh. However, the EC has taken some controversial steps. In this situation, we want to demonstrate patience as a political party,” he said. The BNP chairman also warned against attempts to obstruct the democratic process. “Many people are speaking in various ways to hinder the journey of democracy. BNP leaders and activists must remain vigilant. If the opportunity to establish democracy is lost this time, it would be a disrespect to the martyrs. The nightmarish situation of abductions and killings of the past has ended. In the future, BNP will stand by the families of the victims,” he said. Reflecting on the hardships faced by victims’ families, he added: “In past days, we went through a very difficult period. Today, many children have spoken here about their mothers. Among us are children who have not even seen their fathers once. Perhaps their difficult times will ease, but many will continue to live with the pain of their abducted relatives.” Highlighting BNP activists’ long-standing efforts, Tarique Rahman said: “If one brother in a family was tortured, another came out to the streets. BNP leaders and activists have never operated in secret under the guise of strategy. Therefore, no future conspiracy against us will succeed.” Emotional moments followed as relatives of victims recounted how their loved ones were taken from homes, offices, or streets, with many still unaware of their fate. Several children brought photos of their fathers and broke down in tears upon seeing Tarique Rahman, hugging him tightly. Tarique Rahman himself could not hold back tears and comforted them by stroking their heads.

He expressed concern that the EC is showing undue leniency toward a particular group and warned that the upcoming election appears to be heading in the same direction as the previous three controversial elections. He made these remarks at a press conference held on Saturday night at the NCP’s central office in Banglamotor, Dhaka. Asif Mahmud said: “Tomorrow (Sunday) is a ‘red line’ for the Election Commission. If, on the final day of appeal hearings, the Commission allows any loan defaulters or individuals holding dual citizenship to contest the election, we will take to the streets and initiate legal action. We will not allow the EC to conduct another negligent and compromise-driven election like the previous three.” He further alleged that several individuals, despite holding dual citizenship, are attempting to exert influence by approaching the Election Commission, which he described as a grave threat to democracy. He categorically asserted that no foreign citizen would be allowed to participate in Bangladesh’s elections. At the press conference, Asif Mahmud also criticized the role of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), saying: \"Although the BNP claims to be a custodian of democracy, in reality they are working against it.” He warned that the NCP would take action against the Election Commission if it committed any mistakes or demonstrated bias. NCP Joint Member Secretary Zahidul Islam Musa alleged that many BNP candidates are loan defaulters, yet returning officers have declared their nominations valid in a biased manner.

Under Rule 18 of the Political Parties and Candidates’ Code of Conduct, 2025, no candidate is permitted to begin campaigning earlier than three weeks prior to the scheduled polling date. As a result, the online activities were deemed a clear violation of the code of conduct. Hasan Zafir Tuhin has been directed to appear in person at the office of the Election Investigation and Judicial Committee at 10:30am on Tuesday and submit a written explanation as to why legal action should not be taken against him.

He made the remarks while speaking at an exchange meeting with families of those killed and injured in the July uprising at the Krishibid Institution Bangladesh (KIB) in the capital. “The movement was, in the truest sense, a mass uprising of pro-democracy people,” Tarique said. “1971 was about achieving independence, while the 2024 movement was about protecting that independence and sovereignty.” He said the independence achieved in 1971 was safeguarded through the 2024 movement and added that July fighters should therefore be recognized as freedom fighters. Tarique Rahman further said that if BNP comes to power with public support, a separate department would be formed under the Ministry of Liberation War Affairs to look after the families of those killed and injured in the July uprising. “The state cannot bring back those we have lost,” he said, adding that it has a responsibility to care for the bereaved families and ensure proper treatment and rehabilitation for the injured.

{"title": "BNP urges Election Commission to act neutrally", "body": "Chhatra Dal said it will again lay siege to the EC office on Monday and continue the program until its demands are met BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has urged the Election Commission (EC) to carry out its duties in a neutral manner. He made the remarks on Sunday evening after a meeting with Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) AMM Nasir Uddin at the Election Commission building in Agargaon, Dhaka. Meanwhile, Chhatra Dal staged a day-long sit-in in front of the EC building in Agargaon, pressing three demands. Party leaders and activists began their pre-announced “siege of the Election Commission office” program at around 11am on Sunday, taking position in front of the EC complex. Later in the evening, following a meeting with EC Senior Secretary Akhtar Hossain, the program was suspended for the day, with an announcement that the sit-in would resume on Monday. Leaders and activists of Chhatra Dal from various units, including the central committee, Dhaka University, Jagannath University, Dhaka Metropolitan North and South, and different thanas of the capital, participated in the program. More than a thousand activists joined the demonstration in front of the EC headquarters. Chhatra Dal President Rakibul Islam Rakib told journalists: “We had a fruitful discussion with the election commissioners. The commission has assured us that our demands are reasonable and that steps will be taken to address them.” He added: “We are suspending today’s program for now. However, from 11am on Monday, we will again carry out the siege of the Election Commission. The program will continue until our demands are met.” During the siege program, at around 5pm, a four-member BNP delegation led by Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir held a meeting with the CEC. The delegation included BNP Standing Committee member and Election Steering Committee Chairman Nazrul Islam Khan, BNP Chairperson’s Advisory Council member Ismail Zabiullah, and former acting Election Commission secretary Dr Mohammad Zakaria. Speaking to journalists after the meeting, Mirza Fakhrul said: “BNP has always been cooperating with the Election Commission to ensure a free, fair and neutral election. Unfortunately, we have observed certain issues where biased measures are being taken and some partial behaviour is evident. We have urged the commission to abandon these practices and act in a completely neutral manner.” Highlighting issues discussed in the meeting, he said the postal ballot issue remains unresolved. “We believe the way ballot papers for registered voters living abroad have been printed is not correct. It appears that an attempt has been made to give undue advantage to a particular party. We have called for these ballot papers to be changed,” he added. Raising allegations of violations of the electoral code of conduct and unlawful collection of personal information, Mirza Fakhrul said: “Jamaat activists are going door to door collecting copies of voters’ NID cards, bKash numbers and mobile phone numbers. This is not only a violation of personal privacy but also a criminal offence. We have urged the commission to take immediate action on this issue.” He further alleged that a political party is using unethical tactics to relocate voters from different parts of the country to Dhaka. “We have requested the commission to urgently provide us with a detailed list specifying from which areas, how many voters, for what reasons and on what dates they have been relocated to Dhaka,” he said. The BNP secretary general also alleged that in various constituencies, some officials - including returning officers, assistant returning officers, superintendents of police and officers-in-charge (OCs) - are “shamelessly working in favour of a particular party.” He said BNP has requested their withdrawal, subject to investigation, in the interest of holding a free, fair and credible election Responding to a question about Chhatra Dal’s movement in front of the EC, Mirza Fakhrul said: “The commission has allowed the resumption of a university election that had previously been suspended. The Election Commission should reconsider this decision. Otherwise, it will remain questionable.”", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/401296/bnp-urges-election-commission-to-act-neutrally", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 655}

{"title": "Experts: Reducing raw material use via circular practices benefits industries", "body": "The workshop was organized by international business consultancy firm LightCastle Partners, with support from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Bangladesh Waste should not be viewed as a problem but rather as a resource. Particularly in the garment industry, reducing the use of raw materials and reusing production waste can create new opportunities and business prospects. When companies are able to manufacture products using fewer inputs, production costs naturally decrease. At the same time, if waste generated during the production process can be transformed into new products or raw materials, it can also become an additional source of income. The observations were made at a workshop, which was organized to further promote the concept of the circular economy among businesses and to showcase practical transformative approaches. The three-day workshop called ‘CIRCO Track’ concluded at a hotel in Gulshan, Dhaka on Wednesday. It was conducted following the CIRCO methodology by Pieter van Os, co-founder of CIRCO International, and Nattinee Dora Sae-Ho, trainer at CIRCO Hub Thailand, among others. In the workshop, participants developed outlines of innovative business models based on circularity principles. The workshop was organized by international business consultancy firm LightCastle Partners, with support from the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Bangladesh. For Bangladesh to sustain the growth of its garment sector and other industries, and remain competitive in the global market, there is no alternative to this approach. This has become even more critical in the context of Bangladesh’s impending graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status in November 2026. In practice, the readymade garment industry is already producing mattresses and pillows using cut waste (“Jhut”), while yarn is now being manufactured from discarded plastic bottles. These initiatives not only ensure business profitability but also significantly reduce waste, generating positive outcomes for both the economy and the environment. The initiative was also supported by Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO) and CIRCO Netherlands. The three-day program was formally inaugurated on 11 January by Mohammed Sohel, director of BGMEA. The closing remarks were delivered by Tanzila Tajreen, senior policy advisor for private sector development, economic affairs from the Dutch Embassy in Bangladesh. It was stated at the workshop that in response to global economic challenges, the European Union (EU) is steadily advancing toward environmentally sustainable production. Ensuring environmental protection at every stage of the production process remains a major challenge for Bangladesh and other developing countries. Speakers and trainers noted that in an increasingly competitive market, global buyers are shifting toward the use of recycled materials by 2030. In this context, CIRCO Hub Bangladesh will play a vital supporting role in helping Bangladeshi manufacturers meet sustainability standards. Organizers reported that officials from 10 companies in the garment and textile sector participated in the workshop. The participants included representatives from garment and recycling sector SMEs, leading manufacturers, and BGMEA. Over the coming months, the Bangladesh Hub will train a total of 60 participants, two officials from 30 companies. Participants will be developed as “Circularity Ambassadors” and will help build a strong local ecosystem for innovation and policy advocacy. CIRCO Hub Bangladesh is a strategic platform designed to guide small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in the ready-made garment and textile sectors, toward environmentally friendly circular production practices. Based on the academic framework of Delft University of Technology, the methodology is internationally recognized for developing distinctive circular business models. Under this platform, more than 2,500 companies worldwide have already been trained. To make circularity more feasible, open, and widely adoptable, CIRCO Hub Bangladesh recently organized a roundtable discussion with leading garment industry’s circularity experts; and currently working to develop circularity specialists at the local level.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/401218/experts-reducing-raw-material-use-via-circular", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 607}

For this purpose, it was launched from Sunday after completing the effective connection process of NBR's e-return system with Asycuda World. As a result, the long-standing suffering of taxpayers in getting credit against advance income tax payment at the import stage has come to an end. At the same time, the e-return filing process has become easier and more transparent for importer traders. According to the NBR, while entering business income information in the e-return, the importer taxpayer will automatically see all the information on advance income tax paid against each bill of entry in the relevant income year. This income tax paid at the import stage will be automatically adjusted from the total income tax payable in the e-return system to calculate the final amount payable in the return. Meanwhile, since the launch of the online e-return filing program for the 2025-26 tax year on the website www.etaxnbr.gov.bd by Finance Adviser Dr. Salehuddin Ahmed on August 4, 2025, there has been a huge response. According to NBR data, so far more than 4.6 million taxpayers have registered in the e-return system and about 3.3 million taxpayers have already filed their returns online. It is noteworthy that those for whom e-return filing is not mandatory are also voluntarily filing their returns online. In addition, expatriate Bangladeshi taxpayers are also getting the opportunity to file their returns online by registering in the e-return system in the current tax year. So far, about 4,000 expatriate Bangladeshis have filed their income tax returns for the 2025-26 tax year online. The NBR also said that there is no need to upload any papers or documents for filing e-returns online.

The honor was conferred in recognition of his debut novel “Lenin,” published in 2024—a work that has drawn wide critical and readerly attention for its depth, originality, and philosophical intensity. The novel is a bold literary reimagining of the life and ideas of Vladimir Ilich Lenin, crafted through nearly six years of meticulous research and sustained creative effort.

In 2025, Md Ashanur Rahman further expanded his literary landscape with his first short story collection, “Bhor O Baruder Golpo,” a series of powerful narratives where dawn, conflict, memory, and hope intersect. The stories reveal a deep sensitivity to time and transformation, capturing the silent tensions of lives shaped by violence, resilience, and quiet endurance.

{"title": "IFIC Bank’s roadmap: Built on trust, driven by the future", "body": "IFIC Bank is powered by a dynamic and resourceful workforce, with more than 80% of its employees drawn from the youth segment In a rapidly evolving financial landscape, IFIC Bank is shaping the future of banking in Bangladesh by combining its legacy of trust with forward-looking innovation. The Bank is anchored by the country’s largest banking network, a dynamic youth-driven workforce, and a stable balance sheet with a deposit base of approximately BDT52,000 crore. IFIC Bank is advancing with renewed confidence, supported by strong liquidity, unwavering customer service, and restored depositor trust. With a clear strategic focus on asset quality, countrywide network coverage, corporate governance excellence, and digital transformation, IFIC Bank is building a resilient, transparent, and sustainable institution for the years ahead. IFIC Bank acknowledges concerns regarding its current classified loan ratio and has made loan recovery and asset quality improvement its foremost strategic priorities. In 2025 alone, the Bank recovered BDT 6,006 crore, reflecting measurable progress supported by disciplined execution. With strengthened credit governance and intensified recovery initiatives, IFIC Bank aims to achieve a meaningful reduction in its classified loan ratio in the near term, which is critical to restoring balance sheet strength and supporting sustainable growth. The Bank’s resilience is further demonstrated by its ability to sustain growth despite a surge in negative propaganda and coordinated negative narratives across digital media. During this period, IFIC Bank successfully reinforced depositor confidence, onboarded 289,000 new customers, opened 773,100 new accounts, and achieved total deposit growth of approximately BDT6,200 crore within a year. Alongside improvements in asset quality, IFIC Bank continues to maintain a healthy Advance–Deposit (AD) ratio of 87%, supported by strong and stable liquidity flows. Notably, throughout its entire history, the Bank has never dishonored or refused a customer cheque under any circumstances, underscoring the strength of its liquidity management and the enduring confidence of its depositors. Furthermore, IFIC Bank has not availed any liquidity support from Bangladesh Bank under the incentive support program to date, reinforcing its position as a self-reliant and resilient financial institution. IFIC Bank regards the forensic audit as a key milestone that highlights its strong regulatory discipline and adherence to global best practices. While stakeholder concerns regarding forensic audits are understandable, particularly as such assessments are sometimes perceived as diagnostic \"health checks,\" it is important to note that forensic audits are already well-defined supervisory procedures under the regulatory framework of Bangladesh Bank. Viewing the forensic audit as an opportunity to reinforce its commitment to sound governance, transparency, and regulatory compliance, IFIC Bank believes the process will serve as a credible platform to demonstrate the robustness of its internal controls and operating practices. Over time, this will contribute meaningfully to enhanced accountability and the overall stability of the financial sector. As communicated by Bangladesh Bank, forensic audits will be introduced progressively across the banking sector in Bangladesh in line with practices followed in many international jurisdictions. Ultimately, this initiative strengthens confidence, transparency, and long-term resilience within the financial system. To enhance access to banking services and address customer demand, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas, IFIC Bank has already established a strong and inclusive footprint through the country’s largest banking network, comprising over 1,400 branches and uposhakhas nationwide. Building on this foundation, the Bank is now accelerating the expansion of its ATM network to further improve customer convenience and accessibility. IFIC Bank is actively working to increase the number of its ATM booths to 150+ by the end of 2026, reinforcing its commitment to seamless and round-the-clock banking services across the country. In recent years, both global and domestic economic shifts have created a challenging operating environment for the financial sector. As a first-generation bank, IFIC Bank has navigated nearly five decades of political and economic transitions. The events of July 2024 served as a moment of reflection, particularly in relation to deposit trends and non-performing loan performance and reinforced the Bank’s focus on strengthening operational and balance sheet resilience. Following the reconstitution of the Board in August 2024, Bangladesh Bank appointed a new leadership team comprising experienced professionals from diverse sectors to strengthen governance, strategic oversight, and institutional stability. Despite sector-wide pressures, IFIC Bank has continued to demonstrate resilience through prudent policy measures, ongoing innovation, and robust risk management practices. IFIC Bank is powered by a dynamic and resourceful workforce, with more than 80% of its employees drawn from the youth segment. This vibrant team is shaping tomorrow’s Bangladesh by being professionally goal-oriented, deeply committed to service excellence, and digitally adept. By prioritizing diversity, equity, and inclusion grounded in meritocracy, the Bank has adopted a comprehensive approach to workforce development. Significant reforms have been undertaken across departments and divisions to ensure optimal utilization of employee expertise. To further align the organization, the Bank has organized periodic regional meetings and Town Hall sessions where the Board and Management clarify the corporate vision for employees at all levels. These engagements have successfully increased a sense of belonging and heightened the sense of responsibility throughout the workforce. Beyond policy orientation, IFIC Bank has fostered a strong learning culture where Board Members and Senior Management take part in specialized programs on corporate governance and other critical areas to strengthen leadership engagement. Moreover, as a tangible outcome of these initiatives, the Bank promoted 1,122 employees across different levels during the year, reinforcing a performance-driven culture and a clear pathway for career progression. IFIC Bank remains committed to making banking more accessible and inclusive for everyone. In line with this commitment, the Bank has digitized a wide range of services through its modern and user-centric platform, the IFIC Aamar App. Building on this progress, IFIC Bank recently launched the web version of the app to further expand access and ensure greater convenience for customers across all platforms. A dedicated team of experts is continuously working to enhance the overall experience, with a strong focus on performance, usability, and security. As the Bank moves into 2026, customers can expect the IFIC Aamar App to become even more robust and intuitive. This advancement supports the broader objective of reducing dependency on traditional branch-based banking while enabling a seamless digital experience. IFIC Aamar Bari Home Loan remains one of IFIC’s signature retail products and continues to maintain a leading position in the home loan market in terms of both volume and number of disbursements. Designed for creditworthy individuals across Bangladesh, this comprehensive facility supports the purchase of new or used apartments, construction, renovation or extension, and the mortgage of existing homes, offering a reliable and structured financial solution for achieving home ownership. Despite the complexities of the current financial landscape, IFIC Bank continues to move forward with clarity and determination. The Bank’s journey is defined by a steadfast commitment to its depositors, a relentless pursuit of operational excellence, and a vision to remain at the forefront of digital banking in Bangladesh.

These are not rare or unforeseeable incidents; they are recurring tragedies, and our continued failure to prevent them is nothing short of shameful. Urban buildings continue to rise across Bangladesh, yet basic measures to ensure they meet the code of conduct remain absent in far too many of them. Emergency exits are blocked, alarms and extinguishers are missing, and evacuation plans are either unknown or nonexistent. When a fire breaks out, panic becomes the primary response, too often leading to lives being lost. What makes these deaths especially painful is that they are often preventable. Stronger enforcement of building codes, regular safety inspections, and mandatory installation of fire-fighting equipment could save lives. Yet regulations are too frequently ignored, and accountability in this regard remains weak. After every deadly fire, we see investigations being promised and statements issued, but meaningful reform rarely follows. The cycle of temporary outrage after a tragedy continues, while safety remains a dismissible concern. This is not a lack of capability, but a lack of urgency. Fire safety should not be treated as an optional requirement or a box to be checked only after disaster strikes. It must be a core priority that is enforced consistently and transparently. Residents should know how to respond during emergencies, and authorities must ensure that buildings are equipped to protect those inside them. When lives are lost to negligence, the responsibility inadvertently lies with the system that failed them. Now is the time to show that we as a nation truly value human life.

Our only coral island and among the most treasured natural resources we have, declared an ecologically critical area for decades now, is now at the mercy of reckless tourism. That visitors from all walks of life are breaching restricted zones before dawn, littering beaches with plastic, blasting loudspeakers, and are cooking on nesting grounds for wildlife is, frankly, shameful behaviour. Indeed, to call this leisure would be doing it a disservice. It is vandalism disguised as entertainment. While we can sympathize with enforcers since these violations occur long before morning, nevertheless, we need to see more initiative to protect our natural treasures and this starts with having rules that will not be flouted without consequences all the time. We must also expect better from our public who must abandon this callous recklessness and respect the rules that exist so that we can enjoy the beauty of this island for generations to come. The evidence for conservation is undeniable as well. When tourism was suspended for nine months in 2025, nature rebounded. Conservation works but only if given priority and Saint Martin’s cannot sustain the thousands who descend on it during peak season. Conservation must take precedence over convenience and anything less is complicity in ecological destruction.

Indeed, during the election season in particular, but also at all times, the press must be allowed to perform its duty -- without intimidation, censorship, or undue interference. This responsibility also extends to the owners of these establishments, which is where we wholeheartedly agree with Nurul Kabir, President of the Editors’ Council and Mahfuz Anam, Editor of the Daily Star when they spoke at the first Media Convention held yesterday. Both men rightfully remarked that an attempt to turn the media into a purely business-driven industry would ultimately destroy public trust and democratic values, and that without collective courage and solidarity within the media itself, it was impossible to defend freedom of expression against increasingly difficult challenges. However, ultimately, it is the state that must also create the environment for the media to thrive and hold those in power accountable. In Bangladesh’s history, we have unfortunately repeatedly seen an environment of intimidation and repression when it comes to the media - one that, with the elections and a newly elected government, we must finally begin to turn around.

{"title": "Cricket and politics", "body": "Could the India-Bangladesh fiasco regarding the T20 World Cup have been handled better? Since the fall of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, the relationship between Bangladesh and India has been on a downward slope, initially very hostile but moderating a bit toward a thaw. The thaw is presumably toward Indian interest in a possible change in government after the upcoming elections in Bangladesh. But even in this thaw, despite provocative remarks from an apparently unfriendly media in India prone to pleasing the ruling government there, and occasional incendiary rhetoric from some of Bangladesh’s youth leaders, the relationship appears to be in a see-saw. Hot and cold. This see-saw occurred with the cricket fiasco centring the T20 World Cup. All of this happened not at the behest of either government or hostile conduct of the leaders of either country. This was triggered by Indian Cricket Board’s instruction to Indian Premier League (IPL) to drop Mustafizur Rahman, Bangladesh’s star bowler who was selected after a bid, to play for one IPL team, Kolkata Knight Riders. Reason? There was a demand from the militant wings of India’s ruling party BJP to drop Mustafizur Rahman from IPL teams. Apparently the demand was made in protest against the killing of a minority member in Bangladesh. The demand of these groups obviously turned a blind eye to numerous incidents of violence against minority Muslims and Christians in recent days in India itself. This argument never appealed to the people raging against Mustafizur Rahman, because the rage was against Bangladesh. At least, that is how people outside viewed the Indian Cricket Board decision. Understandably, a deeply anguished Bangladesh Cricket Board took the decision not to play in Indian cities (two) in the upcoming T20 series citing security concerns. They viewed the Indian political groups' rage against Bangladesh as a threat to its players’ security. They wanted the matches moved to another country, Sri Lanka. This decision of course was a serious concern to the International Cricket Council (ICC), the organizer of the T20 World Cup. It asked its security team to assess the threat situation and guide their decision on Bangladesh Cricket Board’s request. Meanwhile, Asif Nazrul, Bangladesh’s sports adviser to the interim government, said in a press conference that a letter from the ICC security team indicated it would be “impossible” for the Bangladesh cricket team to visit India for the T20 World Cup due to security concerns. He asserted this communication showed the situation in India was unsafe for the team. In support of his decision, he cited three risk factors, quoting from an alleged letter from the ICC Security Team. Nazrul said the alleged ICC security letter outlined that three factors that could heighten security risks for the Bangladesh team in India were: 1) Inclusion of pacer Mustafizur Rahman in the squad could raise the threat level. 2) Bangladeshi fans wearing national jerseys in India might increase security vulnerabilities. 3) The proximity of Bangladesh’s national election could further escalate risk. He described these as unreasonable conditions and said expecting Bangladesh to avoid these was “absurd, unrealistic, and unreasonable.” He strongly criticized the situation as making it unsafe to play in India. Nazrul framed the issue not just as security, but as national honour and dignity. He said Bangladesh would “not compromise” on the safety of players, supporters, and journalists, and called for Bangladesh’s matches to be moved to Sri Lanka or another neutral venue if necessary. He also criticized the ICC for not acknowledging the seriousness of the situation as he sees it and suggested that India’s “communal atmosphere” and sustained anti-Bangladesh sentiment made it unsafe to play there. He insisted that no single country should dominate decisions about global cricket. In his haste, and perhaps due to strong emotions, Asif Nazrul did not have time for actual communication from ICC such as whether it was an official letter from the organization or an internal exchange between BCB and ICC on safety concerns for Bangladesh players. It was not a formal letter from ICC nor were the factors cited by Nazrul conditions set out by ICC. BCB later clarified that the communication referenced was an internal exchange between the BCB and the ICC’s security department, not an official directive making such claims. In other words, Asif Nazrul was more driven by emotions than actual facts when he wrongly termed an unofficial exchange between BCB and ICC Security Team as an official letter and blamed the latter for partisanship. The ICC has publicly refuted claims that it flagged specific security risks that would prevent Bangladesh from playing in India, calling some aspects of the reported claims a “complete lie” and reiterated that there has been no change to the tournament itinerary. ICC has denied issuing such security warnings, and the BCB has clarified the communication was internal and not an official security advisory. The accusation and its latter denial from ICC put BCB and Bangladesh in an awkward situation. But the die was already cast. The sentiments in Bangladesh became very strong by the perceived Indian “insult,” first when Mustafiz was dropped from IPL, and then from the statement from Asif Nazrul on the security threats allegedly (but wrongly) communicated by ICC security team to BCB. The combined reaction was Bangladesh authorities firmly refusing to play in Indian cities and seeking a neutral place. Leadership in a country comes from a variety of people and sources, whether in politics, business, or even sports and entertainment. But irrespective of the platform, leaders prove their leadership through utterances that are made carefully, respecting their positions. Leaders or people in authority are responsible for each statement they make. They are not like a populist media which seeks to provoke people with taunting news to spread misinformation or mislead people. A more studied and careful response from the sports adviser, who is also in charge of law in Bangladesh, would have been appropriate. Bilateral relationships depend on trust, respect, and mutual understanding. Mature leaders on both sides of the border understand and appreciate this dictum, despite provocations and inflammatory remarks from people who are not stakeholders in their countries future. The current administration has a few weeks before it hands over to a new government. Hopefully, the new administration will be able to steer the country toward a better relationship with our big neighbour, with whom we have lived for over five decades in both happy and adverse times. John F Kennedy had remarked that Geography has made us neighbors. History has made us friends. Economics has made us partners, and necessity has made us allies.

{"title": "The BNP’s moment of truth", "body": "This is the moment to lead boldly, unite the nation, and restore hope As Bangladesh heads toward the February general election, the stakes are existential. The political terrain is shifting fast, and forces of extremism and authoritarianism are mobilizing with alarming precision. Certain political parties, reinforced by right-wing partners, are deploying aggressive tactics -- propaganda, misinformation, and covert plans for vote manipulation -- that threaten the very pillars of our democracy: Human rights, gender equality, and religious harmony. The question is stark: Will BNP rise to the occasion -- or miss its moment? Millions of disillusioned Awami League voters -- alienated by years of misrule -- are searching for a credible alternative. These citizens are frustrated, voiceless, and yearning for stability. If the BNP acts boldly, these voters can become the decisive force that saves Bangladesh from division and darkness. But boldness requires strategy. The BNP must urgently appoint a chief strategist -- an independent, fearless professional capable of crafting decisive tactics to unify the party’s message, dismantle misinformation, and mobilize every segment of the electorate. Think of India’s Prashant Kishore -- a strategist who challenged norms and delivered results. BNP needs its own version of that. The imperatives Clear policy messaging Voters are not looking for vague promises -- they want clarity, credibility, and a roadmap for change. To win trust, BNP must announce 10 clear commitments, aligned with its 31-Point Agenda and backed by a 100-day reform plan: BNP’s credibility will hinge on whether these commitments are communicated with precision and backed by actionable timelines. Voters are tired of rhetoric; they want reform they can believe in. The clock is ticking BNP cannot afford complacency. Every day of delay strengthens those who seek to divide and dominate.

{"title": "Resisting authoritarianism by exhaustion: Why we must fight Trump’s new travel ban", "body": "Despite affecting far more people than the 2017 ban, Trump’s second ban passed almost without notice Just a week after Donald Trump first took office as president, he signed Executive Order 13769 -- his first travel ban. It halted refugee admissions and suspended entry into the US for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. All of these countries have a Muslim majority. Because of that, and also because Trump had previously said that he intends to ban Muslims from the US, critics referred to the order as a “Muslim ban.” The backlash was immediate and broad, coming from Republicans and Democrats alike, as well as US diplomats, business leaders, universities, faith groups, and international organizations such as the United Nations and Amnesty International. Protests erupted in airports and cities across the US. A friend and I -- both of us immigrants to the US ourselves -- spontaneously drove to the international airport in Houston to express our outrage, along with hundreds of other protesters. I remember I felt hopeful. Surely, even people who didn’t come out to the airport would recoil once they learned what the order was actually doing to real human beings -- for example, to the 78-year-old Iranian grandmother, certainly not a threat to national security, who came to the US with a valid visa to visit her children, as she did every year. She was detained for 27 hours at LAX, denied access to lawyers, and fell ill before finally being allowed to enter the country. Today, nine years later and one year into the second Trump presidency, I’m less hopeful. On the first day of 2026, a proclamation signed by Trump took effect, expanding an earlier travel restriction to 39 countries. Citizens of these countries, as well as holders of travel documents issued by the Palestinian Authority, are generally barred from obtaining visitor, student, exchange, or immigrant visas. Turkmenistan is a partial exception: Its citizens may obtain nonimmigrant visas such as tourist, student, or exchange visas, but immigrant visas remain suspended. Despite affecting far more people than the 2017 ban, this one passed almost without notice: No airport protests, no sustained outrage, and little public awareness that it had happened at all. This is partly because it has become impossible to keep up with the incessant noise coming from the White House, which Trump’s former chief political strategist Steve Bannon has explained is strategic: “The real opposition is the media. And the way to deal with them is to flood the zone with shit.” As the noise about the Nobel Peace Prize, the “War on Christmas,” shower pressure, and wind turbines causing cancer absorbs public attention, Trump advances a steady program of norm breaking and lawlessness. The ongoing extrajudicial killings of people on boats in the Pacific and the Caribbean, the illegal abduction of Nicolás Maduro, the threats against Greenland, the masked federal agents terrorizing communities across the US, the separation of families and disappearances of people to inhumane prisons at home and abroad, and the cuts in foreign aid that have already cost countless lives are just some examples. In normal times, none of these would be partisan issues. But these are not normal times. As understandable and human it is that many of us are worn down by a sustained state of outrage, we must pay attention and cannot allow exhaustion to harden into indifference. Silence is complicity, and complicity is not an option. On a human level, the January 1 travel ban means this. Students who earned admission to US universities and secured funding after years of studying and planning are now barred from enrolling, losing scholarships and life-changing educational opportunities. Students who already started academic programs in the US and traveled home to renew their visas cannot return to finish their degrees. Parents with lawful status in the US are unable to have their children abroad come and join them, leaving families indefinitely separated. Children are prevented from traveling to the US to sit with a dying parent, attend a funeral, or provide end-of-life care. Married couples, fiancés, and partners are forced into separation. Patients who rely on specialized or lifesaving treatment available only in the US are prevented from entering. Professionals and academics are unable to attend conferences. Entrepreneurs and businesspeople are blocked from attending critical meetings or negotiating deals. Entire populations are labeled as dangerous or undesirable, reinforcing discrimination and social exclusion both inside and outside the US. This is not an exhaustive list, but merely a snapshot of the devastating and entirely predictable consequences of Trump’s new travel ban. Like its predecessors, it is not a security measure. It is a choice to inflict harm on ordinary people, and this choice is deliberately cruel. As I’m writing this, the Trump administration has announced a further escalation: The suspension of immigrant visas for 75 countries, a move that primarily affects families by closing the door on reunification. If we meet such policy choices with silence, authoritarianism has already won.

{"title": "When the pitch becomes a powder keg", "body": "International cricket has weathered many storms throughout its history, navigating political tensions, security threats, and diplomatic standoffs. However, the unfolding crisis surrounding Bangladesh’s participation in the 2026 T20 World Cup represents something unprecedented: A situation where the International Cricket Council (ICC) appears to be asking a nation to send its cricketers, officials, journalists, and supporters into an environment that carries substantial risks. So far, the concerns centre on Kolkata, where Bangladesh is scheduled to play three of their group matches. Yet this is not merely about cricket venues or match logistics. Instead, the question has become a crucible where multiple combustible elements converge: A diplomatic freeze between two neighbouring nations, systematic visa restrictions, and the presence of exiled Awami League leaders and activists in Kolkata who harbour openly stated ambitions to destabilize Bangladesh’s current government. If India’s own cricket board, with all its resources and influence, felt unable or unwilling to guarantee the security of Mustafizur Rahman against pressure from BJP politicians who celebrated his removal as “a victory for Hindus across the whole country,” then how could Bangladesh trust that adequate protection would be provided for an entire national team? The answer, articulated clearly by Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul , is that they can’t. His statement that Bangladesh would not play the T20 World Cup 2026 on Indian soil while “compromising the security and dignity of its cricketers, spectators, and journalists” represents not diplomatic posturing but a fundamental assessment of risk that should concern anyone who cares about cricket’s future as a truly international sport. Acknowledging risks while minimizing responsibilities ICC’s security assessment stated that “the assessed risk to Bangladeshi nationals and supporters attending fixtures” in Kolkata would be “moderately high, particularly those wearing team colours and travelling in isolated groups to the stadium.” This is not speculation from Bangladeshi officials. The report further notes that the presence of Mustafizur Rahman “may be problematic if religious extremism becomes kinetically engaged” -- bureaucratic language that translates to a very real possibility of violence. Nevertheless, despite these acknowledged risks, the ICC’s conclusion remains that “the risk associated with Bangladesh’s scheduled fixtures in Kolkata and Mumbai is assessed as low , with no indication of risks that cannot be effectively managed through security planning.” The question that must be asked is: Managed how, exactly? The assessment identifies the threats but offers no concrete roadmap for mitigation beyond generic references to “security planning.” Cricket without supporters is not cricket The diplomatic deadlock between Bangladesh and India since August 2024, has led to systematic visa restrictions that would effectively prevent Bangladeshi supporters from travelling to India for the World Cup matches. Imagine a cricket match where the Bangladesh national team plays against opponents in Kolkata’s iconic Eden Gardens stadium with no Bangladeshi supporter in attendance. The image is jarring because it violates something fundamental about international cricket: The sport thrives on the passionate support of fans who travel across borders, wave flags, sing songs, and create the atmosphere that transforms cricket from a game into a cultural phenomenon. Equally, journalists covering Bangladesh’s World Cup campaign would face uncertain visa prospects. Cricket sponsors who need to attend matches for commercial obligations may be denied entry. Government officials who would normally accompany national teams for diplomatic protocol could be turned away. Additionally, even if some Bangladeshi nationals managed to secure visas, their safety once in India remains questionable. Recent reports indicate that hotels in various Indian cities have refused accommodation to Bangladeshi citizens, citing pretexts. How can a supporter plan to travel to India to enjoy a cricket match when basic accommodation cannot be guaranteed? What makes Kolkata particularly problematic as a venue for Bangladesh’s matches is not merely general political tensions but the specific concentration of exiled Awami League leadership in the city. According to investigative reporting by The Print , approximately 1,300 Awami League leaders, supporters, and affiliated individuals have established themselves in Kolkata, primarily in the New Town area, since Sheikh Hasina's departure from Bangladesh in August 2024. These are not passive refugees seeking shelter but politically active individuals who maintain an organizational structure, hold regular meetings, and explicitly state their goal of returning to power in Bangladesh. The presence includes senior figures such as former Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, who maintains a spacious apartment in New Town where he “entertains regular visitors -- his party colleagues” and travels weekly to Delhi for party meetings and consultations with “high-level functionaries of the Indian establishment.” This is not speculation but documented reporting from credible Indian media outlets. Bangladesh is expected to hold elections on February 12, 2026, just days after the T20 World Cup begins on February 7, 2026. During this sensitive electoral period, the national cricket team would be in a city where political opponents maintain an active, organized presence. While there is no evidence of specific plots against cricketers, the volatile combination of elements creates an environment where security cannot be assured with confidence. Security planning can’t override political reality The ICC’s position essentially asks Bangladesh to trust that “security planning” can overcome deeply rooted political animosity, religious extremism in mainstream politics, diplomatic hostility, and the presence of political opponents actively working to destabilize their government. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of what security means in the context of international cricket. Let’s consider a few practical scenarios that could unfold. Bangladeshi journalists attempting to cover matches might encounter exiled Awami League supporters at restaurants, shopping areas, or transportation hubs in Kolkata. Sports ministry officials accompanying the team could face confrontations from those who view the current Bangladesh government as illegitimate. Cricket sponsors in Kolkata might find themselves navigating an environment where their national identity marks them as targets for harassment. How can security forces prevent all possible confrontations between Bangladeshi cricket fans and hostile elements in a city of millions? How can they guarantee safety for journalists working outside the controlled environment of stadiums? The answer is that they can’t, which is precisely why Bangladesh’s concerns can’t be dismissed as mere diplomatic posturing. When a full ICC member nation presents evidence-backed security concerns, the governing body’s own security assessment can’t be a bureaucratic dismissal or appeals to logistical convenience. The ball is now in the ICC’s court. The governing body faces a choice between upholding the principles of safety and setting a dangerous precedent that security concerns can be dismissed when they conflict with logistical convenience. For Bangladesh, the position is clear: Kolkata, with all its cricketing history and iconic venues, has become a place where the pitch can’t be separated from the powder keg.

{"title": "The tax is too high", "body": "Taxing cheaper methods of gaining an intermediate technology like smartphones is a silly thing to do If people refuse to pay taxes, then we've a useful indication that the tax rate is too high. It's not conclusive proof, this tax strike, but it is still useful information. If people smuggle and then dodge import taxation, then this is useful information that import taxes are too high. That's a useful starting point from which to think about the complaint from the Mobile Phone Industry Owners Association . According to them, at least some 20% of high-end phones sold in the country are smuggled across borders -- or, at best, are part of the “grey” industry (in the jargon, “black” market is illegal things, grey is legal but not paying tax). We can see how this might be true, too, as there's a 43% tax on the import of decent smartphones. This then leads to loss of tax revenue amounting to about Tk10,000 crore. And, well, yes, OK, we can see their point. They are the people obeying the law and then these other people just flaunt that law and make money by not paying taxes. We can see why they'd be upset. On the other hand, we need to think about the existence of the 43% tax in the first place. Is this actually a sensible idea? That 20% of the market simply ignores the very idea itself would indicate that perhaps that tax rate is too high. But if it is, then why do we have it at all? Ah, well, that's because the people who make phones -- OK, high-end smartphones -- in Bangladesh are much more expensive than people outside Bangladesh. The government thinks that making phones here is a good idea so those imports should be heavily taxed therefore. The government is wrong on this. There is no good reason why phones should be made in Bangladesh. Therefore we should not protect -- with these import tariffs -- the companies that try to do that. Now, I admit that I'm an extremist in matters of trade so you could dismiss my views on that basis. But economists desperately insist upon a difference between intermediate goods and final consumption goods. Intermediates are those that are then used to make other things, and the general insistence is that import taxes and duties upon them are a really, really, bad idea. Because if we push up the price of the things we make things from, then we push up the costs of those things being made. And those things being made from the imports might well be worth very much more than either the tax revenue being collected from the imports or whatever might be the value of the domestic production of those intermediate goods. Which is where we are with smartphones. They're the very foundation of “Digital Bangladesh” -- we're not going to do that on personal computers for everyone, this is something that's going to happen on phones. We all also know that the whole country going digital is one of those things that is going to enrich us all. Hugely and vastly enrich us all. So, we want smartphones -- the intermediate good -- to be as cheap as possible. We really want smartphones to be as cheap as possible, they're the tool that will enable us to meet that larger goal of an efficient society all around us. Manufacturing them in Bangladesh, well, if they're cheap then that's great. If they're expensive then we want to buy them from foreigners. Because we want cheap smartphones much more than we want either tax revenue or a few jobs. We also know that Bangladesh-made smartphones are expensive which is why there is a 43% tax upon imports -- if there was no such tax, there would be no domestic production. That people dodge the 43% tax tells us that the tax is too high anyway. But taxing cheaper methods of gaining an intermediate technology like smartphones is a silly thing to do anyway. So, the correct thing to do is abolish the import tax. Not that anyone will but that is what should be done. People dodging taxes is an indication -- it's information. But sometimes the correct answer from consideration of that data is to abolish the tax.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/op-ed/401249/the-tax-is-too-high", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 721}

Sylhet could have stayed in contention for a top-two finish had they won the game. After restricting Rajshahi to 147-8, they looked well placed in the chase, but Ripon's incisive bowling ensured they were limited to 142-9. Ripon struck at the very start of Sylhet's innings, removing Tawfique Khan for 1, and then tightened the screws further by dismissing Afif Hossain for 16. He returned in his second spell to claim the key wicket of Moeen Ali, who had appeared poised to take the game away from Rajshahi. Moeen was eventually dismissed for a brisk 27 off 12 balls, an innings laced with one four and three sixes. His wicket in the penultimate over all but sealed Rajshahi's victory. Opener Parvez Hossain Emon, who played an attacking knock of 41 off 30 balls, hitting two fours and four sixes, kept Sylhet in the match amid the top order batters' clueless batting. However, his efforts were undermined by a lack of intent from the middle order. Earlier, Sylhet bowlers produced a disciplined performance to keep Rajshahi to a modest total after Mehidy Hasan Miraz opted to bowl first. Pacer Shohidul Islam (2-37) and left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed (2-30) shared four wickets to put the brakes on Rajshahi's vaunted batting lineup. England recruit Moeen Ali also chipped in with an economical spell, finishing with 1-16 from four overs. Rajshahi's innings was anchored by senior batters Mushfiqur Rahim and Najmul Hossain Shanto, who added 56 runs for the third wicket after the team slumped to 27-2 inside four overs. Mushfiqur top-scored with a 40 off 30 balls, while Shanto, who had struck a century against Sylhet in the first-leg encounter, made 34 off 21 balls with five fours and a six. The departure of the duo stalled Rajshahi's momentum, and they fell short of the 150-run mark. Shoriful, Mahedi lead Chattogram Noakhali Express’ slim chance to keep their BPL playoffs hope was completely shattered after their five-wicket defeat to Chattogram Royals at Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium on Friday. The victory, however, confirmed Chattogram’s top-two finish at the point table, ensuing that they would play the Qualifier-1. The advantage to play the Qualifier-1 is that a team would get two shots to the BPL final. Shoriful Islam claimed his maiden five-wicket haul before captain Mahedi produced an all-round performance to script the side’s comfortable victory. Shoriful ended with an envious figure of 3.5-1-9-5, one of the most economical bowling efforts by a Bangladeshi bowler while Mahedi grabbed 3-12 to help the side bundle Noakhali Express out for just 126 in 18.5 overs. Chattogram faced a hiccup in their chase but Mahedi played a 36 ball-49 not out to steer the side to the victory in 17 overs, as Chattogram reached 128-5. Noakhali gave them a glimmer of hope, thanks to Ihsanullah who snapped up 2-23 to help the side reduce Chattogram to 29-4. Mahedi showed a steely resolve to get the side back into the contest, firstly sharing a 40-run with Hasan Nawaz who made 11 before adding 59 runs with Asif Ali for the unbeaten sixth wicket stand. Asif Ali was unbeaten on 36. Earlier, Hasan Eisakhill and Soumya Sarkar began on a confident mode after Noakhali were asked to bat first but the breakthrough came from Mahedi who removed Soumya for 23, ending 34 runs partnership in just 3.1 overs. Shoriful got into the groove with the wicket of Eisakhil who made 20 ball-25 before Mahedi ripped through Noakhali middle order with two more wickets that included Hasan Ali (12) and Habibur Rahman Sohan (11). Shoriful then appeared into the stage with sheer venom, cutting through Noakhali like up in surgical fashion. He took the last four wickets in his 11 balls to complete his first five-wicket haul and wrapped up Noakhali before they were able to play full 20 overs.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/401184/ripon-shoriful-star-as-rajshahi-chattogram", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 733}

In a scene reminiscent of recent India-Pakistan encounters, Bangladesh acting captain Jawad Abrar and India captain Ayush Mhatre visibly avoided each other at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. While it remains unclear which team initiated the break in protocol, the two leaders dispensed with the customary sporting gesture before Bangladesh won the toss and elected to field. This incident mirrors the stance taken by India during the Asia Cup in September, where captain Suryakumar Yadav confirmed that his team would not shake hands with Pakistani players due to military conflicts. The breakdown in on-field courtesies comes amid “cold relations” between the two nations and a deepening standoff regarding the upcoming senior Men's T20 World Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) remains firm in its decision not to send the national team to India for the tournament in February, citing severe security risks. Tensions escalated recently after Bangladeshi pacer Mustafizur Rahman was dropped from the IPL due to security threats, a concern reportedly validated by the ICC’s own “Internal Threat Assessment Report”.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/401223/u-19-world-cup-bangladesh-india-captains-avoid", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 233}

The issue was discussed during a meeting between senior BCB officials and ICC representatives at a city hotel in Dhaka on Saturday, where Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament was reviewed. The BCB said it conveyed the Bangladesh government’s concerns regarding the safety of players, support staff, fans, media personnel and other stakeholders should the team travel to India. The renewed appeal comes amid visibly heightened tensions between Bangladesh and India, which have spilled onto the cricket field during the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe on the same day. In Bangladesh’s rain-hit opening match against India, the captains of the two teams notably avoided shaking hands at the toss, reflecting the strained diplomatic climate between the neighbouring countries. Despite the tense moment, the incident did not overshadow the spirit of the game. At the conclusion of the match, players from both sides shook hands with one another, displaying sportsmanship and mutual respect. Bangladesh narrowly lost the contest by 18 runs under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, underscoring a competitive encounter despite the off-field backdrop. In a press release issued, the BCB said: “During the discussions, the Board reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka. The Bangladesh government’s views and concerns on the safety and security of the team, Bangladeshi fans, media and other stakeholders were also shared.” The board described the discussions as constructive, cordial and professional, with all parties engaging openly on the relevant issues. Among other proposals, the BCB raised the possibility of shifting Bangladesh to a different group so that its matches could be played in Sri Lanka with minimal logistical adjustments. “Among other points, the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed,” the release added. The ICC delegation included Gaurav Saxena, General Manager for Events and Corporate Communications, and Andrew Ephgrave, General Manager of the ICC Integrity Unit. Saxena joined the meeting virtually after receiving his visa later than expected, while Ephgrave attended in person. Representing the BCB were President Md Aminul Islam Bulbul, Vice Presidents Md Shakawath Hossain and Faruque Ahmed, Director and Cricket Operations Committee Chairman Nazmul Abedeen, and Chief Executive Officer Nizam Uddin Chowdhury.

The match had earlier drawn attention at the toss when Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India skipper Ayush Mhatre did not shake hands, a moment that briefly sparked discussion on the field. However, any such tension was put to rest at the end of a gripping encounter, as players from both sides warmly acknowledged each other after the final wicket fell, underlining the spirit of the game. Put in to bat first, India were bundled out for 238 in 48.4 overs, largely due to a fiery spell from pacer Al Fahad, who claimed a brilliant five-wicket haul for 38 runs. Fahad struck early, removing Indian captain Mhatre and Vedant Trivedi in consecutive deliveries, and later returned to dismantle the lower order. He was well supported by Iqbal Hossain Emon and Azizul Hakim, who picked up two wickets each. India’s innings was steadied by Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, whose aggressive 72 off 67 balls kept the scoreboard moving, and wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu, who top-scored with a composed 80 off 112 deliveries to push India past the 200-run mark. Rain interruptions then changed the complexion of the chase, revising Bangladesh’s target to 165 from 29 overs. The Bangladeshi batters responded with intent, as Rifat Beg struck a fluent 37 and captain Azizul Hakim anchored the innings with a determined 51. At one stage, Bangladesh appeared to be keeping pace with both the required rate and the DLS par score. The momentum shifted dramatically, however, with the introduction of off-spinner Vihaan Malhotra. The eventual Player of the Match produced a match-winning all-round performance, taking 4 for 14 and holding two superb catches, including a sensational diving effort in the deep to dismiss Iqbal Hossain Emon and seal the game. Bangladesh were bowled out for 146 in 28.3 overs, falling 18 runs short.

After losing the toss and being asked to bat first, skipper Nigar Sultana Joty’s side produced a disciplined batting display to post a competitive 158 for five in their allotted 20 overs. Promoted to No. 3, Sharmin Akhter played a key role in anchoring the innings, scoring a classy 63 off 39 balls. Her knock, marked by composure and timely boundaries, laid the foundation for Bangladesh’s strong total. The innings was further supported by Sobhana Mostary, who contributed a steady 32 off 29 deliveries, while Shorna Akter provided late impetus with an unbeaten 16 from 12 balls. The openers also ensured a positive start, as Dilara Akter struck 17 off just eight balls and Juairiya Ferdous added 17 from 23 balls.

The victory kept Rangpur firmly in contention for a top-two finish on the points table. A defeat for Chattogram Royals against Dhaka Capitals later tonight would pave Rangpur's way into the top two. Batting first, Noakhali leaned heavily on a superb knock from Hassan Eisakhil, the son of Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammad Nabi. Eisakhil hammered an unbeaten 107 off 72 balls, laced with four fours and 11 sixes, to propel his side to a respectable 173-2. But Hridoy helped Rangpur gun down the target in 19.4 overs, smashing a 109 off 63, which included 15 fours and two sixes. Noakhali's innings revolved entirely around Eisakhil after Rangpur elected to field. Fellow opener Rahmat Ali (9) and No.3 batter Jaker Anik (3) fell cheaply, leaving Eisakhil to anchor the innings almost single-handedly. Skipper Haider Ali, however, offered valuable support with an unbeaten 42 off 32 balls, hitting three fours and a six. The pair added 137-run for an unbeaten third wicket to lift Noakhali to a competitive total. But in-form Hridoy ensured the chase was anything but difficult. He and Dawid Malan put on 78 runs for the opening stand, in which the former England opener contributed just 15 runs. Hridoy then took complete control of the chase, adding 87 runs with captain Liton Das to bring Rangpur to the brink of victory. Hasan Mahmud eventually dismissed Hridoy to bring an end to his scintillating knock, but the damage had already been done. Liton Das stayed unbeaten on 39 to guide Rangpur for an emphatic victory in 19.4 overs. The defeat marked a disappointing end to Noakhali's maiden BPL campaign, as they finished with just two wins from 10 matches and remained at the bottom of the points table.

According to a report by Pakistan-based media outlet Geo News, government sources in Islamabad confirmed that Pakistan is closely monitoring developments involving the Bangladesh cricket team, which has raised serious reservations about travelling to India due to security concerns. The Bangladesh government has reportedly sought Pakistan’s support on the issue, urging a collective stance to ensure the safety of players, officials and fans. Geo News quoted insiders as saying that Pakistan believes no country should be subjected to pressure or threats in matters of hosting international sporting events. Pakistan has assured Bangladesh of its full support and emphasised that unresolved concerns could impact not only Bangladesh’s participation but also the broader preparations for the tournament. Earlier this month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) publicly expressed its willingness to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches if alternative venues, particularly in Sri Lanka, are not made available. PCB officials told Geo News that Pakistan has formally communicated this offer to the International Cricket Council (ICC), highlighting its readiness and recent experience in successfully hosting major ICC events, including the Champions Trophy 2025 and the ICC Women’s Qualifier. Meanwhile, the ICC has held meetings with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Dhaka to discuss possible solutions, including a potential group swap. However, the proposal has reportedly gained little traction. Cricket Ireland has already dismissed speculation of any group-stage changes, confirming that its matches will remain in Sri Lanka as originally scheduled. Under the current fixture list, Bangladesh are set to play group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai. With Pakistan now signalling that it may also review its participation if Bangladesh’s concerns are ignored, pressure is mounting on the ICC to find an acceptable resolution ahead of the tournament, which runs from 7 February to 8 March.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/401287/pcb-backs-bangladesh-may-rethink-t20-world-cup", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 358}

According to a PTI report, the ICC is coordinating the visa process for around 42 players and officials of Pakistani nationality or descent who are part of various international squads participating in the tournament. Several full-member and associate nations feature players of Pakistani origin. England, for example, include spinners Adil Rashid and Rehan Ahmed and pacer Saqib Mahmood, while the United States have Ali Khan and Shayan Jahangir. The Netherlands squad includes Zulfiqar Saqib, and Canada has staff member Shah Saleem Zafar. Visas for England and Netherlands players, as well as some officials, have already been cleared. The ICC is handling the applications proactively to prevent any last-minute issues, maintaining constant communication with Indian High Commissions across multiple countries. Officials stressed that the aim is to ensure all applications, including remaining players and support personnel, are processed efficiently without unnecessary delays. The move comes after reports that some USA cricketers of Pakistani origin, including Ali Khan, Shayan Jahangir, Mohammad Mohsin, and Ehsan Adil, were awaiting visa clearance, prompting concerns on social media.

Sorry Tottenham slipped to defeat against relegation-threatened West Ham, further increasing the pressure on beleaguered boss Thomas Frank, while Liverpool were held to a 1-1 draw by lowly Burnley. Carrick's first game of his second temporary spell in charge of the Red Devils could barely have gone better in a dominant 2-0 win at Old Trafford. The former United midfielder was appointed as head coach until the end of the campaign following the sacking of Ruben Amorim earlier this month. The 44-year-old, who was also briefly United's caretaker boss in 2021, said ahead of his first game that there was still \"magic\" at United, and his team put on a memorable show. Second-half goals from Bryan Mbeumo and Patrick Dorgu capped an energetic and incisive display by United, who could have won by a far more comfortable margin. \"Great start. No getting away from that,\" said Carrick. \"The boys were fantastic.\" \"Consistency is the key to any success,\" he added. \"If you could find that, then you're onto a winner.\" Guardiola admitted that his team -- winless in four league games this year -- were outplayed by Carrick's inspired United. \"The better team won,\" said the City boss. \"We weren't at the level required to win this game.\" Arsenal are seven points clear at the top despite being held to a 0-0 draw for the second league game in a row at Nottingham Forest. A frustrated Arteta, chasing a first Premier League title for the Gunners since 2004, felt that his side should have been awarded a penalty, believing Ola Aina had handled the ball. \"We created four big, big, big chances and a clear penalty, but we weren't able to win the game,\" said the Spaniard. \"I've just seen the replays.

Spurs crisis The mood at Tottenham darkened further after Spurs slipped to a 2-1 defeat against West Ham, who had not won a Premier League match since early November. Spurs fans turned on Frank and chanted \"you're getting sacked in the morning\" after Callum Wilson struck a stoppage-time winner. Spurs, 14th in the table, have won just two home league games this season, leaving Frank, in his first campaign in charge, under enormous pressure. \"It's tough to take, it hurts a lot,\" the Spurs boss told Sky Sports. \"The boys put everything in, and that's a sign of a squad that is fighting, doing everything they can to try and win.\" Nuno Espirito Santo's West Ham finished the day five points behind Forest, who are just above the relegation zone. Defending champions Liverpool are now unbeaten in 12 games in all competitions but dropped two valuable points against struggling Burnley at Anfield. Germany midfielder Florian Wirtz scored his third league goal since his arrival but the visitors drew level in the 65th minute when Marcus Edwards placed his shot beyond the reach of Alisson Becker. \"It feels like a defeat,\" said Wirtz. \"When we had so many shots and so many on target, I think we had to score more goals. \"But some days are like this -- you try everything but in the end it doesn't go in the goal.\" Chelsea boss Liam Rosenior, who replaced the departed Enzo Maresca earlier this month, watched as his side saw off high-flying London rivals Brentford 2-0.

The match kicks off at 1900 GMT at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where almost all of the crowd of 69,000 will be backing a Morocco side captained by African player of the year Achraf Hakimi. The first AFCON ever to start in one year and end in another could be the second in a row to be won by the host nation, with the Atlas Lions aiming to follow in the footsteps of Ivory Coast, crowned champions in front of their own fans in Abidjan in 2024. Walid Regragui's Morocco have established themselves in recent years as Africa's pre-eminent national team, becoming the first from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final, in 2022, and climbing to 11th place in the world rankings, just above Italy However, they have long been AFCON underachievers, with their only title to date coming in 1976. This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia with Regragui part of the team. Senegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mane scored the decisive penalty in a shoot-out win over Egypt in Yaounde. \"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it,\" Regragui told reporters in the Moroccan capital on Saturday. He has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would perhaps not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not at least taken the team this far. \"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final,\" he added. \"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow (Sunday) we want to try to make history.\" He added: \"Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable.\" Morocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking inspiration of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, as well as a defence which has conceded only once -- and that a penalty in a group-stage draw with Mali. - Security concerns - Being at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game. The Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers for the duration of the tournament before arriving in Rabat by train on Friday. The Senegalese Football Federation complained in a statement about \"serious concerns\" including a \"lack of adequate security\" for the team's arrival \"which put the players and staff at risk\". It also complained about the hotel offered to the delegation, the fact that they were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for their supporters for the final, and about being offered a training pitch at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Sale. \"What happened was not normal,\" said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw. \"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger. \"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries.\" Senegal's star player Mane, a two-time winner of the African player of the year prize, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance. Remarkably, Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have no choice but to rethink that decision. \"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree,\" said Thiaw. \"We would like to keep him for as long as possible,\" added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/football/401270/hosts-morocco-ready-for-battle-with-mane-s-senegal", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 707}

Khoi Khoi capped her remarkable run by winning the women’s senior singles title for the first time, defeating 2023 champion Sadia Rahman in straight sets in the final. She dominated the contest 3-0 to secure the gold and complete an unprecedented medal haul. The BKSP paddler had earlier swept the junior section, winning gold in singles, doubles, team and mixed events. She also added the women’s singles and mixed doubles titles in the senior category, while finishing on the podium in the remaining two events to maintain a 100 percent medal-winning record throughout the championship. “I lost to her (Sadia) in the quarterfinal of the 2023 edition, so I was worried this time as well,” Khoi Khoi said after the final. “Winning the doubles increased my confidence. I will try to keep it up.” Her outstanding performance powered BKSP to overall supremacy, as the institution claimed nine of the 14 titles on offer across senior and junior events. Khoi Khoi credited regular and structured training for BKSP’s success in their first appearance at the national championships. However, she admitted that the demanding schedule proved challenging, with a total of 830 matches played during the meet. “In the last three to four days, we had to play five to six games a day. Even today (Friday), I had to play five matches,” she said. In the men’s section, Muhtasin Ahmed Ridoy of Bangladesh Army reclaimed the singles crown he had lost to Ramhim Lion Bawm last year, beating the same opponent 3-1 in the final. The victory marked Ridoy’s third national singles title, following his earlier triumphs in 2018 and 2020. Ridoy also voiced concerns over the congested schedule, echoing Khoi Khoi’s sentiments and urging the federation to be “a bit more organised” in managing match fixtures in future editions.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/other-sports/401189/khoi-khoi-marma-sweeps-six-gold-at-national-tt", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 350}

The 38-year-old is about to embark on his 21st Australian Open and remains among the top contenders, behind defending champion Jannik Sinner and top-ranked Carlos Alcaraz. Melbourne Park is his favourite hunting ground, claiming 10 titles. Despite scaling back his tournament appearances in recent years the Serbian great remains confident he can still compete with the best and is not ready to leave the sport behind. \"I'm still living my dream to be honest,\" the former world number one said on the eve of the opening Grand Slam of the year. \"It's passion and love for the game. It's the interaction with people. It's the energy that you feel when you walk out on the court. \"That adrenaline rush, it's almost like a drug. \"I think that a lot of the top athletes from different sports can relate to that. I have been at least hearing them speak about that. \"It's so addictive, you know, the feeling of competing.\" His long-time rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal have both hung up their racquets and Djokovic said he constantly got asked about when he would join them. \"I have been asked a lot about obviously when is the end date going to come for me, but I don't want to talk or think about it yet because I'm here, I'm competing,\" he said. \"When that arrives and kind of becomes ripe in my head, I'll share it with you, and then we can all discuss on the farewell tour. \"But right now I'm still number four in the world, still competing at the highest level, and I feel like there is no need to draw the attention to that discussion.\"", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/tennis/401199/djokovic-i-m-still-living-my-dream", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 317}
{"title": "Australian Open: Alcaraz 'hungry' for glory, Sabalenka focused", "body": "The first major of the year gets under way as a 15-day event for the third time running Carlos Alcaraz launches his bid for a career Grand Slam on Sunday \"hungry\" for an elusive Australian Open title, while Aryna Sabalenka is laser-focused on clinching a third Melbourne crown. The first major of the year gets under way as a 15-day event for the third time running, aimed at cutting down on late-night finishes. Top seed Alcaraz is desperate to win it, having failed to go past the quarter-finals in four previous trips to Australia. The title is the only one missing from his major collection, which currently consists of two French Opens, two US Opens and two Wimbledons. \"This is my main goal for this year,\" Alcaraz, who gets under way in the night match on Rod Laver Arena against home player Adam Walton, said. \"I'm just hungry for the title, hungry to do a really good result here.\" He has met the 79th-ranked Walton once before, at Queen's in London last year, when he won 6-4, 7-6 (7/4). Should the 22-year-old complete the career Slam he would join an exclusive club as just the sixth man to win all four major titles after Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Rod Laver. He would also become the youngest, surpassing Nadal, who was 24 at the time. But he has a big roadblock in front of him, with Italy's Jannik Sinner the two-time defending champion and in peak physical condition. Sinner, who beat Alexander Zverev in last year's final and went on to win Wimbledon, opens against France's Hugo Gaston, who he has met twice before but not since 2021. \"We worked a lot physically,\" Sinner said of his pre-season. \"The physical part now is so, so important because the matches can get very long and also very intense. \"You have to be at the top physical level as long as you can.\" Assuming he gets that far, Sinner could meet 10-time champion Djokovic in the semi-finals before a potential clash with Alcaraz for the title. Djokovic would surpass Margaret Court as the outright Slam leader on 25 titles should he turn back the clock and upstage his younger rivals. He has a tricky opener against Spain's Pedro Martinez. Zverev, in the same half of the draw as Alcaraz, is also in action Sunday against Canadian Gabriel Diallo. World number 10 Alexander Bublik takes on American Jenson Brooksby. - Sabalenka hot favourite - Top-ranked Sabalenka kicks off against French wildcard Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah, preceding Alcaraz onto Rod Laver Arena. The Belarusian went into last year's final aiming to become the first woman since Martina Hingis to win three consecutive Australian Opens. But she was stunned by Madison Keys, a setback she admitted \"took me a little time to recover\" from. \"I'm not really focusing on that result last year,\" said Sabalenka, who won the Brisbane title last week. \"But of course I would like to do just a little bit better than I did last year.\" Keys failed to really kick on from clinching a maiden Grand Slam and is in Australia as the ninth seed. She will need to improve after clocking up nearly 50 unforced errors in her early exit at the warm-up Adelaide International. She meets debutant Oleksandra Oliynykova of Ukraine and could face Jessica Pegula in the last 16 and Amanda Anisimova in the last eight. \"I'm really trying to push myself to kind of evolve and add more things to my game,\" said the American. Sabalenka's chief rival, six-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek is, like Alcaraz, angling for a career Grand Slam in Melbourne. \"Obviously it would be a dream come true,\" said the Polish star, who is yet to go beyond the semi-finals. She will begin against Chinese qualifier Yuan Yue.

{"title": "Iran considers ‘gradually’ restoring internet after shutdown", "body": "Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored Saturday morning Iranian authorities have said they are considering “gradually” restoring internet access after imposing a sweeping communications shutdown across the country more than a week ago, local media reported. On Sunday morning, AFP was able to connect to the internet from its Tehran office, though the vast majority of internet providers and mobile internet remain cut. It was not immediately clear why the limited connection was possible. Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored Saturday morning. Late Saturday, the Tasnim news agency reported “the relevant authorities announced that internet access would also be gradually restored”, but gave no further details. Citing an unnamed “informed source”, the agency said local messaging applications “will soon be activated” on Iran’s domestic intranet. The unprecedented communications blackout was imposed as calls proliferated for anti-government demonstrations initially triggered by the country’s economic malaise. For days, text messages and international phone calls -- and at times even local calls -- were cut off. Iran has since been relying on its intranet, which has supported local media websites, ride-hailing apps, delivery service and banking platforms. State television has since Saturday been promoting local messaging applications including Rubika -- which was largely unavailable earlier this week. Even before the blackout, popular applications such as Instagram, Facebook, X, Telegram and YouTube had been blocked in Iran for years, requiring VPN connections to bypass the restrictions. The protests, which began on December 28, have been widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership since the months-long demonstrations that followed the 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini. But the latest demonstrations appear to have subsided in recent days. Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll for the protests, but Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) reported that 3,428 people were verified to have been killed by security forces, while warning the actual toll could be several times higher. Other estimates place the toll at more than 5,000 -- and possibly as high as 20,000, IHR said. The opposition Iran International channel based outside the country has said at least 12,000 people were killed during the protests, citing senior government and security sources. Iran’s judiciary has completely rejected that figure. Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into “riots” that included vandalism of public property. Authorities have blamed foreign influence, namely from Iran’s foes the United States and Israel. On Saturday, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “a few thousand” people had been killed by what he called “agents” of the two countries who instigated the unrest.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/401308/iran-considers-%E2%80%98gradually%E2%80%99-restoring-internet", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 444}
{"title": "Trump threatens tariffs as US lawmakers back Denmark, Greenland", "body": "Donald Trump on Friday warned that he could slap tariffs on countries that do not support his Greenland takeover plans, as US Congress members visited Copenhagen to give their backing for Denmark and its autonomous Arctic island. The bipartisan delegation, on a two-day trip to the Danish capital, said the US president’s long-held territorial ambitions -- strongly rejected by Denmark -- were not shared by the American people. Europeans have also been showing their backing for Greenland, in a military reconnaissance mission that a Danish general said Washington was invited to and which was linked to what Russia does after the war in Ukraine. Trump, again insisting the United States needed mineral-rich Greenland for its “national security,” warned that he “may put a tariff” on countries that oppose that stance. The 11 visiting US lawmakers held talks with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen, as well as Denmark’s foreign and defense ministers, parliamentarians and business leaders. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski said there was “good dialogue” and stressed it was important to “nurture” ties between the United States, Denmark and Greenland. “The vast majority” of Americans do not agree that it is a good idea for the United States to acquire Greenland, she told reporters. “Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset,” she added. The visit follows a meeting in Washington on Wednesday at which Danish representatives said Copenhagen and Washington were in “fundamental disagreement” over Greenland’s future. Democratic Senator Chris Coons said the purpose of the Congress members’ visit was to “listen respectfully to our friends, our trusted allies and partners here in Denmark and from Greenland.” The lawmakers were then to return to the United States “and share those perspectives so that we can lower the temperature and have a more constructive dialogue about the best path forward,” he said. In Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, residents welcomed the show of support. “Congress would never approve of a military action in Greenland. It’s just one idiot speaking,” a 39-year-old union representative told AFP. “If he (Trump) does it, he’ll get impeached or kicked out. If people in Congress want to save their own democracy, they have to step up,” said the union rep, speaking on condition of anonymity. Trump has repeatedly criticized Denmark -- a Nato ally -- for, in his view, not doing enough to ensure Greenland’s security. The US president has pursued that argument, despite strategically located Greenland -- as part of Denmark -- being covered by Nato’s security umbrella. The head of Denmark’s Joint Arctic Command, Major General Soren Andersen, said the United States were invited to the military mission, which he said was “about Russia.” “When the war in Ukraine is over, hopefully with a good result for Ukraine, it is our expectation that Russia will move the resources they have been using in Ukraine on other theatres,... including in the Arctic,” he told AFP. “So, in order to prepare for that, we simply have to step up... train, and that is what we are doing up here.” But Andersen said he had not seen any Russian or Chinese combat ships in the area in the two and a half years he has been commander. Military personnel were more visible in Nuuk on Friday, an AFP journalist said, days after Denmark said it was beefing up its defense on the island. The White House has said Trump’s aim to take over Greenland would not be affected by the European military presence, which French armed forces minister Alice Rufo said was a sign that the continent was prepared to defend sovereignty. Britain, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden have announced the deployment of small numbers of military personnel to prepare for future exercises in the Arctic. Large demonstrations are planned across Denmark and Greenland on Saturday to protest against Trump’s plan. Thousands of people have taken to social networks to say they intend to take part in the protests organized by Greenlandic associations in Nuuk and Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg and Odense.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/401212/trump-threatens-tariffs-as-us-lawmakers-back", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 675}

{"title": "Greenlanders put faith in Europe’s troops and US Congress", "body": "Greenlanders were putting cautious hope in all-out efforts to contain US President Donald Trump’s designs on their Arctic island, as European soldiers arrived in their streets and US lawmakers visited Denmark. In this vast territory that has never fought a war of its own, the 57,000 inhabitants say that, alone, they feel helpless against the leader of a world superpower who insists he will take their home “one way or the other.” “I feel safer,” Marie Sofie Pedersen, a social worker for the city of Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, said after the soldiers from countries including France and Germany arrived. “I hope they won’t stay here forever, but just as long as we’re vulnerable and something could happen,” she told AFP between puffs of her cigarette. A modest number of military personnel were deployed this week by a handful of European countries after Trump said he wants to seize the autonomous Danish territory. Trump has insisted the United States needs strategically-located and mineral-rich Greenland for “national security”, and has criticized Denmark for -- he says -- not doing enough to ensure its security. The Republican has pursued that argument, despite Greenland -- as part of Denmark -- being covered by Nato’s security umbrella. A few dozen advance troops have arrived in Nuuk in the past few days to prepare for their armies’ participation in future Danish exercises in the Arctic. No US soldiers are among them. While the European military presence has been relatively discreet, it has been well-received on the city’s icy streets, where Greenland’s red-and-white flag hangs from many shopfronts and buildings. “We have to stay together in Europe,” a 39-year-old union representative who asked to remain anonymous told AFP. “Otherwise, the Americans will crush us. We are not big enough, but together, we will be.” Greenlandic authorities have informed the population that more Nato troops will be coming to town. “There will be more military flights and ships,” Greenland’s deputy prime minister Mute Egede said on Wednesday. Just hours earlier, talks at the White House between Danish, Greenlandic, and US officials failed to iron out differences between Copenhagen and Nuuk on one side and Washington on the other. Trump’s ambitions appear to have temporarily dampened Greenlanders’ appetite for independence, a goal they have been striving for after three centuries of Danish sovereignty. But now is not the time, Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said this week. “We are now facing a geopolitical crisis,” he said. If Greenland had to choose between remaining part of Denmark or becoming part of the United States, “We choose Denmark,” Nielsen added. According to experts, sending a small European contingent to the island is a matter of “strategic signaling” to the US. But Washington appears unfazed. “I don’t think troops in Europe impact the president’s decision-making process, nor does it impact his goal of the acquisition of Greenland at all,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday. On Friday, a bipartisan US congressional delegation began a visit to Copenhagen to voice support for Denmark and Greenland, during which they were to meet Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart. That provided another source of hope for Greenlanders. “Congress would never approve of a military action in Greenland. It’s just one idiot speaking. If he does it, he’ll get impeached or kicked out,” the 39-year-old union activist said. “If people in Congress want to save their own democracy, they have to step up.” Not everyone sees it that way though. Julio Sandsteen, an unemployed Nuuk resident, supports Trump’s ambitions. “The Americans have protected the island for a long time. The Danes can’t do it,” he said. “Trump wants to have Greenland?

{"title": "Trump expresses appreciation to Iran for halting executions of political detainees", "body": "US President Donald Trump on Friday publicly thanked Iranian authorities for stopping what he said were planned executions of hundreds of political detainees, a rare gesture that appeared to signal a softening of his earlier warnings toward Tehran. Speaking to reporters as he departed the White House for his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump said Iran had called off the execution of more than 800 people. “They canceled the hangings, and I have great respect for that,” he said, reports UNB. Trump echoed the message on social media, claiming that over 800 executions had been scheduled but were no longer going ahead. “Thank you!” he wrote. The remarks followed days of heightened rhetoric in which Trump suggested the United States could take military action if Iran carried out mass executions during widespread protests that have since subsided. His comments on Friday hinted that the likelihood of US military intervention may now be diminishing. While activist groups say the death toll from the protests continues to climb, Trump’s optimistic assessment appeared to contrast with reports of severe repression inside Iran. Still, his statements suggested he was stepping back from earlier suggestions that a US strike was imminent. Trump had earlier promised protesters that “help is on the way,” but when asked Friday whether that remained true, he replied, “We’re going to see.” He also denied that pressure from Arab or Israeli leaders influenced his shift in tone, saying the decision was his own. Trump did not specify who in Iran confirmed that the executions were halted. Meanwhile, demonstrations that began on Dec. 28 over economic hardship and evolved into direct challenges to Iran’s ruling system appear to have ended. Tehran has seen no protests for days, daily life has largely resumed, and authorities have reported no unrest elsewhere, though an internet blackout has continued. The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency said on Friday that at least 2,797 people have been killed during the unrest, with the figure still rising.

{"title": "7.8 million ounces of new gold resources discovered in Saudi Arabia", "body": "Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) has reported the discovery of 7.8 million ounces of additional gold resources across four locations in the Kingdom, strengthening its drive to grow domestic mineral reserves and build a global gold business. The new resources were identified at Mansourah Massarah, Uruq 20/21, Umm As Salam and the newly defined Wadi Al Jaww site. The expansion follows an intensive drilling program that initially outlined more than nine million ounces before standard annual reporting adjustments. Mansourah Massarah delivered the biggest increase, adding three million ounces year-on-year. Uruq 20/21 and Umm As Salam together contributed 1.67 million ounces, while Wadi Al Jaww delivered a maiden resource of 3.08 million ounces. CEO Bob Wilt said the findings validate Maaden’s long-term strategy. “The results leave no doubt that the company’s long-term strategy is working on the ground. This is exactly why we continue to invest heavily in Saudi Arabia’s gold endowment,” he said. He added that the latest discoveries highlight the scale of Maaden’s exploration pipeline. “The addition of more than seven million ounces through drilling across the four areas demonstrates the scale and ongoing potential of Maaden’s gold portfolio, and it continues to deliver as we advance exploration and mine development. Our assets are growing, and that growth directly supports future cash generation.” Maaden’s 2026 exploration program is focused on the Central Arabian Gold Region, where drilling has identified new mineralized zones and possible mine extensions. Work is also underway near the historic Mahd gold site to assess opportunities to extend mine life, reports Gulf News. Wilt said the results also support Maaden’s diversification plans. “The results underline the strength of the company’s broader pipeline. These early copper and nickel results show the same signals we saw first in gold and that the Arabian Shield has real scale to continue developing,” he said. “What we’re seeing at Shayban and Jabal Al Wakil points to a much bigger opportunity across the Kingdom and reinforces our ambition to build a strong multi-commodity portfolio alongside our growing gold business.” Maaden’s flagship Mansourah Massarah project now hosts an estimated 116 million tons grading 2.8 grams of gold per ton, equivalent to a total resource of 10.4 million ounces.

{"title": "Iran enters uneasy calm after deadly anti-regime protests", "body": "Protests in Iran seem to have subsided after weeks of mass unrest drew a bloody clampdown that has reportedly left thousands of people dead. There have been no signs of protests for days in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have not reported any unrest elsewhere in the Middle Eastern country. A week-old internet blackout, however, remains in place. The demonstrations began at the end of December amid growing anger and frustration over Iran’s ailing economy. But they quickly morphed into the largest threat to the Islamic regime’s rule since it took power in a 1979 revolution. The regime cut off the internet and cracked down on the protesters. Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) said 3,428 protesters have been verified to have been killed by security forces, but warns the actual toll could be several times higher. The “brutal” repression has “likely suppressed the protest movement for now,” said the US-based Institute for the Study of War, which has monitored the protest activity. But it added: “The regime’s widespread mobilization of security forces is unsustainable, however, which makes it possible that protests could resume.” US President Donald Trump, who threatened to intervene militarily in support of the protesters, appeared to have backed away from military action. He struck a conciliatory note on Friday, thanking Iran’s leaders for not executing detained protesters. “Iran canceled the hanging of over 800 people,” Trump told reporters while leaving the White House to spend the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, adding that he “greatly respected” the move. It came after the White House said Thursday that “all options remain on the table for the president.” Russia, a close ally of Iran, also held talks to defuse the situation, the Kremlin said. Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke Friday to both Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, describing them as “efforts to facilitate de-escalation.” Moscow had previously kept largely quiet about the protests. Meanwhile, Iran’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi said he was confident the Islamic Republic would fall and called for foreign intervention. Pahlavi, whose father was overthrown by Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution, said he still believes Trump’s promise of assistance. “I believe the president is a man of his word,” Pahlavi told reporters in Washington. “Regardless of whether action is taken or not, we as Iranians have no choice but to carry on the fight.,” he added. “I will return to Iran,” he vowed.

{"title": "New Age | UAP terminates teachers amid protests", "body": "Univ Teachers’ Network denounces removal decision Authorities of the University of Asia Pacific on Sunday terminated two teachers amid protests of its former and current students alleging one’s ‘anti-hijab and ant-niqab’ remarks. The terminated teachers were assistant professor Layeqa Bashir of department of basic sciences and humanities and the department’s head assistant professor ASM Mohsin. A group of UAP students staged demonstrations on its Farmgate campus pressing several demands, including the removal of Layeqa alleging her ‘anti-hijab and ant-niqab’ remarks and removal of Mohsin for allegedly supporting her. Sunday’s termination notice of the teachers said that the decision was taken ‘in view of the prevailing situation resulting from student protests and after careful consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances’. The University Teachers’ Network on Monday issued a statement strongly protesting at and condemning the removal of the two teachers from the university. Contacted, Layeqa told New Age on Monday that a group of former students started defaming and threatening her on a social media platform over her December 10, 2025 Facebook post regarding the murder of a woman and her daughter allegedly by a masked domestic worker. ‘A group of students tagged me as “Islamophobic” and continued cyber bullying against me,’ said Layeqa, adding that the vice-canceler of the university on December 14 verbally asked her to resign. She suspected that an influential section of the university’s higher officials were behind mobilising the students. Mohsin said that he was not fully aware of the allegations against him. UAP pro-vice-chancellor Mohiuddin Ahmed Bhuiyan said that the university authorities took the termination decision in face of student protests. Asked about whether the authorities found any truth regarding students’ allegations, Mohiuddin claimed that a committee which was formed to probe the allegations against Layeqa, verbally informed the authorities that the committee found truth regarding the allegations. The University Teachers’ Network statement said that such terminations would be marked as a severe warning sign against academic freedom in the country. Earlier, Viqarunnisa Noon School and College on August 26, 2025 suspended a teacher following allegations of expelling some students for wearing hijab. Before that in March 2024, a section of Rajshahi University’s Islamic studies students demonstrated, demanding exemplary punishment of an assistant professor for forcing the female students to remove their hijab and uncover their faces.

Mohammed Saiful Islam, superintendent of police (administration and logistics) at the academy, told New Age on Monday that they had only submitted an absence report to the police headquarters, stating that Ehsanullah was no longer attending office. ‘Taking any action is up to the home ministry,’ he said, adding that the academy had no clear information about how or when the DIG left the premises. Academy officials said that AKM Ehsanullah, a 20th Bangladesh Civil Service (police) cadre officer serving as a DIG in charge of the academy’s administration and logistics wing, had remained absent since October 29, when he stopped reporting for duty amid allegations of involvement in extrajudicial killings and other unlawful activities. They said that although Ehsanullah later sent a leave application by post, the academy authorities rejected it. But he was drawing his salaries as usual as no administrative action was taken against him so far, officials alleged. AKM Ehsanullah previously served as superintendent of police in Barishal, where he reportedly faced allegations of involvement in extrajudicial killings and other criminal acts. An investigation into the allegations against him is currently under way at the International Crimes Tribunal. According to academy sources, in the morning of October 29, a police team arrived at the academy to detain DIG Ehsanullah. However, he allegedly learned of the operation in advance and went into hiding before the team reached him. His disappearance from one of the country’s most secured police institutions has since triggered widespread discussion within the police force and raised serious questions about internal accountability. Meanwhile, responding to journalists’ questions regarding how several officers could flee from the Bangladesh Police Academy and whether any action was taken, home adviser retired Lieutenant General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury on Sunday said that the authorities were aware of the issue. ‘I don’t deny that several officers have fled from here. Measures are being taken to trace them and bring them to justice as quickly as possible,’ he said.

{"title": "New Age | ACC to sue ex-JP general secy Ranga for taking bribes", "body": "NOMINATION BUSINESS The Anti-Corruption Commission has found evidence that former state minister Moshiur Rahman Ranga, also formerly a Jatiya Party presidium member, received Tk 1.70 crore bribes for facilitating participation in the 11th Jatiya Sangsad election. The commission on Monday at a meeting decided to file a case against Ranga and former Kurigram-2 lawmaker Panir Uddin Ahmed over the alleged bribery, said its director general (prevention) Md Akhtar Hossain. According to the inquiry report, Ranga accepted the bribe from Panir Uddin Ahmed despite having no business relationship with him, in exchange for gaining him opportunities to contest the 11th parliamentary election held in 2018. The inquiry found that Panir Uddin Ahmed, proprietor of Messrs Jalil Biri Factory and a transport company named Haq Special, bank transferred Tk 20 lakh from his account to Ranga’s account on October 30, 2018. The money was transferred from an account of Haq Special at Islami Bank Bangladesh’s Kurigram branch to Ranga’s account at the bank’s Rangpur branch. In November 2018, Panir Uddin transferred Tk 1.50 crore in four instalments from Sonali Bank’s Kurigram branch to Ranga’s account at the bank’s Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban branch. Panir Uddin paid the money as bribe to former state minister for rural development and cooperatives Ranga, also former secretary general of Jatiya Party, in exchange of nomination, the inquiry report said, adding that attempts were made to conceal the transaction by adopting a roundabout way of transferring the money. The commission also decided to issue a note asking Moshiur Rahman Ranga, also former lawmaker from Rangpur-1 constituency, to submit his wealth statement to the commission over allegations of amassing illegal assets. Moshiur Rahman served as the secretary general of the Jatiya Party, appointed by the party founder HM Ershad in December 2018, but he was later removed from the position by current chairman GM Quader in 2020 and again from all party posts in 2022.

They demanded that the council of advisers must approve the draft of the ordinance at its meeting scheduled for Thursday. According to the demonstrators, students of Dhaka College, Begum Badrunnesa Government Women’s College and Eden Mohila College jointly established a stage in front of the Dhaka College gate, while students of Kabi Nazrul Government College and Government Shaheed Suhrawardy College installed a stage near Bahadur Shah Park in Old Dhaka. Students of Government Bangla College and Government Titumir College established stages beside their respective campuses. Dhaka College student Abdur Rahman told New Age that they decided not to stage street demonstrations creating public suffering as the authorities had informed them about the development regarding the ordinance. ‘We will carry out campaigns from the stages to press home our demand,’ said Abdur Rahman, adding that the interim government must approve the ordinance at its Thursday advisory council meeting and immediately issue it. He also warned that any delay from the government would be met with tougher movement. The Secondary and Higher Education Division on Sunday sent the final draft of the Dhaka Central University Ordinance 2025 to the Cabinet Division after completing all due procedures, expecting its approval soon. The seven government colleges were affiliated to Dhaka University in 2017 before which they were under National University. On January 27, 2025, Dhaka University authorities decided to cancel their affiliation with the seven colleges following a longstanding movement by the tertiary level students of these colleges for a separate university. On March 16, decision was taken to name the new university Dhaka Central University. A section of teachers and students of the seven colleges, however, opposed the structure of the proposed university since the publication of the draft ordinance. Lastly in January 14–15 students of the seven colleges, pressing for the ordinance, blocked major crossings in the capital, causing terrible traffic congestion.

{"title": "New Age | Moves under way to cancel birth certificate obtained by Indian national", "body": "The local administration in Rajshahi has initiated formal proceedings to cancel a birth certificate fraudulently obtained by an Indian national. The Indian national allegedly used the certificate to obtain Bangladeshi citizenship. Smrity Rani Sarker, administrator of Jewpara union parishad and agriculture officer of the Department of Agricultural Extension, has submitted an application to the Rajshahi deputy director (local government), seeking cancellation of the birth certificate issued in the name of the Indian citizen. Earlier, on October 30, 2025, New Age published a report titled ‘Indian man obtains Bangladeshi citizenship using false identity’. According to the report, Saher Ali Sardar, 38, son of Sohrab Sardar of Bantai Dangapara Sani Mandir area in Murshidabad district of West Bengal, India, concealed his identity, married a woman in Dhopapara village under Puthia upazila in Rajshahi, and managed to obtain Bangladeshi documents. He later obtained a Bangladeshi birth registration in March 2020 and a national identity card in July 2022 under the name Md Akash Pramanik. The birth certificate — number 19988118254105789 — was recorded at Jewpura union parishad showing Md Akash Pramanik as the son of Md Ajit Ali and Asma Begum, residents of Dhopapara village under Puthia upazila in Rajshahi. According to his Indian unique identification card (ID number 339991663915), Saher Ali was born on January 1, 1988. However, In Bangladeshi documents, Akash Pramanik’s birth certificate (No 1998811820415762) lists his date of birth as January 15, 1990, and his address as Dhopapara village at Puthia upazila in Rajshahi. Puthia upazila nirbahi officer Liaquat Salman told New Age that following media reports, the district administration formed a probe committee to investigate the allegations, and the committee had recently submitted its report. ‘The committee found the allegations to be true. The Indian citizen falsely identified himself as a member of a local Bangladeshi family and used the forged birth certificate to obtain a Bangladeshi national identity card,’ the UNO said. He added that the probe report, along with an application, had been forwarded to the district administration to cancel the birth certificate that was used to secure the national identity card. Asked about possible legal action against the Indian national, Liaquat Salman said that further steps would be taken as per directives from higher authorities. Rajshahi deputy director (local government) Md Zakiul Islam could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts over phone.

A press release issued by the chief adviser’s press wing said that there were 645 reported incidents of communal violence in 2025, of which 71 were identified as having communal elements. The release, referring to a yearlong review of official police records from January to December 2025, said that 574 of the incidents were assessed as non-communal in nature. Of the 71 incidents identified as having communal elements, one involved murder, 38 involved vandalism of temples, one involved theft at a temple, eight involved arson attacks on temples, and 23 others included threats to break idols, Facebook posts and damage to worship pavilions, the release said. It said that 50 cases were filed in these connections and 50 were arrested, and the police also took 21 other measures. Of the 574 incidents having no communal elements, 51 were neighborhood disputes, 23 land-related disputes, 106 thefts, 26 prior enmity, 172 unnatural deaths, 58 rapes, and 138 others including abduction, intimidation and extortion, the release pointed out. The release said that 154 cases were filed in these connections and 498 people were arrested and the police took other measures in 30 cases. The release said that Bangladesh remained committed to confronting crime with transparency, accuracy, and resolve. The statement cannot be accepted as it is confusing and not true, said Bangladesh Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council general secretary Monindra Kumar Nath. ‘People will not believe such a statement,’ he said. Referring to reports published in newspapers, he said that 114 incidents of temple vandalism were reported and questioned how the government could describe those incidents as ‘having no communal elements’. ‘We have found that 32 women were raped as part of communal violence, but the government’s release shows that 58 rape incidents took place that were not communal,’ he said, questioning the credibility of the report. ‘While every incident is a matter of concern, the data presents a clear and evidence-based picture: the overwhelming majority of cases were criminal in nature rather than communal, underscoring both the complexity of law-and-order challenges and the importance of grounding public discussion in facts rather than fear or misinformation,’ said the CA’s press wing release. ‘In contrast, the majority of incidents affecting minority individuals or properties arose from criminal activity unrelated to religion, including neighborhood disputes, land conflicts, political rivalries, theft, sexual violence, and cases linked to prior personal enmity,’ the release said.

{"title": "New Age | Trump to charge $1b for ‘peace board’ membership", "body": "US president Donald Trump’s government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his ‘Board of Peace’ aimed at resolving conflicts, according to US media reports. The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Hungarian premier Viktor Orban and Canada’s Mark Carney. Member countries — represented on the board by their head of state — would be allowed to join for three years, or longer if they contributed more than $1 billion within the first year, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the sum. ‘Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter’s entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman,’ stated the board’s draft charter obtained by Bloomberg and other media. ‘The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,00,00,00,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter’s entry into force.’ The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter, widely cited by US media, does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory. The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern the war-wracked territory, and a second ‘executive board’ that appears designed to have a more advisory role. ‘The Board of Peace is an international organisation that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict,’ the charter says. The document was sent to dozens of world leaders who were invited to join the board, the Times of Israel reported. It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have ‘the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed.’ Trump has regularly criticised the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organisations and treaties — roughly half affiliated with the UN. Membership of the board would be ‘limited to States invited to participate by the Chairman’, according to the full draft charter published by the Times of Israel. Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-third of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman. The ‘Board of Peace’ began to take shape on Saturday as the leaders of Egypt, Turkey, Argentina and Canada were asked to join. Trump also named his secretary of state Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, and senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff as members. Israel has objected to the line-up of a ‘Gaza executive board’ to operate under the body, which includes Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi.

{"title": "New Age | Iran police chief issues surrender ultimatum over ‘riots’", "body": "Iran’s national police chief said on Monday that people who were ‘deceived’ into joining demonstrations the authorities have deemed ‘riots’ would receive lighter punishment if they turned themselves in within three days. ‘Young people who became unwittingly involved in the riots are considered to be deceived individuals, not enemy soldiers’, and ‘will be treated with leniency by the Islamic republic system’, Ahmad-Reza Radan told state television, adding they had ‘a maximum of three days’ to surrender. Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years. The protests subsided after a violent crackdown rights groups said left thousands dead. Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into ‘riots’ fuelled by Iran’s arch-foes the United States and Israel and aimed at destabilising the Islamic republic. Security officials cited by the Tasnim news agency said late last week around 3,000 people have been arrested in connection to the demonstrations, as rights groups say the number is up to 20,000. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday authorities ‘must break the back of the seditionists’ and said domestic and foreign ‘criminals’ would not be spared punishment. Meanwhile, thousands in the United States staged large demonstrations Sunday denouncing the Iranian government’s deadly crackdown on anti-government protesters in the Islamic Republic. Several thousand people marched in Los Angeles, home to the world’s largest Iranian diaspora, while several hundred others gathered in New York, AFP journalists in both cities reported. US protesters could be seen carrying signs condemning a ‘New Holocaust,’ a ‘genocide in the making,’ and the ‘terror’ of the Iranian government. ‘My heart is heavy and my soul is crushed, I’m at loss for words to describe how angry I am,’ said Perry Faraz at the demonstration in Los Angeles, the second-largest city in the US. The 62-year-old payroll manager, who fled Iran in 2006, learned this week that one of her young cousins had been killed during the overseas rallies held in her native country. ‘He wasn’t even 10 years old, that’s horrible,’ she said. Demonstrations sparked by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests late December in what has been widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in recent years. The rallies subsided after a government crackdown in Iran that rights groups have called a ‘massacre’ carried out by security forces under the cover of a communications blackout that started on January 8. Norway-based Iran Human Rights says it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic Republic’s health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources. The NGO warned that the true toll is likely to be far higher. Media cannot independently confirm the figure and Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll. ‘This mass murdering of the population is terribly upsetting,’ Ali Parvaneh, a 65-year-old lawyer protesting in LA said.

US president Donald Trump’s policies in particular spurred the fortunes of the ultra-rich, which jumped 16.2 per cent in the first year of his second term to $18.3 trillion, the NGO said in a report released each year ahead of the Davos forum. ‘Actions of the Trump presidency including the championing of deregulation and undermining agreements to increase corporate taxation have benefited the richest around the world,’ Oxfam said. The world now has more than 3,000 billionaires for the first time, it added, with the top 12 — led by Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk — having ‘more wealth than the poorest half of humanity, or more than four billion people’. Increasingly this money is buying political power, Oxfam said, pointing in particular to tycoons’ buying newspapers and other media, such as Musk’s takeover of X or the purchase of The Washington Post by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. ‘The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable,’ Oxfam’s executive director Amitabh Behar said. Trump will arrive with one of the biggest US delegations ever for the Davos conference, where he is expected to dominate an agenda officially billed as ‘A Spirit of Dialogue’. Trump’s participation galvanised around 300 protesters who arrived in Davos on Sunday, many wearing masks of Musk or US vice president JD Vance and holding fistfuls of euros. Nathalie Ruoss of the Swiss Young Socialists said the most powerful people in the world make decisions at Davos that impact everyone. ‘And they do it with no democratic legitimacy,’ she said, calling it ‘unacceptable’ that the WEF welcomed ‘fascists like Donald Trump’. For Oxfam, Washington’s decision to exempt US multinationals from an internationally agreed minimum tax rate of 15 per cent was a stark example of ignoring growing inequality. ‘In country after country, the super-rich have not only accumulated more wealth than could ever be spent, but have also used this wealth to secure the political power to shape the rules that define our economies and govern nations,’ it said. ‘Such power gives billionaires a grasp over all our futures, undermining political freedom and eroding the rights of the many.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/europe/288721/surging-wealth-of-billionaires-a-political-threat-oxfam", "date": "2026-01-19T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 431}
{"title": "New Age | Afghan officials meets commerce secy in Dhaka", "body": "A visiting delegation from the commerce and industry ministry of Afghanistan on Monday called on Bangladesh’s commerce secretary Mahbubur Rahman at his secretariat office in the capital Dhaka in a move to boost bilateral trade between the two countries. The Taliban government’s business delegation led by industry and commerce deputy minister Ahmadullah Zahid expressed interest in expanding bilateral trade and exploring specific areas of cooperation, officials said. ‘The Afghan government is willing to enhance bilateral trade with us. We have advised them to raise any trade-related issues through the diplomatic channel and engage with the local businesses to explore specific business opportunities,’ commerce secretary Mahbubur Rahman told New Age. The meeting was held on the sidelines of Afghanistan’s participation in the ongoing Dhaka International Trade Fair at Purbachal, on the outskirts of the capital, according to officials. Mahbubur said that the delegation came to Bangladesh to attend the DITF and expressed its willingness for the meeting. Meanwhile, a non-verified X account named ‘Ministry of Industry and Commerce Afghanistan’ shared a photo of the meeting. The X handle also said that the Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan met with his Bangladeshi counterpart. At the meeting, the Bangladeshi commerce secretary welcomed the Afghan delegation and expressed satisfaction with the expansion of relations between the two countries, said the statement shared on the social media. It also stated that the two sides discussed increasing trade volume through preferential agreements, exporting medicines and textiles to Afghanistan, along with introducing trade attachés in both countries. According to a report published on BBC Dari on Sunday, the Taliban government said that a delegation from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, along with 50 businessmen left for Bangladesh. In September 2025, a seven-member delegation of Bangladeshi religious scholars, led by Mamunul Haque, travelled to Afghanistan at the ‘invitation of the Taliban government,’ according to the BBC report. In December, Afghanistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ director general Noor Ahmad Noor met senior figures, including Mamunul Haque, leader of the Bangladesh Khelafat Majlis, and reportedly visited several madrassahs during his visit to Bangladesh. The Taliban came back to power in Afghanistan as the then Afghan government collapsed amid the withdrawal of forces by the United States and the NATO from the South Asian country in August 2021. Bangladesh like many other countries is yet to recognise the Taliban government although it maintains diplomatic ties.

{"title": "New Age | Train crash kills 39 in Spain", "body": "The Spanish government vowed Monday to conduct a full investigation into the causes of a high-speed train collision that killed at least 39 people, with officials warning the death toll could rise as rescuers worked among the wreckage. The crash late on Sunday is Spain’s deadliest train accident since 2013, when 80 people died after a train veered off a curved section of track outside the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela. The latest happened when a train operated by rail company Iryo travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz in Andalucia. It crossed onto the other track, where it crashed into an oncoming train, which also derailed. ‘This is a day of sorrow for all of Spain, for our entire country,’ prime minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters during a visit to Adamuz as he declared three days of mourning. ‘We will uncover the answer, and once the cause of this tragedy is determined, we will present it with absolute transparency.’ The interior ministry said 39 people died. Over 120 people were injured, with 43 still in hospital, regional emergency services said. Of those, 12 were in intensive care. Heavy machinery was being deployed to lift the most severely damaged train carriages, the head of the regional government of Andalucia, Juan Manuel Moreno, told reporters. ‘Unfortunately, it is quite possible that additional victims will be found beneath the twisted wreckage. The goal is to identify the victims as quickly as possible,’ he added. Unlike the 2013 accident, the derailment occurred on a straight section of track, and the trains were travelling within the speed limit, officials said. Transport minister Oscar Puente said the first train to derail was ‘practically new’ and the section of the track where the disaster happened had been recently renovated, making the accident ‘extremely strange’. Train operator Iryo said the locomotive was built in 2022 and last inspected just three days before the accident. It said it ‘veered onto the adjacent track for still unknown reasons’. The company said around 300 people were on board its service from the Andalusian city of Malaga to the capital, Madrid. Renfe, the operator of the second train travelling to the southern city of Huelva, said it was carrying 184 passengers. Human error has ‘been practically ruled out’, Renfe president Alvaro Fernandez Heredia told Spanish public radio RNE. ‘It must be related to Iryo’s rolling stock or an infrastructure issue,’ he added. The stretch of track where the accident happened had a speed limit of 250 kilometres per hour, Heredia said. One train was travelling at 205 kilometres per hour, and the other 210 kilometres per hour, he added. Spain has Europe’s largest high-speed rail network, with more than 3,000 kilometres of dedicated tracks connecting major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia and Malaga. Survivor Lucas Meriako, who was travelling on the first train that derailed, told La Sexta television that it looked ‘like a horror movie’. ‘We felt a very strong hit from behind and the feeling that the whole train was about to collapse, break there were many injured due to the glass,’ he said. Residents of Adamuz, which is filled with white buildings and streets lined with orange trees, were grappling with the aftermath of the disaster. ‘This is a catastrophe for us,’ Jose Perez Rojas, an 80-year-old pensioner, said, calling it ‘really shocking’. Manuel Munoz, 60, an olive oil factory worker, said locals rushed to the centre of the town as word of the accident spread. ‘We started bringing water, blankets, everything we could. We helped unload vans bringing more supplies,’ he said. French president Emmanuel Macron and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen were among world leaders offering condolences.

{"title": "New Age | Experts for strong city govts to improve civic services", "body": "Urban planners and experts at a dialogue on Monday said that significant improvement in civic services in Dhaka and other cities was possible if an effective and functional local government system could be put in place. The Urban Development Journalists Forum Bangladesh organised the event in cooperation with the Gulshan Society in the capital. Speakers said that city residents were suffering amid a serious lack of essential facilities, including proper waste management, housing, utilities, transport and open spaces. They noted that poor coordination among the service-providing agencies multiplied public suffering, as local governments remained weak and largely ineffective. Bangladesh Institute of Planners general secretary Musleh Uddin Hasan said that in the absence of effective governance, Dhaka and other cities in the country were expanding in a totally unplanned way, causing serious environmental damage. ‘Instead of comfortable urban living, cities have turned into jungles of buildings and cars,’ he said. Speakers also said that children were forced to study under lamps even during daylight hours as houses were dark inside as robust urban planning remained absent. A severe lack of playgrounds and public spaces also are depriving children from opportunities for recreation and social interaction. Vice-chancellor of Manarat International University and environmentalist Abdur Rab expressed concern particularly about Dhaka city becoming increasingly polluted. Gulshan Society president Omar Sadat presented the keynote paper and said that air pollution was causing widespread illnesses, reducing residents’ life expectancy. Speakers urged political parties to clearly reflect their commitments to strengthening local government systems in their election manifestos. Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Abdus Salam said that governmental agencies in Dhaka lacked coordination, which worsened public suffering. ‘Without a strong city government, service-providing agencies cannot work in a coordinated manner,’ he said. He also suggested that Dhaka mayors should come directly under the prime minister instead of the local government ministry. Mayor of Dhaka North City Corporation Mohammad Azaz said that mayors could do little with the limited resources currently available to them. National Citizen Party senior joint convener Ariful Islam Adib said that his party was committed to establishing a city government system. Among others, Ziaur Rahman Foundation executive director Farhad Halim Doner, architect Rafiq Azam, engineer and planner Md Nurullah, Gulshan Society vice-president Syed Almas Kabir and UDJFB president Matin Abdullah also spoke at the event.

She made the remarks while addressing as chief guest at a rally at Pirojpur Government Boys’ High School, promoting the referendum, said a press release. Organised by the Pirojpur district administration, deputy commissioner of Pirozpur Abu Sayeed presided over the programme. Superintendent of police Mohammad Manjur Ahmed Siddique, deputy director of the district information office Parikshit Choudhury and district election officer Md Abdul Mannan, among others, were present at the event. The upcoming election is not only about electing representatives, arrangements have also been made to take the people’s opinions through a referendum on important issues related to state governance, said Farida. Mentioning that four fundamental issues have been presented to the people as a single package, through which they will express their views by agreeing or disagreeing, Farida said that the candidates, who would win the election, go to the parliament, take responsibility for running the state and form the government. ‘They, however, will have no opportunity to work against the July Charter. The July Charter will be the foundation of the future state system,’ she noted. The adviser said that various reform initiatives, including an independent police commission, had already been adopted through ordinances and work on these issues was going on. Farida Akhter, in response to a question about whether the government can speak on the matters after the election schedule is announced, said, ‘The government is not campaigning for or against any candidate or political party. Rather, this is part of the government’s responsibility in accordance with cabinet decisions.’ She said that the interim government was working not only to organise elections, but also to seek public opinion on what the future state system should be like. In regard of the constitutional reform, she said that provisions of the constitution that were anti-people and used to concentrate power had shown the need for change. She, however, emphasised that there was no basis for concern that constitutional reform would undermine fundamental rights or religious freedom.

They formed a human chain on the Paris Road, adjacent to the RU senate building, and submitted a memorandum to vice-chancellor Professor Saleh Hasan Naqib, demanding action against Ammar, general secretary of Rajshahi University Central Students’ Union. On Sunday, Ammar removed the banner installed on Paris Road by professor Mohammad Nesar Uddin, the RU Arabic department professor and Rajshahi district council president, congratulating Tarique Rahman on becoming the BNP chairman. Ammar claimed that Section 55 (2) of the Rajshahi University Act, 1973, prohibits party politics, political campaigns on campus, and the use of teachers’ associations for partisan political activities. Addressing the human chain, the JCD leaders termed Ammar a mental patient who had allegedly been destroying teacher-student relations and the overall academic environment on the campus. JCD RU unit president Sultan Ahmed Rahi said that the university administration was responsible for the removal of the banner and warned of consequences if action was not taken against Ammar within 24 hours. ‘For the sake of maintaining a healthy academic environment, we have so far exercised restraint. We demand that the university administration arrange proper mental treatment for this mentally unstable person within 24 hours,’ he said. Rahi claimed that failure to do so would be taken as evidence that the administration had directly instructed the tearing down of the banner hung to greet Tarique Rahman. Expressing solidarity with the programme, Rajshahi Zia Parishad president and Arabic department professor Mphammad Nesar Uddin said that tearing banners would not weaken nationalist politics. ‘The way Ammar tore the banner has deeply hurt us. We are shocked and heartbroken,’ Nesar Uddin said, demanding strict punishment.

The three-judge tribunal, chaired by Justice Golam Mortuza Mozumder, set the date on December 24, 2025, after concluding the hearing of the first July case of the ICT-1. This will be the second verdict of the reconstituted ICT-1 in the first July case, which accuses former DMP commissioner Habibur Rahman, four senior police officers, and three constables. The seven other accused include former DMP joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakraborty, former Ramna assistant deputy commissioner Shah Alam Md Akhterul Islam, former Ramna assistant commissioner Mohammad Imrul, Shahbagh police station inspector (operations) Ashrad Hossain, and suspended constables Sujan Hossain, Imaz Hossain Imon, and Nasirul Islam. Of them, Ashrad and suspended constables Sujan Hossain, Imaz Hossain Imon, and Nasirul Islam are in jail. The remaining four are still in hiding and were tried in absentia. Although deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and detained former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun were named as conspirators in the Chankharpool killings, they were not included in this case because they are already accused in a separate case over superior command responsibility for the July incidents. On November 17, Hasina and Asaduzzaman were tried in absentia and sentenced to death, while Mamun, who became a state witness, was jailed for five years. According to the charge sheet, senior police officials allegedly ordered, abetted, and facilitated the shootings, while constables carried out the firing that left six protesters dead on August 5, 2024 when Sheikh Hasina fled the country amid student-led mass uprising. The victims of the August 5, 2024 shooting are Shahriar Khan Anas, a class X student who left behind a heartbreaking letter to his mother, Sheikh Mahadi Hasan Zunayed who is also known as Mostakin, Mohammad Yakub, Md Rakib Hawlader, Mohammad Ismail Haque, and Manik Mia, also known as Saharik Chowdhury.

{"title": "New Age | Authors responsible for narrating history: discussion", "body": "Writers, theatre activists and critics on Monday said that although the creative process needs liberty, authors should be responsible for narrating history. They also said that in historical or biography fiction, authors should base their work on the context and use references. They made the remarks at a seminar titled ‘Etihaser Bartaman, Bartamaner Etihas: Prekhit Shaista Kha’r Pori’ at the seminar hall of Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy. Organised by Ayan Prokashan, theatre critic Abu Sayed Tulu presented the keynote paper at the seminar which was chaired by poet and thinker Foyez Alam. Jahangirnagar University professor Masood Imran Mannu, theatre activist Irene Parveen Lopa, senior lecturer of Theatre and Media Studies at Tejgaon College and writer Ismail Hossain, among others, spoke at the event. Abu Sayed Tulu said that the novel narrated the tragic death of Pori Bibi, daughter of Mughal Subahdar of Bengal, Shaista Kha, and also detailed the historical architecture of Lalbagh Fort in the old city of Dhaka while the author portrayed the history of Bengal and Shaista Kha’s tenure as a ruler. Masood Imran Mannu said that in historical fiction, the time frame of the characters and places of the history need to be appropriate for readers and for documentation. ‘The novel titled Shaista Kha’r Pori slips from the history and also historical context,’ said Mannu, adding that many fiction writers including Humayun Ahmed and Sunil Gangopadhyay used footnotes for historical references. Irene Parveen Lopa said that the novel was based on a historical character but created many scenography based on creative fantasy. The novel titled Shaista Kha’r Pori, written by Ismail Hossain, was published in 2016 and Meghdoot Natya Sampraday brought it to the stage, while the stage play was written by Abu Sayed Tulu and directed by Subhasish Datta Tanmoy.

An eight-member delegation of APUB, led by its president Md Sabur Khan and secretary general Ishtiaque Abedin, paid a courtesy call on Bangladesh Nationalist Party chairman Tarique Rahman at his Gulshan office on Sunday. Under the leadership of Khaleda Zia, a landmark policy decision was adopted in the National Parliament in 1992 to establish private universities for the first time in the country — ushering in a transformative era in Bangladesh’s higher education system, they recalled. The APUB leaders said that more than 400,000 students today are pursuing higher education under internationally recognised curricula. This has played a significant role in human resource development, employment generation, and strengthening global connectivity. At the meeting, Tarique Rahman highlighted content creation, freelancing, and online trading facilities as important sources of foreign currency earnings for educated youth, professionals, and entrepreneurs. He also mentioned plans to establish modern hi-tech cities to support and facilitate these activities.

The adviser made the remarks while talking to journalists after visiting the erosion-prone area of the River Teesta along with Chinese ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen at Tepamadhupur Taluk Shahbazpur under Kaunia in the district, said a press release. Rizwana Hasan said, ‘Both Bangladesh and Chinese governments are committed to implementing the Teesta Master Plan. Since the verification process of the project is not completed, it is not possible to start its work right now.’ She said that political parties of the country were also promising to implement the Teesta Master Plan in their manifestos for the upcoming 13th Jatiya Sangsad elections. Noting that it is not that the work will start by January 26 in a hurry, she said, ‘We are giving some time so that the work is done better. But there is no need to spread disappointment about this.’ She mentioned that after receiving the project, they sent it to China with public hearings and opinions of experts at the national level. ‘Now Chinese experts are scrutinising and sorting it.’ So the Chinese ambassador said that they are scrutinising this project very well so that they can complete the work without any mistake as the people of Bangladesh have high expectations for this project. Mentioning that the TMP is a relatively complex project as it includes flood control, river erosion prevention and irrigation activities, she said, ‘Therefore, various issues are being analysed. As a result, China is taking some time to prove its feasibility.’ ‘In addition, China has come forward to build a big hospital,’ she added. The adviser said that political parties have pledged to implement this project. Therefore, disappointment cannot be spread, she said, adding, ‘If an agreement is reached after a study, the money we pay is very difficult to change if more money is needed later.’ Rizwana also emphasised, ‘Achieving a fair share of Teesta river water is an ongoing process. Besides, it is a big political issue.’ So we think that the elected government will come and work to achieve a fair share of water. We have made preparations in the case of the Ganges and the Teesta so that they do not have to wait for the elected government to come, she said. Chinese ambassador Yao Wen said that China had taken a principled decision to implement the Teesta project. ‘It is a big project and it is being scientifically tested.’ Hoping that the elected government will continue to work on the project and maintain its continuity, he also expressed hope for all kinds of cooperation with Bangladesh. Deputy commissioner Mohammad Enamul Ahsan, director of Riverine People Professor Tuhin Wadud and executive engineer of Water Development Board Rabiul Islam, among others, were present. Earlier in the morning, the adviser with the Chinese ambassador and high officials visited the Teesta Road Bridge and Railway Bridge built on the River Teesta at Kaunia. During the visit, Rabiul Islam highlighted the nature and crisis of the Teesta River, which is surrounded by five districts in northern Bangladesh.

{"title": "New Age | Many secondary students yet to get all textbooks", "body": "Many secondary-level students across the country are yet to get all free textbooks for this academic year till Monday. At some places, allegations also surfaced that some primary-level students also did not get all free textbooks. According to the National Curriculum and Textbook Board, about 95.28 per cent of the secondary-level textbooks for the 2026 academic year were distributed till Sunday. Earlier, officials of the chief adviser’s press wing and primary and mass education ministry said that the students of pre-primary to primary level and ethnic minority groups got all textbooks. The press wing on January 1 also said that by January 15 all textbooks would be distributed among the students. The same assurance was given by the board on January 4 in a press release. The government on January 1 started distributing free textbooks for the 2026 academic year among students. This year the board set a target to distribute about 30.02 crore books, including 60.67 lakh for pre-primary, 7.90 crore for Class I-V, 1.85 lakh for ethnic minorities, 6.43 lakh for additional pre-primary (4+), 4.43 crore for Class VI, 4.15 crore for Class VII, 4.02 crore for Class VIII, 5.7 crore for Class IX-X, 3.11 crore for Ibtedayi, and 6,026 for Braille method textbooks. Till Sunday, as per the NCTB, all pre-primary to primary, ibtedayi, and ethnic minority-level books were distributed at the educational institutions. The board statistics show that till Sunday, 97.03 per cent of Class VI, 91.71 per cent of Class VII, 92.21 per cent of Class VIII and 98.7 per cent of Class IX books were distributed at the educational institutions. In the capital Dhaka, some primary-level students alleged that they did not get all free textbooks till Monday. For example, all students of Class IV at the Banasree branch of Ideal School and College did not get Bangla book till Monday. Dhaka district primary education officer Md Nurul Hasan said that they had delivered all books to all primary-level educational institutions registered with the Integrated Primary Education Management Information System under the primary and mass education ministry. They held some books for some schools, which remain out of the system yet, he said, adding that they would deliver all books soon. Bandarban district primary education officer Porinoy Chakma said that only a handful of the primary-level schools were yet to collect their books from the upzila offices. Meanwhile, Dhaka district education officer Md Abdul Mazid said that till now some of the free textbooks of Class VII and VIII were yet to be delivered by the board. Within this month, all books will be distributed, he added. Cox’s Bazar district education officer Md Golam Mostafa said that they were yet to get about 4 per cent of secondary-level books from the board. Although the contract with the printing companies is valid until February 3, the board in a press release on January 4 said that by January 15 all textbooks would be distributed among students. On December 28, 2025, at a programme, the NCTB made all 647 textbooks for Bangla and English versions for the 2026 academic year available online for the first time on its web site: www.nctb.gov.bd before distributing their hardcopies among students. The government has been distributing free textbooks among students since 2010. The board faced heavy criticism earlier in 2025 for delaying the delivery of books to students as late as April, four months after their classes had started. Following the criticism, the board decided to set a target to print about 30.02 crore books by November 2025, but eventually failed to reach the target.

{"title": "New Age | Trump says world ‘not secure’ until US has Greenland", "body": "Donald Trump no longer needs to think ‘purely of peace’ after being snubbed for a Nobel, the US president said in comments published Monday, adding the world will not be safe until Washington controls Greenland. Trump has put the transatlantic alliance to the test with threats to take over Greenland ‘one way or the other’, with European countries closing ranks against Washington’s designs on the vast Danish territory. German and French leaders denounced as ‘blackmail’ weekend threats by Trump to wield new tariffs against countries which oppose his plans for the Arctic island, and said Monday that Europe was preparing trade countermeasures. The European Union said it was holding an emergency summit on Thursday to weigh its response, and that while its priority is to ‘engage not escalate’ it is ready to act if needed. Greenland, for its part, said the tariffs threat does not change its desire to assert its own sovereignty. ‘We will not be pressured,’ Greenlandic prime minister Jens- Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post, adding that the autonomous territory ‘is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions’. But Trump had earlier doubled down, announcing in a message to Norway’s prime minister Jonas Gahr Store that the world ‘is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland’. The message — published Monday and whose authenticity was confirmed to AFP by Store’s office — also saw Trump brush aside peace as a primary goal. ‘I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,’ he said, citing his failure to win the last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, despite openly coveting it. He said although peace would still be ‘predominant,’ he could ‘now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.’ Store said the statement had been received in response to a message from him and Finnish president Alexander Stubb, where they had ‘conveyed our opposition’ to Trump’s tariff threats. Store also underlined that the Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded by the Norwegian government. ‘I have clearly explained, including to president Trump what is well known — the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee,’ he said in a written statement. Trump has repeatedly said his country needs vast, mineral-rich Greenland for ‘national security’, despite the United States already having a base on the island and security agreements with fellow NATO ally Denmark. ‘Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,’ Trump said in his message to the Norwegian premier, doubling down on that sentiment in a post to Truth Social on Monday. Denmark’s defence minister Troels Lund Poulsen said Monday steps had already been taken along with NATO allies to ‘increase military presence and training activity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic’. Lund Poulsen added that he and Greenlandic foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt would be meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte later on Monday. This weekend, Trump said that from February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would be subject to a 10-per cent tariff on all goods sent to the United States — a duty which could go higher. Germany’s vice chancellor Lars Klingbeil slammed the move as blackmail, and said Monday that Europe was preparing countermeasures. French finance minister Roland Lescure, speaking at a press conference alongside Kingbeil, agreed. ‘Blackmail between allies of 250 years, blackmail between friends, is obviously unacceptable,’ Lecurse said. Klingbeil said Europe’s response could have three main strands. First, the current tariff deal with the United States would be put on hold, he said. Second, European tariffs on imports from the United States, currently suspended until early February, could come into force. And thirdly the EU should consider using its toolbox of instruments against ‘economic blackmail’, he added. Europe’s stock markets fell as the week’s trading began Monday, with British prime minister Keir Starmer warning that a ‘trade war is in no one’s interest’. Greenland — whose tiny population of 57,000 has voiced disquiet at Trump’s threats — continued to make its preferences clear Monday. Greenland’s dogsled federation said that the new US special envoy to the Arctic island had been disinvited to its annual race. Jeff Landry had been invited to attend the race by a private Greenlandic tour operator, an invite the KNQK federation has previously called ‘totally inappropriate’.

{"title": "New Age | EC fails to take clear stance on dual citizenship of candidates, says NCP", "body": "NATIONAL ELECTIONS The National Citizen Party on Monday accused the Election Commission of failing to take a clear legal stance about candidates with dual citizenship, claiming that the commission’s recent actions appeared influenced by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Speaking at a briefing after a meeting with chief adviser Muhammad Yunus at the State Guest House Jamuna, NCP convener Nahid Islam said that the EC had not ensured the type of electoral environment necessary for a free and fair vote. He alleged that neither the commission nor the field administration was acting impartially. Nahid said that his party raised concerns during meeting with the chief adviser, warning that they would challenge in court over EC’s decision regarding some candidates with dual citizenship. ‘For the past two days, we have observed that the Election Commission has not taken a clear legal position regarding candidates who have dual citizenship,’ he said. ‘Instead, the EC seems to be trying, through legal loopholes and misinterpretation of the constitution, to allow such candidates to contest elections.’ Such attempts on the EC’s part were influenced by the BNP, Nahid alleged. ‘Pressure from BNP leaders and their student organisations through coordinated campaigns and creating mob in front of the EC have influenced decisions even before formal decision was issued,’ he said. While the interim government and chief adviser Yunus have repeatedly claimed they want to conduct the best election in history and are attempting to gain our trust, the necessary conditions for such an election are not evident on the ground, said the NCP convener. ‘The EC cannot interpret the constitution, only the Supreme Court can. The constitution clearly prohibits dual citizens from contesting elections, and the Supreme Court has clarified what constitutes renunciation of foreign citizenship.’ But the EC issued a new interpretation on Sunday, which it legally could not do, apparently to allow BNP-affiliated dual citizens to participate, he added. Similarly, defaulters on loans should not be allowed to contest before settling their debts but an EC member indicated that despite personal reservations, defaulters are being allowed to run, Nahid further alleged. Regarding show-cause notices issued to NCP leaders, he said ‘We raised concerns with the EC regarding impartiality, but instead of addressing them, the commission issued a show-cause notice against us.’ ‘While BNP leader Tarique Rahman’s posters flooded parts of Dhaka, our lawful electoral campaign materials regarding referendum led to action against us,’ he said. According to a press release issued by the chief adviser’s press wing, during the meeting, NCP leaders shared their observations and various concerns regarding the election.

Home affairs adviser retired Lieutenant General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury disclosed the information on Monday at a press briefing at his secretariat office after a meeting of the advisory committee on the law and order. He said that a2 total of 42,761 polling centres would be set up nationwide, of which 8,780 have been categorised as ‘highly important’, 16,548 as ‘important’ and 17,433 as ‘general’. On a question from reporters, Jahangir clarified that ‘important’ centres refer to those considered risky in terms of security. Of the total 42,761 polling centres, 25,328 centres -- ‘highly important’ 8,780 and ‘important’ 16,548 -- are considered risky, accounting for about 59 per cent of the total polling centres. As per an advisory committee decision, police would use body-worn cameras at the risky polling centres, while closed-circuit television cameras would be installed at all centres across the country to ensure transparency and real-time monitoring. A total of 8,97,117 members of various law enforcement and support agencies will be deployed during the elections and the referendum scheduled for February 12. The deployment will include 1,00,000 Bangladesh Army members, 5,000 from the Navy, 3,730 from the Air Force, 1,49,443 police personnel, 5,76,314 Ansar and Village Defence Party members, 37,453 Border Guard Bangladesh personnel, 3,585 from the Coast Guard, 7,700 from the Rapid Action Battalion while 13,390 Fire Service and Civil Defence will be engaged as support staff. Those who are currently deployed in the first phase, Jahangir said, will remain active also during the second phase while there will be polling centre-based deployment, under which members of law enforcement agencies will perform duties for a total of seven days from February 8 to February 14. A law and order coordination cell will be formed comprising representatives from the police, Ansar-VDP, Armed Forces, BGB, Coast Guard and RAB. A special team under the National Emergency Service Number 999 will have a constant link with the Coordination Cell to receive election-related complaints round the clock and ensure immediate response. Security deployment at polling centres will be determined on the basis of risk assessment in coordination with district- and upazila-level law and order coordination cells. Apart from the police and Ansar-VDP, members of the Armed Forces, BGB, Coast Guard and RAB will be deployed at sensitive and high-risk centres. Jahangir said that election-related training for law enforcement agencies would be completed by today, noting that such dedicated training had been arranged for the first time in the country’s electoral history. During the election, a total of 418 drones will be put in operation by different law enforcement agencies, including 200 by the Army, 100 by the BGB and 50 by the police to monitor risky areas. Dog squads will also be used to enhance security at the vulnerable locations in the election as per the government decision. The ‘Election Security App-2026’, developed by the National Telecommunication Monitoring Centre, would play a crucial role in maintaining the law and order at the risky polling centres. The app will connect the law enforcement agencies, returning and assistant returning officers, and the Central Control Room of the Ministry of Home Affairs to ensure instant receipt and swift resolution of complaints. The Bangladesh Air Force will provide helicopter support to transport ballot boxes, election materials, and officials to remote and hard-to-reach polling centres. Law enforcement agencies have been instructed to swiftly arrest miscreants who may attempt to obstruct the election and take legal action against them. To ensure a neutral and peaceful electoral environment, intensified patrols will be conducted for four days prior to the polling, with coordinated operations in char areas and remote regions. Jahangir also told the reporters that a total of 19,854 people had been arrested until January 17, 2026 as part of the Operation Devil Hunt Phase-2, launched on December 13, 2025. During the operation, 346 firearms, 2,191 rounds of bullet, 722 cartridges, 694 locally made weapons, grenades, mortar shells, gunpowder, firework and bomb-making materials were recovered. Home adviser also said that the government remained firmly committed to hold the election in a free, fair, neutral, peaceful and credible manner and would take strict actions against any attempt to disrupt or influence the electoral process.

{"title": "New Age | EC can hold credible polls, BNP confident", "body": "Party observes Zia’s 90th birth anniv Bangladesh Nationalist Party secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir on Monday said that he was confident that the Election Commission would be able to conduct the forthcoming 13th parliamentary election in a credible manner, commenting that the EC had so far been performing its duties with competence. He made the remarks while speaking to reporters after paying tribute to BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman at his grave in the capital on the occasion of his 90th birth anniversary, where prayers were offered for his peace. The BNP secretary general said that while the party had raised a few concerns with the commission it remained optimistic that the polls would be managed properly. Referring to the current political situation, Fakhrul said that the party had taken a renewed oath to help rebuild the devastated economy and to institutionalise democracy following recent political upheavals. The BNP and its affiliated organisations, he said, are committed to implement the ideals of Ziaur Rahman in the country. BNP leaders and activists on the day placed wreaths at Ziaur Rahman’s grave. The BNP and its affiliated organisations arranged the recitation of Fatiha and special prayers. Senior party leaders present at the graveside of Zia included standing committee members Abdul Moyeen Khan, Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, and Salahuddin Ahmed, while senior joint secretary general Ruhul Kabir Rizvi and the party chair’s adviser Aman Ullah Aman were also present. Fakhrul told reporters that the BNP had renewed its pledge to move forward along the path that would lead to a liberal, democratic Bangladesh. Ziaur Rahman was born on January 19, 1936 in Baghbari of Bogura. He founded the BNP in 1978 after assuming a leading role in national politics. During the War of Independence in 1971, Ziaur Rahman served initially as a sector commander before later commanding the Z-Force as a brigade commander. He was awarded Bir Uttam, the nation’s second-highest gallantry award, for his role in the liberation war. Zia first came to national prominence when he proclaimed Bangladesh’s independence from Pakistan via the Kalurghat radio station in Chattogram on March 27, 1971 following the Pakistan army’s crackdown on unarmed civilians two days earlier. He rose to power on November 7, 1975, in the aftermath of a series of coups and counter-coups, and became president in April 1977. Ziaur Rahman was assassinated by a group of army officers at the Chattogram circuit house on May 30, 1981.

{"title": "New Age | Banks’ dollar holdings drop to $4.2b", "body": "Commercial banks’ holdings of dollars fell to $4.2 billion in November mainly due to the central bank’s aggressive dollar purchases and high import payments. Bangladesh Bank data show that banks’ gross foreign exchange holdings reached to the current level in November, down from $4.38 billion in the same month a year earlier. Although balances recovered slightly from $3.76 billion in October and $3.93 billion in September 2025, they remain well below the level of more than $6 billion recorded in July 2024, indicating a sustained squeeze on banks’ dollar liquidity. Banker said that while remittance inflows and export earnings improved over the past year, banks had to sell a significant volume of dollars to the central bank and use the rest to settle rising import payments. Since July 2025, Bangladesh Bank has purchased more than $3 billion from commercial banks through multiple-price auctions at rates ranging between Tk 121.5 and Tk 122.3 per dollar. The central bank stepped up its intervention after the interbank rate slid to around Tk 119 in June, raising concerns about renewed volatility in the currency market. Officials said that the purchases helped stabilise the exchange rate at around Tk 122 and restored confidence in the formal market, encouraging remittance flows through banks instead of informal channels. Remittance inflows reached a record $30.32 billion in the last financial year, nearly 27 per cent higher than the previous year. In the first half of the current fiscal year, inflows amounted to $16.26 billion, up more than 18 per cent year on year. Monthly receipts have remained above $2 billion since August 2024, providing steady foreign exchange support to the economy. Export earnings also improved on an annual basis. According to the Export Promotion Bureau, exports grew 8.6 per cent to $48.3 billion in FY25. However, earnings in the July–December period of the current fiscal year slipped slightly to $23.99 billion compared with the same period a year earlier, suggesting that external demand remains uneven. At the same time, import activity began to pick up as demand for essential goods increased. Letters of credit worth $69 billion were opened in FY25, up from $66.7 billion a year earlier. LC openings rose to $29.78 billion during July–November 2025 from $27.95 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Bankers said the higher import bill, combined with the central bank’s dollar buying, further reduced banks’ foreign currency balances. Many banks chose to sell dollars to the central bank as private investment demand remained weak and opportunities for overseas payments were limited. Bankers also noted that the narrowing gap between official exchange rates and informal hundi rates reduced incentives to hold dollars, pushing more foreign currency into the banking system. BB officials said the shift from selling to buying dollars has helped rebuild reserves. As of January 15, 2026, foreign exchange reserves stood at $28 billion under IMF calculation standards, while the traditional measure placed reserves at $32.62 billion.

{"title": "New Age | RMG leaders slam ‘one-sided’ yarn import move", "body": "The leaders of the country’s readymade garment sector on Monday alleged that the Ministry of Commerce has made a one-sided (unilateral?) recommendation to withdraw the bond facilities on the import of 10 to 30 counts of yarn. Demanding immediate withdrawal of the move, they also warned that implementing such a one-sided decision would push the RMG industry into a serious crisis. They were speaking at a press conference organised by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association and the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association at a hotel in the capital. Meanwhile, the BGMEA and BKMEA also sent separate letters to the advisers to the commerce ministry, the finance ministry, and the NBR chairman to clarify their stances against the government›s move to withdraw the bond facility. The also demonstrated the possible drawbacks the sector might face if the NBR implement the commerce ministry’s recommendation of withdrawing bond facility on yarn imports from global sources, including India. Under the National Board of Revenue’s bond facility, export-oriented industries are allowed to import raw materials duty-free on the condition that the finished goods are exported. Last week, the commerce ministry urged the NBR to withdraw bonded warehouse facilities for importing 10 to 30 counts of yarn to protect domestic textile mills, following the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association›s request and the Bangladesh Trade and Tariff Commission›s recommendation. The letter said that due to aggressive and supportive policies, Indian traders have been selling the widely used 30-count yarn in Bangladesh at $2.50 to $2.60 a kilogram, even though the production cost of the same yarn in India stands at $2.90 to $2.93 a kilogram, about 30 cents higher than the selling price. Meanwhile, in a statement to the media, Showkat Aziz Russell, president of the Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, said that the stakeholders’ information at the press conference was inaccurate. He said that the commerce ministry discussed with stakeholders from both BTMA, BGMEA, and BKMEA before their application to the BTTC. ‘After the careful verification of the data, the ministry recommended that only yarn of counts 10 to 30 (HS Codes 5205, 5206, 5207) be excluded from bond facility benefits. No proposal was made to impose new duties on these yarns, nor has any safeguard duty been suggested,’ he added. He also said that duty-free imports under the bond facility have not benefited domestic RMG manufacturers; instead, foreign buyers have largely enjoyed these advantages. Meanwhile, local spinning mills, despite investing billions of dollars, struggle to compete due to subsidies offered by neighboring countries, he added. He also said that before making their proposal, multiple formal and informal meetings were held with RMG stakeholders and government officials, and both parties agreed with the proposals. At the press conference, the BGMEA acting president, Selim Rahman, said that although garment exporters are the sole buyers of yarn produced by local spinning mills, the interests of the apparel industry were completely ignored in taking such a sensitive and far-reaching decision. ‘During discussions with the BTTC, our views were sidelined, and the move would directly violate Articles 3 and 4 of the World Trade Organization’s Safeguards Agreement,’ he added. Such an attempt to impose a one-sided decision would be undesirable and highly questionable from a policy perspective,’ he added. Responding a question, he said, in order to protect the domestic textile sector, the government to enhance capacity, productivity, efficiency, and modernise the sector along with direct incentives and uninterrupted energy supply. Imposing duties on yarn imports would negatively affect exports, he added, saying that RMG exports already declined by 2.63 per cent during July–December of FY26, while exports fell sharply by 14.23 per cent in December alone. ‘If exporters are forced to buy higher-priced yarn, buyers would reduce orders, which would also hurt the textile sector as they could have no buyers to buy yarns,’ he added. BKMEA president Mohammad Hatem questioned why the Commerce Ministry and the BTTC failed to investigate the reasons behind rising yarn imports from India, saying the increase was largely due to cuts in cash incentives for local textile millers. ‘If yarn imports are restricted, it would trigger increased fabric imports from China, which are still cheaper than those produced in Bangladesh,’ he added. He also alleged that the Indian government provides various incentives in ways that bypass WTO rules, while Bangladesh is reducing incentives for its own exporters. ‘The government has a responsibility to ensure a win-win situation for all stakeholders,’ he added. Responding to a question, Hatem said that they also want to protect the local textile mills, but through adequate policy support, not by hurting the RMG sector. He also urged the government to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with all stakeholders, along with a comparative analysis by prominent economists and researchers. Responding a question, BKMEA executive president Fazlee Shamim Ehsan said if India sells yarn lower than production costs, government could easily take anti-dumping policy against them through WTO rules. ‘It is strange why the government isn’t taking such measures; rather, they are moving towards banning imports from the world to create a monopoly, which isn’t compliant with fair business,’ he added. Regarding the stocks of huge yarns, he said that the exports of the country are on a downward trend and the government should take policy measures to overcome this, not bind the RMG sector. He also said that the country’s textile millers lack competitiveness or a mentality not to take on challenges, as most competitor countries export yarns, but they can’t. ‘Pakistan, India, Cambodia, all are exporting yarn, but our exporters solely rely on domestic buyers, which is a drawback,’ he added, saying that the country’s textile sector has still been receiving incentives for the past thirty years. Citing ASYCUDA World data, Fazlee Shamim Ehsan said Bangladesh’s yarn imports under bond declined by 8.11 per cent to 345,577.82 tonnes during July–December of FY26 from 376,060.40 tonnes in the same period of the previous fiscal year. Moreover, imports from India also fell by 7.33 per cent year-on-year to 333,854.49 tonnes from 365,563.24 tonnes during the same period. ‘Export-oriented industries worldwide enjoy duty-free access to raw materials. If Bangladesh restricts this facility, buyers would shift orders to other countries to secure competitive prices,’ he added. Responding to another question, Fazlee Shamim Ehsan said that last year, the government imposed a ban on yarn import through land ports, but didn’t disclose the benefit from it yet. India then restricted transshipment and imports through land ports, hampering our RMG and non-RMG exports. We have come to know that the ban on land ports has had little impact on our textile mills,’ he added. In such a situation, moving to another ban would only impact the highest export-earning sector, he added, urging the government to increase policy support for the textile millers. Responding to a question, BGMEA acting president Selim Rahman said they import yarns from many sources, not just India. Responding a question, Fazlee Shamim Ehsan said that the government might have taken decision against RMG sector influenced by a quarter. ‘As it is a non-political government, they have no obligation to hear from the majority. They might have been making decisions by being influenced by a certain quarter,’ he added. Leaders from the BGMEA and BKMEA also spoke at the event.

{"title": "New Age | Govt to sell Nassa Group assets to clear workers’ dues", "body": "The government plans to sell Nassa Group’s assets to pay off outstanding wages and service benefits to the company’s employees, following a court directive, according to the Ministry of Labour and Employment. In a statement issued by the ministry on Monday, adviser M Sakhawat Hussain confirmed the decision regarding the sale of assets at the 15th meeting of the Advisory Council Committee, held at the secretariat on Sunday, on the review of labour and business conditions of industrial units in Beximco Industrial Park. Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, a deputy governor of the Bangladesh Bank, additional inspector general of the Industrial Area Police, senior officials from several ministries and divisions, Nassa Group administrators and representatives of various commercial banks attended the meeting. Sakhawat said that the move would be carried out in line with the court’s directives to ensure the payment of legally determined arrears to affected workers. ‘Nassa Group has already paid Tk 76 crore to its workers by selling company shares through a court-appointed administrator,’ he added. Moreover, under the Bangladesh Bank’s directives, Nassa Group has made down payments to eight banks, he added, saying that the remaining payments to 15 banks, as well as the remaining dues of workers, would be settled through the sale of selected NASSA Group assets via open competitive bidding, in line with court instructions. The group, which employed more than 30,000 workers in its textile and garment operations and also had interests in banking and real estate, has been in a prolonged crisis since the fall of the Awami League government in August 2024. The factories under the group witnessed a series of worker unrest over the past year. Nazrul Islam Mazumder, who founded Nassa Group in 1990, was a former chairman of EXIM Bank and president of the Bangladesh Association of Banks. After the fall of the AL regime, the Bangladesh Bank removed him and his wife, Nasreen Islam, from the EXIM Bank board on August 29, 2024, and he was later arrested on October 2. Nazrul was placed on remand in various cases filed on different charges, including murder, corruption and money laundering. He is now in jail. On September 23, 2025, the government decided to shut Nassa Group’s 16 factories located in Dhaka, Gazipur, Chattogram and Cumilla export processing zone following a tripartite meeting. More than 12,000 workers were employed at Nassa Group’s 16 factories.

Two candidates had their nominations cancelled. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party leads with 10 candidates whose candidacies were upheld, including Kazi Shah Mofazzal Hossain Kaykobad (Comilla-3), Afroza Khanom (Manikganj-3), Mohammad Fahim Chowdhury (Sherpur-2), AKM Kamruzzaman (Dinajpur-5), Md Moniruzzaman (Satkhira-4), Shama Obayed Islam (Faridpur-2), Tahir Raihan Chowdhury (Sunamganj-2), Md Shawkatul Islam (Moulvibazar-2), Mushfiqur Rahman (Brahmanbaria-4) and Abdul Awal Mintoo (Feni-3).

Islami Andolan Bangladesh saw three candidates reinstated though Mohammad Azizur Rahman (Kishoreganj-1) had his nomination cancelled. The National Citizen Party and Khelafat Majlis each had one candidate reinstated, and among the independents two nominations were upheld while one was cancelled. Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker clarified the rules for dual nationals, saying that citizens holding foreign citizenship can contest elections only if they have formally renounced their foreign nationality. He explained that for the renunciation to be recognised, a candidate must submit a voluntary application, receive acknowledgement from the relevant authorities, and complete all necessary formalities, including fee payments. The process is irreversible. Anwarul Islam said that the EC had exercised its powers under Article 66(2)(a) of the constitution and the Representation of the People Order to scrutinise candidates’ citizenship. Over a nine-day hearing period from January 10 to 18, the commission examined 25 appeals concerning dual nationality to ensure compliance with the law, he said. According to the election schedule, the deadline for candidates to withdraw their nominations is January 20 while election symbols will be allocated on January 21, with campaigning beginning the following day. After 19 consecutive days of campaigning, all activities must cease at 7:30 am on February 10.

{"title": "New Age | BIDA signs deals with 11 institutions to integrate OSS portal", "body": "To further facilitate domestic and foreign investment and make business operations easier, faster and more dynamic, the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority on Monday signed memorandums of understanding with 11 service-providing institutions for integration with its One Stop Service portal. The MoU signing ceremony was held at BIDA’s conference room in Agargaon in the city, said a press release. BIDA executive chairman (state minister rank) Chowdhury Ashik Mahmud Bin Harun attended the event as chief guest, while Air Commodore (retired) Md Shaharul Huda, executive member of BIDA, presided over the programme. The MoUs were signed with four banks and seven city corporations. The banks are Rupali Bank PLC, Dhaka Bank PLC, Bank Asia PLC and Bengal Commercial Bank PLC. The city corporations include Rajshahi, Khulna, Mymensingh, Barishal, Cumilla, Gazipur and Narayanganj City Corporations. Under the MoUs, the respective banks and city corporations will integrate their systems with BIDA’s online One Stop Service platform. As a result, investors will be able to access services such as opening bank accounts, obtaining trade licences, and receiving various financial and city corporation-related investment services online in a faster, more transparent and hassle-free manner. Speaking on the occasion, Ashik said that the BIDA aimed to build a system where entrepreneurs from small business owners to large industrialists-can access all required government services through a single website and a single login. ‘We want to move away from the practice of submitting the same information repeatedly to multiple government offices. Countries that have progressed significantly in attracting investment have ensured data integrity across government agencies, allowing information to be shared seamlessly once it is submitted,’ he said. He added that although the journey towards full digital integration was not easy and will take time, Bangladesh was moving forward with strong commitment. Emphasising effective implementation of the One Stop Service, he said that launching systems alone was not enough; it was equally important to monitor service usage, identify challenges faced by investors and continuously improve service quality through feedback from partner institutions. He also congratulated the newly on-boarded institutions and thanked BIDA officials and employees for their dedicated efforts in implementing the OSS initiative. The BIDA launched its online One Stop Service portal in February 2019 in line with the One Stop Service Act, 2018 and the One Stop Service (Bangladesh Investment Development Authority) Rules, 2020, with the objective of delivering all key investment-related services from a single platform. Including the 11 institutions signed on Monday, the BIDA has so far signed MoUs with 52 institutions. Currently, 142 services from 47 agencies are being delivered through the OSS portal. A total of 215,699 applications have been processed through the system so far, and services from more institutions will be integrated in the near future. At the event, BIDA director general Jibon Krishna Saha Roy made a comprehensive presentation on the One Stop Service operations, while deputy director Abu Mohammad Nurul Hayat Totul moderated the programme.

In a letter issued on Monday, the EC invited political parties to attend the briefing, which would outline the procedures about and provide updated information on postal voting through the Postal Vote BD app. Recently, the BNP and the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami claimed that the Election Commission was favouring a particular party. At the same time, the National Citizen Party alleged that the commission issued one-sided rulings in favour of the BNP during hearings on nomination-related appeals. Amid accusations from major political parties that the Election Commission is biased, the commission has organised the briefing for all parties. Although the Election Commission’s letter stated that the briefing would provide updated information on postal voting, political leaders said that they would voice their concerns and criticisms regarding the commission’s role during the session. According to the EC, the referendum and the 13th Jatiya Sangsad election would be held on February 12. The scrutiny of nomination papers of contesting candidates and the hearing of appeals have already been completed. It said that election symbols would be allocated on January 21, while election campaigning would begin on January 22. The EC said that registered voters, both at home and abroad, would be able to start casting their votes through the Postal Vote BD app once symbols are allocated. The briefing is aimed at ensuring clarity about and transparency of the related voting activities and the latest updates, the EC letter said. The commission requested that each of the political parties taking part in the election send two representatives with technical knowledge of postal voting. In the case of independent candidates, the EC said, the candidate may attend personally or nominate a suitably qualified representative with technical expertise in postal voting. The briefing would take place at the EC auditorium from 4:00pm to 5:30pm. Meanwhile, BNP student wing Chhatra Dal staged a sit-in programme for the second day in front of the EC headquarters on Monday, questioning the commission’s neutrality ahead of the general polls. The sit-in programme rolled into the second consecutive day for pressing their three demands. The demands include stopping the ‘manipulation of expatriate postal ballots’, cancelling the unprecedented EC gazette notification to hold Shahjalal University of Science and Technology students’ union polls before the general polls under pressure from a student body of a particular political party, and refraining from partisan activities of the commission under pressure from the specific political party. Several thousand leaders and activists blocked roads near the EC building demanding free, fair and credible elections. They started the road block at about 11:00am and withdrew the protests at about 5:00om after getting assurance that their demands would be addressed. On Sunday, they held a sit-in programme from 10:00am to 8:00pm and withdrew the blockade after getting assurance from the EC that their demands would be accepted. Members of the Bangladesh Army, the police, the Border Guard Bangladesh and other law enforcement agencies were seen in guard with barricade on adjacent roads to the EC. Asked about the distrust in the EC’s neutrality, commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker said that major parties, including the BNP, Jamaat, and NCP, had raised questions about the commission’s neutrality, which meant that the commission was heading in the right direction.

While the global economy appears to be ‘shaking off the trade and tariff disruptions of 2025,’ this does not mean they had no impact, said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. Instead, the challenges were offset by ‘tailwinds from the AI and tech investment boom,’ he told reporters. This was especially true in North America and Asia, the IMF said. The private sector also showed adaptability in dealing with trade shocks, while fiscal and monetary support provided boosts. After he returned to the White House last January, US president Donald Trump unleashed sweeping tariffs that hit allies and competitors alike, roiling financial markets and supply chains while causing trade tensions to rocket. But temperatures cooled over the year as the Trump administration struck tariff deals with several partners and crucially reached a temporary truce with the world’s second-biggest economy, China. For now, global inflation is expected to drop from an estimated 4.1 per cent in 2025 to 3.8 per cent in 2026. Trump’s latest tariff threats against eight European countries in a standoff over the Danish territory of Greenland have thrown a spanner in the works. ‘We see that we’re in this world in which trade tensions can erupt, geopolitical tensions can erupt. And that’s a downside risk for the global economy,’ Gourinchas told AFP during an interview in Brussels. Nonetheless, the IMF said trade policy uncertainty remains much higher than in January 2025 and there could still be occasional flare-ups. The US Supreme Court is also due to rule on the legality of Trump’s use of emergency economic powers to impose tariffs on goods from virtually all trading partners. The high court is widely expected to deliver a decision in early 2026, the fund said. The strikedown of some duties would ‘inject another dose of trade policy uncertainty into the global economy,’ Gourinchas added. One concern is how Trump could tap other legal authorities to reimpose tariffs. Another issue is how the court ruling would impact government revenues, and therefore fiscal policies, he added. Besides trade, the AI boom pushing the global economy forward comes with its own risks, Gourinchas said. He flagged the risk of a ‘market correction’ if expectations about AI gains, productivity and profitability are not realized. A major catalyst of recent Wall Street stock records has been bullish sentiment about artificial intelligence. However, if growth due to AI turns out to be unrealistic, a big drop in the stock market — a correction — could damage the economy if consumers pull back. The pickup in tech investment and expenditure was estimated to add around 0.3 percentage points to average annualized US GDP growth in the first three quarters of 2025. This offset a drag from the lengthy government shutdown late in the year. Gourinchas noted the divergence between the United States — which is seeing a jump in AI tech investment — and other advanced economies. The IMF estimates US growth at 2.4 per cent this year, 0.3 percentage points higher than predicted in October. In contrast, it expects euro area growth of 1.3 per cent, and a slower pace in Japan. Growth in China and India is also ‘relatively strong’ compared with other emerging markets, Gourinchas said. Most of the upward revision in global growth this time was accounted for by the United States and China, the IMF said. Looking ahead, Gourinchas stressed the need for central bank independence, so that they can pursue their mandate of price stability and financial stability. He did not comment on an ongoing US Justice Department probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. But he noted that the importance of the US dollar for the international monetary system means it is ‘even more important’ the Fed is able to do its job and do it well.

{"title": "New Age | Govt employees’ pay likely to double", "body": "Pay commission to submit report tomorrow The National Pay Commission 2025 has finalised its report, recommending over 100 per cent hike in pays for the government employees who are serving at lower levels in the 20-grade salary structure. Officials said that pay hikes for officers serving between the grade-9 to the grade-1 were likely to be ranged between 75 per cent and over 54 per cent. An employee of grade-20 receives Tk 8,250 and an officer of grade-1 receives Tk 78,000 as per previous pay hikes in 2015. There is a recommendation to set the ratio between the highest and the lowest salaries at 1:8 from the current 1:9. The commission calculated that Tk 70,000 crore to Tk 80,000 crore would be required for the full implementation of the recommendations. Economists said that the implementation of the pay hikes would increase fiscal burdens and would also increase money supply to the market, pushing up the inflation rate which has been prevailing high over the past three years. The pay commission led by former finance secretary Zakir Ahmed Khan is going to apprise finance adviser Salehuddin Ahmed tomorrow afternoon over its recommendations at the secretariat in the capital Dhaka. On the same day, both the finance adviser and the pay commission chairman will meet chief adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus to submit the report. Officials said most of the recommendations of the current pay commission were going to be almost similar to those of the previous commission. Former World Bank Dhaka office chief economist Zahid Hussain said that the implementation of the new pay scale was linked to affordability since it would escalate fiscal burden amid resource constraints and growing expenditures for interest payment. The tenure of the interim government will expire after the national elections on February 12, shifting the implementation responsibility to the new elected government. Among priorities of the new elected government payment for power subsidy and arrears will be more pressing, said Zahid, adding that the interim government often struggled to manage Tk 5000 crore and pay the power arrears. The previous pay commission, headed by former Bangladesh Bank governor Mohammed Farashuddin, was appointed in November 2013. The Awami League-led regime that was ousted in August 2024 amid a mass uprising implemented the major recommendations of the previous pay commission in two phases — salary hikes in July 2015 and other benefits in July 2016. Centre for Policy Dialogue executive director Fahmida Khatun said that the public sector salaries saw an almost 100 per cent increase. Economists said that the growth rate of salaries and allowances of the government employees would be higher than the prevailing inflation. They said that the government had failed to ensure salary hikes in the private sector, matching with the pay hikes for the public sector over the past years. The ‘White Paper on the State of the Bangladesh Economy’, which was submitted to the interim government in December 2024, criticised the 2015 pay hikes by almost 100 per cent, describing those as an attempt to appease the bureaucracy following the controversial 2014 Jatiya Sangsad elections. The white paper, prepared by a team of economists led by Debapriya Bhattacharya under a policy of the interim government, noted that that the pay hikes, coupled with low revenue generation, had contributed to a growing public debt and rising interest payments on loans. On November 9, 2025, the finance adviser said that the decision about the pay hike for the public servants would be made by the new elected government as the issue could not be settled by the interim administration. The interim government has increased non-development budget allocation by Tk 22,000 crore in the revised budget for the 2025-26 financial year, so that the elected government can make partial implementation of the recommendations. The commission, appointed on July 27, 2025, has been asked to submit its recommendations within six months after it starts its operation. The pay commission that held its first meeting on August 14 is scheduled to complete its tenure on February 14, two days after the 13th Jatiya Sangsad elections scheduled for February 12.

{"title": "New Age | Gold hits record $4,690 an ounce", "body": "Gold and silver prices hit record highs and stock markets slid Monday as investors sought safety after US president Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs over opposition to his Greenland ambitions. European countries including Denmark, of which Greenland is an autonomous territory, said they ‘stand united’ against Trump’s vow on Saturday to hit them with tariffs of up to 25 per cent unless Greenland is ceded to the United States. ‘Gold surged to a record high and stocks wobbled as fresh worries about Greenland surfaced,’ noted Neil Wilson, investor strategist at Saxo UK. Gold has broken record after record in recent months as the precious commodity, along with sister metal silver, benefits from safe-haven status. The latest market unrest followed Trump’s threats against Iran last week and the recent US ouster of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro which triggered volatility in the oil market. Gold hit a peak of $4,690.59 an ounce on Monday, while silver struck an all-time high of $94.12 an ounce. The Frankfurt and Paris stock markets retreated around 1.5 per cent in late morning deals, as London shed around 0.6 per cent. The dollar fell against main rivals, including the yen. Wall Street was shut for Martin Luther King Day. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said she would dissolve parliament this week ahead of a snap election on February 8, hoping for a stronger mandate to push through her ambitious policy agenda. Reacting to Trump’s latest move over tariffs, UK prime minister Keir Starmer said a ‘trade war is in no one’s interest’. ‘The use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong,’ Starmer told a hastily-arranged press conference Monday. In stocks trading, the luxury and auto sectors were hit hard by Trump’s threats, with the share prices of LVMH and BMW each down 4.0 per cent. However, defence stocks climbed, with Germany’s Rheinmetall up 2.8 per cent and Britain’s BAE Systems gaining 1.8 per cent. The IMF on Monday upgraded its 2026 global growth forecast, citing a boost from tech investments but warning that a re-evaluation of AI productivity gains or renewed trade tensions could bring disruptions. World economic growth is projected to hold steady at 3.3 per cent this year, the International Monetary Fund said, raising its forecast by 0.2 percentage points from October. This would match the pace of growth in 2025. China’s economy grew at one of the slowest rates in decades last year, official data revealed Monday, as authorities struggled to overcome low consumer spending and a debt crisis in the property sector. Chinese stocks closed mixed at the start of the new trading week.

{"title": "New Age | Hasina, Tarique Siddique, 11 DGFI officers face trial", "body": "ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCE The International Crimes Tribunal-1 on Monday began the trial of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, former defence adviser retired major general Tarique Ahmed Siddique, and 11 serving and retired DGFI and army officers for their alleged involvement in crimes against humanity during the Awami League regime. The charges against them include enforced disappearance, abduction, illegal detention, and torture of people who hold dissenting views against the regime. The three-member tribunal, headed by Justice Md Golam Mortuza Mozumder, began the trial by recording testimony of enforced disappearance victim Hummam Quader Chowdhury, the younger son of executed BNP leader Salahuddin Quader Chowdhury. Hummam is also a BNP candidate for the Chattogram-7 constituency in the next general election. Before his testimony, chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam submitted his opening statement, describing the case as the tribunal’s first trial over enforced disappearances. Three detained army officers were in the dock. 10 other accused, including Hasina and Tarique Siddique, are in hiding and facing the trial in absentia. The tribunal set January 25 for cross-examining Hummam by the defence of the three detained army officers and by the tribunal-appointed counsel for the 10 absconding accused. The tribunal charged the 13 accused on December 18, 2025. Hummam, testifying before the tribunal, demanded the trial of those who ordered, carried out and facilitated his enforced disappearance, secret detention and torture. He sought capital punishment for Sheikh Hasina, former senior military and intelligence officials, and their associates for their alleged roles in the crime. He named former DGFI directors lieutenant general Md Akbar Hossain and major general Md Saiful Abedin, and brigadier general Tawhidul Islam, former director of the Counter Terrorism and Intelligence Bureau, as key officials involved in the crime. Hummam said that he was picked up at about 9:00am on August 4, 2016, near Bangshal police station while he was on his way to the Dhaka Chief Metropolitan Magistrate’s Court. His mother, private security personnel and driver were accompanying him in a car from their Dhanmondi home. He said that he was first taken to the officer-in-charge’s room at Bangshal police station and later shifted to the Detective Branch, where the then DB chief Monirul Islam publicly denied his arrest. That night, he said, he was moved in a microbus, blindfolded and handcuffed. He believed the vehicle passed Mohakhali flyover and the Prime Minister’s Office area before he was handed over to another group. He testified that he was later taken to a detention facility inside the cantonment area. He said that he realised this from the condition of the roads and the sound of an old gate opening. Hummam said that he was sprayed on the face and nose, taken to a cell, seated on a chair and medically examined. He testified that he regularly heard Quran recitation and crying from a neighbouring cell. After August 5, 2024, he learnt that the detainee was Brigadier general Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, son of former Jamaat chief Ghulam Azam. He said that this made him realise that many people were secretly detained in the same building. Hummam said that the light and ceiling fan in his cell were kept on at all times as part of psychological torture. The cell had a table and a plastic chair. The table bore an inscription reading ‘CTIB – Counter Terrorism and Intelligence Bureau.’ He said that he was labelled ‘VIP-1’ and given medicines without labels during illness. When a swelling developed on his leg, he underwent a surgery inside the cell under local anaesthesia. He testified that he was injected repeatedly, causing burning sensations, and was interrogated in a separate cell while blindfolded and handcuffed. During interrogation, he was questioned about alleged links with ISI, RAW, CIA and anti-Awami League activities. Hummam said that he heard individuals speaking Hindi outside his cell. One person identified him as the son of Salauddin Quader Chowdhury. He testified that he was stripped and photographed during his first interrogation and later given clothes. He said that he marked the wall of his cell with his initials ‘HQC’ and the date of his enforced disappearance. He remained detained for about seven months. Hummam said that he identified the detention centre—popularly known as Aynaghar—when he visited it with the chief adviser of the interim government after August 5, 2024. He said that the official name of the facility was JIC. He testified that he was released on March 2, 2017, and dropped near his Dhanmondi home. His house guard initially failed to recognise him due to his long hair and beard. Besides Hasina and Tarique Siddique, the other accused in the case are serving major generals Sheikh Md Sarwar Hossain and Kabir Ahmed, and brigadier generals Mahbub Rahman Siddique and Ahmed Tanvir Mazhar Siddique, and retired army officers lieutenant general Md Akbar Hossain (former DGFI director general), major general Md Saiful Abedin (former DGFI DG), lieutenant general Md Saiful Alam (former DGFI DG), lieutenant general Ahmed Tabrez Shams Chowdhury (former DGFI DG), major general Hamidul Huq (former DGFI DG), major general Mohammad Towhidul-Ul Islam (former DGFI director) and lieutenant colonel Mokhsurul Haq. Three of the serving officers, Sarwar Hossain, Mahbub Rahman and Tanvir Mazhar, are now detained in the sub jail inside the Dhaka Cantonment. The prosecution alleged that the crimes were committed at the Joint Interrogation Cell of the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence inside Dhaka Cantonment. According to the charges, 26 people, including former brigadier general Abdullahil Amaan Azmi, Chittagong Hill Tracts-based UPDF leader Michael Chakma and Hummam, were forcibly disappeared, abducted, tortured and illegally detained at the JIC between July 2, 2017 and March 4, 2020. The prosecution said that the five former DGFI directors general were placed on forced retirement after the fall of the Awami League regime on August 5, 2024 amid a mass uprising. The JIC case is the second enforced disappearance case linked to the Joint Interrogation Cell at the DGFI’s secret detention facility during the Awami League regime. The ICT-1 is scheduled for today to begin the trial of another enforced disappearance case against 17 accused allegedly involved in the second phase of abduction, detention and torture of people at the Task Force for Interrogation Cell run by the Rapid Action Battalion. Hasina, former home minister Asaduzzaman, Tarique Siddique, and 14 former RAB officers, including 11 army officers deputed to the RAB-1 and the three police officers deputed to RAB as directors general, are accused in the case.

{"title": "New Age | China economy grows 5pc in 2025, slowest in decades", "body": "China’s economy grew at one of the slowest rates in decades last year, according to official data released Monday, as authorities struggle to overcome low consumer spending and a debt crisis in the property sector. The five-per cent expansion was in line with Beijing’s annual target — a low-ball figure analysts have likened to a political comfort blanket. But observers warned it was driven largely by exports and masked weak sentiment on the ground. In a sign of the work ahead for leaders, the data also showed a significant slowdown in the last quarter of the year as expected, growing at 4.5 per cent. ‘The impact of changes in the external environment has deepened,’ said National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) official Kang Yi. ‘The domestic contradiction of strong supply and weak demand is prominent, and there are still many old problems and new challenges in economic development,’ he told a news briefing. While the reading was in line with the government’s target of ‘around five per cent’ — allowing officials to declare victory — Chinese consumers remain jittery about the wider economy and high unemployment. That is despite officials relaxing fiscal policy and subsidising the replacement of household items in a sputtering bid to boost spending. ‘Everyone is thinking harder about their spending under these poor economic conditions,’ Yang Qing, a woman visiting a tourist area in Shanghai, told AFP. Policies and measures to boost consumption would continue into 2026, Kang noted, including the trade-in scheme for old household appliances. ‘The gradual implementation of policies to clear unreasonable restrictions in the consumption sector will support consumption growth,’ he said. Figures on Monday also showed that growth in retail sales, a key indicator of consumption, slowed to 3.7 per cent last year from four per cent in 2024. For December, the reading came in at 0.9 per cent on-year — the weakest pace since the end of 2022, when stringent zero-Covid measures ended. The decline in sales likely reflects the waning impact of consumer subsidies, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics wrote in a note. But overall figures likely ‘overstate the strength of the economy’, she said. Industrial output expanded 5.9 per cent in 2025, a slight slowdown from the previous year, while the 5.2-per cent increase seen in December was an improvement on November’s pace. ‘The December activity data suggest that output growth gained some momentum at the end of the year, but that’s largely driven by resilient exports,’ Huang said. ‘We expect growth this year to be at least slightly softer than in 2025,’ she added. Officials were keen to point to China’s factory activity, which ticked up slightly in December to provide an unexpected silver lining to an otherwise lacklustre year’s end. A key measure of industrial health, the manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, ticked up to 50.1 last month, according to NBS data, just above the 50-point mark separating contractions from expansions. The figure had not been positive since March. But China’s property sector, once a major indicator of the country’s economic strength, is mired in a debt crisis despite interest rate cuts and loosened restrictions on homebuying. Fixed-asset investments in China shrunk 3.8 per cent in 2025, reflecting a rebalancing following decades of heavy spending on property and infrastructure. The broader housing market remains sluggish, with real estate investment down 17.2 per cent last year. Donald Trump’s return to the White House last January and the revival of a fierce trade war between the world’s two largest economies added to Beijing’s problems. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump reached a tentative truce when they met in late October, agreeing to pause painful measures that included lofty tit-for-tat tariffs. Official data showed Chinese exports to the United States plunged 20 per cent in 2025, but that had little impact on demand for Chinese products elsewhere. Despite the bruising trade war, robust exports remained a bright spot in the cloudy economic picture. China’s trade surplus hit a record $1.2 trillion last year, with officials lauding a ‘new historical high’ filled by other trade partners than the United States. Shipments to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations rose 13.4 per cent year-on-year, while exports to African countries surged 25.8 per cent. Exports to the European Union were also up 8.4 per cent, though imports from the bloc dipped. Wang Dongdong, a Shanghai local working in international trade, said his business had done well enough last year that he felt confident splurging on a new car and a trip to Japan. ‘I think 2026 will be better than 2025, based on international trends,’ he told AFP.

{"title": "New Age | Resilience of banking sector to define growth trajectory: ICCB", "body": "As Bangladesh advances toward upper-middle-income status, the resilience and credibility of its banking sector will define the nation’s growth trajectory, according to the editorial of the latest News Bulletin (Oct-December 2025) released on Monday by the International Chamber of Commerce-Bangladesh. The ICCB report described the banking system as the backbone of Bangladesh’s economic journey, responsible for mobilizing savings, financing trade, and generating employment. However, the editorial warned that the sector currently stands at a critical inflection point, facing significant structural challenges that require urgent governance reforms and a strong, autonomous central bank. The most pressing concern highlighted in the report is the massive accumulation of non-performing loans. The total volume of NPLs has reached over Tk 6.44 lakh crore, constituting approximately 35.7 per cent of all outstanding loans — a figure the ICCB describes as an alarming level by international standards. The editorial noted that these excessive NPLs weaken bank balance sheets, reduce lending capacity, and discourage new investment, ultimately posing serious risks to the broader macro-economy. While recent regulatory actions have forced banks to report defaulted loans more accurately, the ICCB emphasized the need to distinguish between wilful default and genuine business distress to ensure that deliberate financial misconduct is addressed firmly while viable enterprises receive support. In a move described as the largest in Bangladesh’s financial history, the Bank Resolution Ordinance 2025 was recently enacted to handle distressed financial institutions. Under this new framework, five Shariah-based banks were consolidated into a single state-owned entity to stabilize systemic risk and safeguard depositors. While acknowledging that consolidation can reduce contagion risk, the ICCB noted that experts have raised questions regarding shareholder approval under the Companies Act for merging publicly listed companies. The editorial stresses that the success of such measures relies on accountability, improved governance and modern risk-management standards. The ICCB report placed heavy emphasis on the necessity of a strong, professional and independent Bangladesh Bank. Global experience suggests that an independent central bank is essential for handling financial pressures, maintaining economic confidence, and attracting investment. Over the past two years, the Bangladesh Bank has implemented extraordinary measures — including liquidity support and refinancing facilities — to protect depositors and preserve stability during financial stress. However, the report asserts that while emergency funding is useful during crises, long-term health depends on strong governance and prudent lending To support Bangladesh’s goals of export diversification, technological innovation, and infrastructure development, the financial system must evolve. The ICCB called for strict action against wilful defaulters, globally aligned compliance standards, and continuous regulatory capacity building. The editorial concluded that building resilience is not solely the job of regulators but requires the constructive support of bank boards, management, policymakers, and the business community to create a financial system that commands domestic and international trust.

{"title": "New Age | No deadline set by ICC on WC participation: BCB", "body": "No deadline was set by the International Cricket Council regarding the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s decision to participate in the forthcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, said the BCB on Monday. The ICC have not officially commented, but the website Cricinfo and other Indian media reported on Monday that the deadline of Wednesday had been set for Dhaka to make a decision. However, Amzad Hussain, the chairman of the media committee of the BCB, denied the claims. ‘On last Saturday, January 17, a representative from the ICC came [to Dhaka]. There was a meeting between him and a representative team from our cricket board. There we requested to arrange alternate venues after informing them that we were unable to play in some venues,’ he told reporters at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Monday. ‘We have had detailed conversations with representatives. Then they said that they would inform the ICC of the issues, and the decision would be provided later. They didn’t specify any date. They only said that they would inform us at a later date,’ he added. According to Agence France-Presse, Bangladesh can be replaced by Scotland, the highest-ranked team who did not qualify, if the BCB doesn’t agree to play their matches in India in the forthcoming World Cup. According to several other reports published in Indian media, the ICC had told Bangladesh to agree to play their matches at next month’s T20 World Cup in India or risk being kicked out of the tournament. The BCB is refusing to play in India, citing security concerns, and have asked the governing International Cricket Council to shift their matches to co-hosts Sri Lanka. The BCB held talks in Dhaka on Saturday with ICC officials over the impasse, but no agreement was reached. ‘During the discussions, the BCB reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka,’ a BCB statement said. ‘The Board also shared the Bangladesh Government’s views and concerns on the safety and security of the team, Bangladeshi fans, media and other stakeholders,’ it added. The T20 World Cup begins on February 7, with Bangladesh in England’s Group C and scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai. One suggestion was for Bangladesh to swap with Group B’s Ireland, whose matches are in Sri Lanka. ‘Among other points, the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed,’ said the BCB. Pakistan will play all their matches in Colombo under an ICC agreement with India to play at neutral venues in global or regional tournaments. However, according to a report published on Cricinfo, the ICC did not agree to BCB’s request to consider moving Bangladesh to Group B, swapping places with Ireland, who play their group matches in Sri Lanka. The ICC is understood to have assured the BCB that there is no security threat to Bangladesh. The row erupted on January 3, when the IPL’s Kolkata Knight Riders were ordered by India’s cricket board to drop Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman, sparking fury in Dhaka. On January 4, the BCB sent a letter to the ICC requesting to relocate their matches outside India. The government also banned the broadcasting of the Indian Premier League in Bangladesh.

{"title": "New Age | BPL play-off begins today", "body": "The play-off of the Bangladesh Premier League starts with first qualifier and the eliminator at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Mirpur today. Third-placed Rangpur Riders will take on Sylhet Titans in the eliminator match starting at 1:00pm, followed by the first qualifier between the top two seeded Rajshahi Warriors and Chattogram Royals at 6:00pm. The winner of the first qualifier will go through to the final directly, whereas the losing team will get another chance in the second qualifier, where they face the winner of the eliminator. On the other hand, the losing team of the eliminator will be knocked out. The second qualifier of the BPL will take place on January 21, while the final is scheduled for January 23. The BCB has changed the starting timing of the final, as it will now begin at 6:00pm instead of 7:00pm. Rajshahi, who finished the league stage with eight wins out of 10, are on a four-match winning streak, including against their opponent of the qualifier, Chattogram. Their Kiwi all-rounder, Jimmy Neesham, said that they were confident to go all the way. ‘Confident with, with how we’ve been playing. Obviously, finishing top of the table was the first goal at the start of any competition. So, we’ve achieved that first goal and sort of earned the right to have a second chance in the finals if we lose that first game,’ he told reporters ahead of the first qualifier. ‘So, yeah, the team is feeling confident. Having said that, it’s a new game tomorrow. Both teams start even, so we’ll have to perform well again. But hopefully we can continue the form that we’ve had over the last few games,’ he added. Chattogram, on the other hand, lost their last two matches of the league stage after securing their place in the play-off. On both occasions, their top-order failed to turn up. However, after going through an ownership transition as the BCB had to take over them just before the scheduled beginning of the season, Chattogram showed their spirit throughout the tournament under the captaincy of Mahedi Hasan. Sylhet also lost their last match of the league stage after qualifying for the play-off. They have now been boosted with the joining of English wicketkeeper-batter Sam Billings. Billings, who was playing for Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash League, joined his compatriots Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes and Ethan Brookes as the overseas signings for Sylhet on Monday. Rangpur, one of the strongest teams on paper, had to overcome their three-match losing streak before securing a top-four finish. They changed their captain midway as Nurul Hasan was replaced by the national T20I captain, Litton Das. However, two consecutive wins should give them confidence as they start their final hurdle.

{"title": "New Age | Barca beaten at Sociedad", "body": "Real Sociedad damaged Barcelona’s title defence ambitions as Goncalo Guedes gave them a surprise 2-1 La Liga victory on Sunday, consigning Hansi Flick’s side to a first defeat in 12 matches. Alexander Sorloth’s towering header earned Atletico Madrid a narrow 1-0 win over Alaves on Sunday in La Liga, helping them pull level on points with third-placed Villarreal. Barcelona, who hit the woodwork four times and had two goals disallowed, now only lead rivals Real Madrid by a single point at the top of the table after Alvaro Arbeloa’s side beat Levante on Saturday. Sociedad’s Mikel Oyarzabal put the hosts ahead and immediately after Marcus Rashford equalised for Barcelona, Guedes struck the winner. La Real, now unbeaten in four games under new American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo, had Carlos Soler sent off late on but managed to hold on to triumph and climb up to eighth. ‘I said to the team we played good, we were unlucky. Some days are like this and you don’t know why you lose but this is one day and now we have to focus on the next game,’ Flick told reporters. La Real goalkeeper Alex Remiro made several crucial saves to keep Barca at bay. ‘Three great points and a great game,’ said Remiro. ‘We’ve started this year in great form... this is the energy we have, how we’ve changed (recently).’ In a frantic start to a compelling game at the rainy Reale Arena, both teams had goals ruled out. La Real had the ball in the net inside 30 seconds when Oyarzabal headed home Guedes’s cross, but had strayed offside. At the other end, Barcelona’s Fermin Lopez drilled home from range but Dani Olmo had committed a foul in the build-up and it was ruled out. With teenage winger Lamine Yamal at his tricky best, Barca got in often down the right flank. Yamal had a goal ruled out himself for an extremely tight offside call, before Sociedad took the lead against the run of play. Oyarzabal lashed home Guedes’s cross with a blistering volley inside Joan Garcia’s near post. Barcelona turned up the pressure in the second half and Real Sociedad were left depending on Remiro and the frame of the goal to keep the Catalans at bay. Olmo crashed a shot against the post from Lopez’s cross and then Remiro denied the Barca midfielder with a fine near-post save. Remiro then tipped substitute Robert Lewandowski’s header against the crossbar with the save of the night. Another Barca substitute, Rashford, eventually pulled the champions level, heading Yamal’s cross home after 70 minutes. However, the hosts immediately regained their advantage after Barca goalkeeper Garcia spilled Carlos Soler’s shot. The midfielder was able to gather the rebound and cross for Guedes, who fired La Real ahead again. They should have got a third when Garcia, out of his goal, had no chance of saving Oyarzabal’s effort but Pau Cubarsi headed the ball off the line. Barcelona came within inches of an equaliser when Joao Cancelo, on his second debut for the club, crossed for Jules Kounde, who headed against the crossbar. Soler was dismissed for an ugly foul on Pedri before nine minutes of stoppage time were added on. Rashford hit the post directly from a corner kick as Barca pushed until the end but could not find a way through. ‘I think we deserved to win today, we had a lot of chances, but in the end you have to put them away,’ Barca midfielder Frenkie de Jong told DAZN, before complaining about referee Jesus Gil Manzano. The midfielder said he thought the referee was arrogant, and Flick agreed. ‘I don’t want to waste energy on him,’ said Flick, referring to Gil Manzano. ‘Frenkie is right.’ La Real coach Matarazzo hailed his team’s ‘heart’, but admitted that his side had some fortune and was grateful for Remiro’s saves. ‘A quality goalkeeper is not luck, so it’s a mix,’ he said. After dropping points in a draw at Sociedad in their last league outing, Diego Simeone’s Atletico got back on track with Sorloth’s goal, moving seven points clear of Espanyol in fifth. After a tight first half, Atletico took the lead early in the second, with Sorloth leaping high to nod home Pablo Barrios’s cross and break the deadlock. It was the Norwegian target man’s third goal in his last three games across all competitions. ‘(Sorloth) is in his most consistent spell since joining the club,’ said Atletico coach Simeone.

{"title": "New Age | New Zealand register first ODI series win in India", "body": "New Zealand overcame a valiant 124 by Virat Kohli to down India by 41 runs and seal their first-ever ODI series victory on Indian soil on Sunday. Daryl Mitchell and Glenn Phillips guided New Zealand to 337-8 with a fourth-wicket stand of 219 after the tourists slipped to 5-2 and 58-3 in Indore. Mitchell made 137 and Phillips hit 106 off 88 balls. The Black Caps then bowled out India for 296 in 46 overs despite Kohli’s 54th ODI century and clinched the three-match series 2-1. New Zealand had lost all seven of their previous ODI series in India, a run dating back to 1988. The Black Caps registered their first ever Test series win in India with a 3-0 sweep in October 2024, and added another landmark success in this series despite being without several key players including Kane Williamson, Mitchell Santner, Tom Latham, Rachin Ravindra and Jacob Duffy. ‘We’re the sum of all the parts and we really try to work together as a group -- that’s part of the Kiwi way,’ captain Michael Bracewell said. ‘We’re just a small country from the bottom of the world and we try to work together to take on some of the bigger countries in the world.’ He added: ‘We really rally around there as a group and when things come like that, it’s pretty special.’ India -- the world’s most populated nation with 1.4 billion people -- are the top-ranked ODI side ahead of New Zealand. The in-form Kohli, who plays just the 50-over format after retiring from Test and T20 international cricket, threatened to pull off a remarkable chase in a 99-run seventh-wicket partnership with Harshit Rana, who made 52. New Zealand left-arm spinner Jayden Lennox returned figures of 2-42 from his 10 overs after Bracewell left the field with a calf injury and did not return. Mitchell led the team in Bracewell’s absence, which also left New Zealand a bowler short. Zak Foulkes and fellow seamer Kristian Clarke took three wickets each. India slumped to 71-4 before Kohli hit back in an 88-run stand with Nitish Kumar Reddy, who made 53, and then with Rana. ‘The way Virat is batting, that’s definitely a plus always,’ said India captain Shubman Gill. ‘The way Harshit has batted in the series, batting at number eight, it’s not easy.’ Kohli struck 10 fours and three sixes in his 108-ball knock before he was caught off Clarke and walked back to a rousing ovation after his 85th international century. Earlier the in-form Mitchell picked up from where he left off after his match-winning 131 not out in the second ODI, which levelled the series at 1-1. Mitchell reached his ninth ODI ton with a single off Ravindra Jadeja before Phillips also brought up his hundred. Arshdeep finally dismissed Phillips caught behind to end the marathon stand and Mitchell soon followed, falling to Mohammed Siraj. Mitchell was named player of the match and series for his 352 runs in three matches. New Zealand wobbled, losing four more wickets but Bracewell hammered an unbeaten 28 off 18 balls. The teams next play five T20 matches in a final tune-up for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka between February 7 and March 8.

{"title": "New Age | Klopp ‘surprised and not surprised’ by Alonso’s Madrid exit", "body": "Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said Xabi Alonso’s Real Madrid exit was a surprise but also predictable from the European giants known for cut-throat coaching decisions. Former Real midfielder Alonso lasted less than eight months in the Bernabeu dugout, leaving the club by ‘mutual agreement’ a day after being outplayed in a 3-2 defeat by Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. ‘When I heard the news about Xabi Alonso, it was a bit of a mix. Yes, I was surprised. And no, I wasn’t surprised,’ Klopp told AFP and other media in Leipzig. ‘I was like ‘what?’ And ‘yeah, of course’.’ Referencing Madrid sacking German manager Jupp Heynckes in 1998 eight days after winning the Champions League for failing to win La Liga, Klopp said ‘it’s always like that from Madrid when they’re not first in the table.’ The 58-year-old, who has been working as Red Bull’s global head of football for a year, said Real did not seem to have a plan post-Alonso and may struggle to find the right replacement. ‘I have no clue why it happened, but it’s always a specific case and not a general problem, because what they see now, Real Madrid, is that bringing in just the next one is not that easy. ‘I would recommend if you sack a manager, you better have an idea who you want to succeed him. ‘And it should be realistic. If they think they can get Pep Guardiola, I would say there’s not a big chance.’ The one-time Borussia Dortmund coach dismissed rumours linking him to the Real dugout as media speculation. ‘I’m in a place, as a person, where I’m completely at peace with where I am. I don’t want to be somewhere else. ‘I don’t get up and excited if Real Madrid are showing interest -- if they would be -- but it’s the media.’ Klopp won an array of trophies including league titles in England and Germany along with the Champions League with Liverpool, but said he still felt his time as a manager was over. ‘Do I want to coach again?

{"title": "New Age | Villa’s title bid rocked by Everton loss", "body": "Aston Villa’s Premier League title challenge suffered a huge blow in a 1-0 defeat against Everton, while Newcastle’s push towards the top four was derailed by a 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday. Unai Emery’s side could have closed to within four points of leaders Arsenal if they had beaten Everton at Villa Park. But they wasted the chance to put pressure on the Gunners with a limp performance that was punished by Thierno Barry’s second-half winner. After Arsenal’s goalless draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Mikel Arteta’s men are seven points clear of third-placed Villa. Second-placed Manchester City are also seven points behind the leaders following their 2-0 loss at Manchester United on Saturday. Arsenal are chasing a first English title since 2004 and the stumbles from City and Villa this weekend have tightened their grip on the title race. ‘There are other teams with more potential than us,’ Emery said of Villa’s fading title chances. ‘We lost a very good opportunity. We did a very good season until now, but today we lost. ‘We had our chances, we didn’t score and they had less chances, but they scored.’ Adding to Villa’s woes, their captain John McGinn limped off with a first-half injury. Villa had won their previous 11 home games in all competitions. But Everton’s Merlin Rohl nearly shattered that feeling of invincibility in just 11 seconds when he capitalised on sloppy defending to shoot against the post. Despite being a boyhood Villa fan, Everton winger Jack Grealish was loudly jeered on his return to his former club. Grealish almost silenced his tormentors with a goal-bound volley that was blocked by Evann Guessand. Everton’s Jake O’Brien headed home from a corner, only to see his effort disallowed for offside against Harrison Armstrong. Villa went close just before half-time when Youri Tielemans’s cross picked out Guessand and the Ivory Coast forward looped his header onto the bar. But Emery’s men lacked a cutting edge and they paid the price in the 59th minute. It was a shambolic goal to concede as Pau Torres carelessly surrendered possession just outside his own area. Dwight McNeil pounced with a shot that Emiliano Martinez pushed out to Barry and the striker chipped the ball into the net from close range for his third goal in his last five appearances. Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford preserved Everton’s victory with a brilliant tip-over from Morgan Rogers’s curler, leaving Villa with only one win from their last four league games. At rain-lashed Molineux, Eddie Howe’s Newcastle were unable to prise open the Wolves defence as two points slipped away. Wins over Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds had bolstered their bid to qualify for next season’s Champions League. But the Magpies are stuck in eighth place after failing to beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves. Following their disappointing 2-0 defeat against Manchester City in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday, it was another frustrating result for Newcastle. ‘We needed to do more in attack. I expected us to do better and create more,’ Howe said after Newcastle took 85 minutes to muster a shot on target. ‘Football is such a strange game. We scored four against Leeds and looked free-scoring, but today we struggled.’ Nick Woltemade has now gone seven games without a goal, scoring just twice in 13 appearances after squandering two good headed chances. With crucial matches against top-four rivals Aston Villa and Liverpool looming before the end of the month, Howe’s men must get back on track quickly. Wolves are now unbeaten in four league games but still sit 14 points from safety.

{"title": "New Age | Syrian army deploys in former Kurdish-held areas", "body": "CEASEFIRE DEAL Syria’s army deployed in formerly Kurdish-led areas in the country’s east and north on Monday after a ceasefire announced a day earlier, as Syria’s president and the Kurds’ leader were set to hold talks. The leader of the Syrian Kurdish forces said Sunday he agreed to the deal with Damascus to avoid broader war, integrating the Kurds’ administration and his fighters into the state after months of stalled negotiations. Despite the deal, the government and the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces traded blame on Monday for fresh attacks that the military said killed three soldiers. Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa announced the accord with SDF chief Mazloum Abdi following two days of rapid gains in Kurdish-controlled territory after the army pushed the SDF out of Aleppo city earlier this month. Analysts said the deal marked a blow for the minority’s long-held ambitions of preserving the de facto autonomy they had exercised in swathes of north and northeast Syria for over a decade. In Deir Ezzor province in the country’s east, an AFP correspondent saw dozens of military vehicles heading to the east of the Euphrates River, while trucks, cars and pedestrians lined up at a small bridge leading to the eastern bank. Mohammed Khalil, a 50-year-old driver said that he was overjoyed by the arrival of Syrian government forces. ‘We hope things will be better than before. There was... no freedom’ under the SDF, he said. Teacher Safia Keddo, 49, said ‘we want children to return to school without fear, and for electricity, water, and bread to be restored. We’re not asking for a miracle, we just want stability and a normal life.’ The army said it ‘started the deployment’ into Syria’s north and east ‘to secure it under the agreement’, adding that forces had reached the outskirts of Hasakeh city, whose province is the Kurds’ stronghold. The military did not say where its soldiers were killed but accused ‘terrorist groups’ of seeking to disrupt the deal’s implementation. The SDF instead accused the government of launching attacks and reported ‘violent clashes’ near a prison in Raqa that holds detainees from the Islamic State group. The agreement includes the Kurdish administration’s immediate handover of Arab-majority Deir Ezzor and Raqa provinces to the government, which will also take responsibility for IS prisoners and their families held in Kurdish-run jails and camps. The SDF had seized swathes of the provinces as they expelled the jihadists during Syria’s civil war with the support of an international coalition led by the United States. An AFP correspondent in Raqa said security forces deployed in the main square, while a military convoy passed through the city as sporadic gunfire rang out. Dozens of residents crossed the Euphrates in boats after two bridges were destroyed, while residents toppled a statue of a woman erected by Kurdish forces. Raqa resident Khaled al-Afnan, 34, said ‘we support Kurdish civil rights but we don’t support them having a military role.’ ‘This deal is important for protecting civilian lives,’ he said. The SDF on Sunday withdrew from areas under its control in the eastern Deir Ezzor countryside, including the Al-Omar oil field, the country’s largest, and the Tanak field. Local fighters from tribes in the Arab-majority province sided with Damascus and seized the areas before the arrival of government forces. Some Arab tribes were previously allied with the SDF, which included a significant Arab component. An energy ministry official told state television on Monday that technical teams were heading to recently taken oil facilities to assess their condition. The SDF’s Abdi said Sunday he agreed to the deal to avoid civil war and end a conflict ‘imposed’ on the Kurds. Mutlu Civiroglu, a Washington-based analyst and expert on the Kurds, said the government’s advance ‘raises serious doubts about the durability’ of the ceasefire and a stalled March agreement between the government and the Kurds. ‘Sharaa’s confrontations with Kurdish forces, following earlier pressure on Alawite and Druze areas, reinforce doubts about the interim government’s legitimacy and its ability to represent Syria’s diverse population,’ he added. Last year saw sectarian violence in the country’s coastal Alawite heartland and in southern Syria’s Druze-majority Sweida province. Sharaa had on Friday issued a decree granting the Kurds official recognition, but the Kurds said it fell short of their expectations. In Qamishli, the main Kurdish city in the country’s northeast, activist Hevi Ahmed, 40, said Sunday’s deal was ‘a disappointment after years of hope that the Syrian constitution might contain a better future for the Kurds.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/288660/syrian-army-deploys-in-former-kurdish-held-areas", "date": "2026-01-19T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 779}
{"title": "New Age | Japan PM calls snap election on February 8", "body": "Japanese prime minister Sanae Takaichi said Monday she would dissolve parliament this week ahead of a snap election on February 8, hoping for a stronger mandate to push through her ambitious policy agenda. The country’s first woman leader is banking on her high poll numbers to lead the unpopular ruling Liberal Democratic Party to victory. ‘Is Sanae Takaichi fit to be prime minister? I wanted to ask the sovereign people to decide,’ she told a news conference. ‘Following the dissolution of the lower house on January 23, the schedule will be set for campaigning to start on January 27 and voting and counting held on February 8.’ If elected, Takaichi pledged Monday to cut a tax on food for a two-year period to ‘alleviate the burden’ on people struggling with inflation. Takaichi’s cabinet approved a record 122.3-trillion-yen ($768 billion) budget for the fiscal year from April 2026, and she has vowed to get parliamentary approval as soon as possible to address rising prices and shore up the world’s fourth-largest economy. ‘We have a responsibility to overcome the shackles of excessive austerity and take immediate action against the crisis at hand,’ she told reporters. The LDP has governed Japan almost uninterrupted for decades, albeit with frequent leader changes. Takaichi was appointed premier in October, and her cabinet is riding high in the polls despite her party’s flagging popularity. The ruling bloc — which includes coalition partner Japan Innovation Party — has only a slim majority in the powerful lower house of parliament. This could hamper the passage of her policy agenda, including ‘proactive’ fiscal spending and boosting the defence budget. ‘If the LDP can get a majority by itself in the lower house, that’ll help her pursue policies’ without concessions to other parties, said Sadafumi Kawato, professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo. But opposition parties say Takaichi’s plan to dissolve the lower house risks delaying its passage, with Jun Azumi of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan saying it would ‘sacrifice livelihoods’. Masaaki Tokuno, a 64-year-old bicycle lot manager, said that ‘carrying out policies to tackle inflation should be first, before holding the election’. A snap election may also help Takaichi break the deadlock in a spat with China, increasing her leverage by showing she has strong support at home, analysts said. Ties between Tokyo and Beijing have deteriorated since Takaichi suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if China ever launched an attack on Taiwan, the self-ruled island it claims. China recently announced a broad ban on exports to Japan of ‘dual-use’ goods with potential military applications and has reportedly been choking off exports of rare-earth products crucial for making everything from electric cars to missiles. Takaichi denounced Monday ‘economic pressure tactics’ impacting Japan, without explicitly referring to China. These are ‘aimed at forcing other nations to submit to demands, by controlling upstream materials in supply chains that the world relies on’, she said. Mikitaka Masuyama, dean of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies, warned that if she wins, China could further intensify pressure on Takaichi. Beijing may want to send voters ‘the message that supporting a hawkish leader could lead to pain’ through more trade controls or other means. According to a poll by the Asahi newspaper, 60 per cent of people surveyed said they were worried about the impact of a worsening Japan-China relationship on the economy. Under Takaichi’s predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, the LDP and its former long-term coalition partner Komeito lost its majority in both chambers in the past two national elections — most recently in the July upper house election. The July election led Ishiba to step down, while smaller parties gained support — including the populist Sanseito, which called immigration a ‘silent invasion’ despite foreign-born residents making up just three per cent of the population. Komeito and the leading CDP have agreed to join forces to fight Takaichi, hoping their alliance can draw swing voters.

Families rushed to the Gul Plaza building after the blaze erupted on Saturday night at one of the coastal city’s busiest malls, where dozens of people were still missing. ‘In total 21 bodies have been recovered,’ Hassan Khan, spokesman for the Rescue 1122 Sindh emergency service, said. ‘The search operation will continue,’ he said. The dead include a 25-year-old rescuer, Khan said, while at least 30 injured people were hospitalised. Standing outside the burnt mall, Shehbaz Ghulam said his nephew’s whereabouts were unknown. ‘We have made requests to the authorities. We also request the media to help us in any way possible,’ the 45-year-old said. ‘No matter what condition he is in, if he is found and returned to us, we will find some peace,’ he said. The top police officer in Karachi’s southern district, Syed Asad Raza, said the force has ‘a list of 60 missing persons’. Rescue workers said that the blaze had been brought under control. A government committee has launched an investigation, but it was not immediately clear what had caused the fire. Among those waiting outside the mall was Muhammad Qaisar, who last heard from his wife, sister and daughter-in-law at 8:00pm on Saturday. ‘The phone kept ringing until 10:00pm, but no one answered. It continued to ring until midnight, but no one picked up,’ Qaisar, 55, said. The three-storey shopping mall housed at least 1,200 shops, offering a wide range of goods and was famous for wedding shopping and home decoration items. Shopkeepers and families criticised authorities for slow rescue efforts. Fires are common in Karachi’s markets and factories, which are known for their poor infrastructure.

{"title": "New Age | Soaring Iran executions seemingly ‘tool of state intimidation’: UN", "body": "Iran appears to be using executions ‘as a tool of state intimidation’, the United Nations said Monday, as it denounced a jump in capital punishment globally in 2025. The Islamic republic reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement. ‘The scale and pace of executions suggest a systematic use of capital punishment as a tool of state intimidation, with disproportionate impact on ethnic minorities and migrants,’ he warned. The spike in executions in Iran — which according to rights groups is the world’s most prolific executioner after China — had contributed to ‘an alarming increase’ in the use of capital punishment worldwide last year, Turk said. While the overall global trend continues to move towards universal abolition of the death penalty, Iran and a handful of other states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States saw executions surge. Many of those executions were ‘for offences not meeting the ‘most serious crimes’ threshold required under international law’, Turk said, also criticising ‘the continued execution of people convicted of crimes committed as children, as well as persistent secrecy around executions’. The sharp hike had especially been driven by a growing number of executions for drug-related offences not involving intentional killing. ‘This is not only incompatible with international law, but also ineffective in deterring crime,’ Turk insisted. In the case of Iran, at least 47 per cent of executions in 2025 had been related to drug offences, the rights office said. The percentage was even higher in Saudi Arabia, where 78 per cent of the 356 people reportedly executed there last year were sentenced for drug-related crimes. ‘At least two among those executed in Saudi Arabia were convicted of crimes committed as children, which raises serious questions with respect to children’s rights in particular,’ Turk said. In the United States, meanwhile, 47 executions were carried out in 2025 — the highest number in 16 years, the rights office said, stressing that the broadened use of gas asphyxiation for executions there raised ‘serious concerns of torture or cruel punishment’.

On December 24, 2025, the three-judge tribunal chaired by Justice Golam Mortuza Mozumder set the date after concluding the hearing of the first July case of the ICT-1. This will be the second verdict of the reconstituted ICT-1 in the first July case which accuses former DMP commissioner Habibur Rahman, four senior police officers, and three constables. The seven other accused include former DMP joint commissioner Sudip Kumar Chakraborty, former Ramna assistant deputy commissioner Shah Alam Md Akhterul Islam, former Ramna assistant commissioner Mohammad Imrul, Shahbagh police station inspector (operations) Ashrad Hossain, and suspended constables Sujan Hossain, Imaz Hossain Imon and Nasirul Islam. Of them, Ashrad, and suspended constables Sujan Hossain, Imaz Hossain Imon, and Nasirul Islam are in jail. The remaining four are still in hiding and were tried in absentia. Although deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan and detained former inspector general of police Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun were named as conspirators in the Chankharpul killings, they were not included in this case because they are already accused in a separate case over superior command responsibility for the July incidents. On November 17, Hasina and Asaduzzaman were tried in absentia and sentenced to death, while Mamun, who became a state witness, was jailed for five years. According to the charge sheet, senior police officials allegedly ordered, abetted, and facilitated the shootings, while constables carried out the firing that left six protesters dead on August 5, 2024 when Sheikh Hasina fled the country amid student-led mass uprising. The victims of the August 5 shooting are Shahriar Khan Anas, a class X student who left behind a heartbreaking letter to his mother, Sheikh Mahadi Hasan Zunayed who is also known as Mostakin, Mohammad Yakub, Md Rakib Hawlader, Mohammad Ismail Haque, and Manik Mia, also known as Saharik Chowdhury.

{"title": "New Age | Indonesians ‘released’ by Cambodian scam networks", "body": "More than 400 Indonesians were freed by cyberscam networks in Cambodia this month, Jakarta said on Monday, after Phnom Penh announced a fresh crackdown following the arrest of an alleged boss of the illicit industry. Scammers working from hubs across Southeast Asia, some willingly and others trafficked, lure internet users globally into fake romances and cryptocurrency investments, netting tens of billions of dollars each year. Hundreds of foreign nationals have left suspected scam compounds across Cambodia this month as the government pledged to ‘eliminate’ problems related to the online fraud trade, which the United Nations says employs at least 1,00,000 people in Cambodia alone. Recent Cambodian law enforcement measures resulted in ‘many online scam syndicates letting their workers go’, Indonesia’s ambassador to Cambodia, Santo Darmosumarto, said in a video posted to social media. From January 1-18, 440 Indonesians came to the embassy in Phnom Penh after they were ‘released by online scam syndicates’, many seeking to return home, according to a post on Instagram. ‘Because Cambodia’s crackdown will continue, the embassy predicts many more will flow in from the provinces,’ Santo said. Some who went to the embassy were ‘involved in online scams for years, some only arrived in Cambodia a few months ago’, he said. ‘Some still hold their passports, while others had their passports confiscated by the syndicates; some have overstayed, while others still have valid residence permits in Cambodia’ and hoped to ‘find other work’. Santo said the embassy would expedite repatriations but all Indonesians were ‘being directed to return home independently’, and warned against getting involved in criminal activity abroad. Dozens of people, some with suitcases, lined up outside the Indonesian embassy on Monday morning. An 18-year-old from Indonesia’s Sumatra said he fled a compound in Bavet city, near Cambodia’s border with Vietnam, where he was forced to scam people online for eight months without pay despite being promised $600 per month. He said he arrived in Phnom Penh on Sunday and came to the embassy to ask for a new passport because his was ‘with a Chinese boss’. ‘They heard police were coming inside the compound, so they let everyone go,’ he said. About 100 people were also queueing outside the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh on Monday afternoon, but those approached by AFP declined to speak. China’s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Beijing ‘attaches great importance to the safety of Chinese citizens overseas’ when asked at a regular news briefing about the lines outside the embassy in Cambodia. Cambodia arrested and deported Chinese-born tycoon Chen Zhi, accused of running internet scam operations from Cambodia, to China this month. Chen, a former Cambodian government adviser, was indicted by US authorities in October.

{"title": "New Age | UK, France mull social media bans for youth as debate rages", "body": "Countries including France and Britain are considering following Australia’s lead by banning children and some teenagers from using social media, but experts are still locked in a debate over the effectiveness of the move. Supporters of a ban warn that action needs to be taken to tackle deteriorating mental health among young people, but others say the evidence is inconclusive and want a more nuanced approach. Australia last month became the first nation to prohibit people under-16s from using immensely popular and profitable social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Tiktok and YouTube. France is currently debating bills for a similar ban for under-15s, including one championed by president Emmanuel Macron. The Guardian reported last week that Jonathan Haidt, an American psychologist and supporter of the Australian ban, had been asked to speak to UK government officials. Haidt argued in his bestselling 2024 book ‘The Anxious Generation’ that too much time looking at screens — particularly social media — was rewiring children’s brains and ‘causing an epidemic of mental illness’. While influential among politicians, the book has proven controversial in academic circles. Canadian psychologist Candice Odgers wrote in a review of the book that the ‘scary story’ Haidt was telling was ‘not supported by science’. One of the main areas of disagreement has been determining exactly how much effect using social media has on young people’s mental health. Michael Noetel, a researcher at the University of Queensland in Australia, said that ‘small effects across billions of users add up’. There is ‘plenty of evidence’ that social media does harm to teens, he said, adding that some were demanding an unrealistic level of proof. ‘My read is that Haidt is more right than his harshest critics admit, and less right than his book implies,’ Noetel said. Given the potential benefit of a ban, he considered it ‘a bet worth making’. After reviewing the evidence, France’s public health watchdog ANSES ruled last week that social media had numerous detrimental effects for adolescents — particularly girls — while not being the sole reason for their declining mental health. Noetel led research published in Psychological Bulletin last year that reviewed more than 100 studies worldwide on the links between screens and the psychological and emotional problems suffered by children and adolescents. The findings suggested a vicious cycle. Excessive screen time — particularly using social media and playing video games — was associated with problems. This distress then drove youngsters to look at their screens even more. However, other researchers are wary of a blanket ban. Ben Singh from the University of Adelaide tracked more than 1,00,000 young Australians over three years for a study published in JAMA Pediatrics. The study found that the young people with the worst wellbeing were those who used social media heavily — more than two hours a day — or not at all. It was teens who used social networks moderately that fared the best. ‘The findings suggest that both excessive restriction and excessive use can be problematic,’ Singh said. Again, girls suffered the most from excessive use. Being entirely deprived of social media was found to be most detrimental for boys in their later teens. French psychiatrist Serge Tisseron is among those who have long warned about the huge threat that screens pose to health. ‘Social media is appallingly toxic,’ he said. But he feared a ban would easily be overcome by tech-savvy teens, at the same time absolving parents of responsibility. ‘In recent years, the debate has become extremely polarised between an outright ban or nothing at all,’ he said, calling for regulation that walks a finer line. Another option could be to wait and see how the Australian experiment pans out. ‘Within a year, we should know much more about how effective the Australian social media ban has been and whether it led to any unintended consequences,’ Cambridge University researcher Amy Orben said. Last week, Australia’s online safety watchdog said that tech companies have already blocked 4.7 million accounts for under 16s.

{"title": "New Age | Prince Harry lawyer claims ‘systematic’ UK newspaper group wrongdoing", "body": "A UK newspaper group accused of phone hacking and hiring private investigators ‘knew they had skeletons in their closet’, a lawyer for Prince Harry said Monday as the trial opened in his joint High Court claim. Harry, who returned to London to sit in court for the opening proceedings, is suing Associated Newspapers Ltd, the publisher of the Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday, over alleged illegal information gathering. The last unresolved case brought by the royal against several UK newspaper publishers, it involves six other high-profile figures, including pop icon Elton John and his husband David Furnish, and actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost. They claim the tabloids illegally intercepted voicemail messages, listened into phone calls and deceptively obtained private information like phone bills and medical records from at least 1993 to, in some instances, 2018. They allege ANL used private investigators implicated in other phone hacking lawsuits for the ‘unlawful information gathering acts’ to feed the papers’ stories. ANL has consistently denied the claims, calling them ‘lurid’ and ‘preposterous’. ‘We will demonstrate that far from being preposterous, there was clear and systematic use of unlawful gathering of information at both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday,’ the claimants’ lawyer David Sherborne said in his opening statement. He added ANL ‘knew they had skeletons in their closet’ and that its ‘emphatic denials were not true’ given the wrongdoing ‘involved journalists from both the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday and every significant editorial desk’. It is the third and final case brought against a British newspaper publisher by Harry, who has called it his ‘mission’ to take on the tabloids ‘for the greater good’. King Charles III’s younger son has long blamed the media for the death of his mother Princess Diana, killed in a Paris car crash in 1997 while trying to shake off the paparazzi. The 41-year-old — dressed Monday in a navy blue suit and a matching tie — is set to attend several of the anticipated nine-week trial’s opening days, before giving evidence Thursday. He made history in 2023 by becoming the first senior British royal to take the stand for more than a century, when he testified as part of his successful claim against Mirror Group Newspapers. It resulted in a December 2023 High Court ruling that Harry had been a victim of phone hacking by MGN journalists and awarded him £140,600 ($179,600) in damages. Last year, he also settled in his court action against Murdoch’s UK tabloid publisher, which agreed to pay him ‘substantial damages’ after admitting intruding into his private life, including by hacking his phone. The ANL case will see Hurley also give evidence later in January, followed by John and Furnish in early February. Hurley and Frost were in court Monday to see the trial begin. In legal submissions, their lawyers claimed ANL hired more than a dozen private investigators over the years in focus to conduct unlawful vehicle checks, access flight information such as seat numbers and bank details. They alleged the investigators would impersonate individuals to obtain information, in a practice known as blagging. They also claim ANL had covered up its use of private investigators through the ‘mass destruction’ of records. ANL lawyer Antony White countered in written submissions that ‘editors, desk heads and journalists’ are ‘lining up to reject the claimants’ allegations of habitual and widespread phone hacking, phone tapping and blagging within the organisation’. But the submissions do acknowledge some use, ‘where appropriate’, of ‘third party investigators to obtain information prior to April 2007 when their use was largely banned’. Harry’s visit is a rare return to Britain for the prince, also known as the Duke of Sussex, who stepped back from royal duties in 2020 and relocated eventually to California with wife Meghan, where they live with their two children. During his last UK visit in September, Harry met with the king seeking to start to repair a bitter family rift. But UK media have said there are no plans for Harry to see his father during this visit.

{"title": "New Age | Trump admin orders 1,500 troops to prepare for possible Minnesota deployment", "body": "The Pentagon has ordered 1,500 US soldiers to prepare for a possible deployment to a state roiled by unrest over an immigration crackdown, US media reported Sunday. The reported preparations come days after president Donald Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which enables use of the military to suppress ‘armed rebellion’ or ‘domestic violence’ — although a day later he said there was no immediate need for it. The troop deployment plans were first reported by the ABC. The news network cited two unnamed US defence officials as saying 1,500 active-duty Army paratroopers based in Alaska have been put on alert, but the president has not made a final decision on the deployment. The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment on Sunday. The Insurrection Act was last invoked in the United States more than 30 years ago, and any move by the federal government to deploy the military would inflame the standoff between the White House and local authorities in Minnesota. Crowds of protesters have clashed with immigration officers in the midwestern state’s main city of Minneapolis, particularly since the fatal shooting of a US woman by a federal agent on January 7. On Saturday, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety said that at the direction of Governor Tim Walz the state’s national guard has been mobilised to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies. As governor, Walz has the authority to deploy the state’s US military reserve during emergencies. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey on Sunday described the 3,000 federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and border control waging Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration as an ‘occupying force that has quite literally invaded our city.’ He told CBS’s ‘Face the Nation’ that the federal agents outnumbered the 600-strong city police force by five to one. He also voiced concern about reports of 1,500 federal troops readying to join them. ‘This is not about safety. What this is about is coming into our city by the thousands and terrorising people simply because they’re Latino or Somali, and yeah, people in Minneapolis are speaking up,’ Frey said. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that the crackdown would continue ‘until we are sure that all the dangerous people are picked up, brought to justice and then deported back to their home countries.’ The Pentagon deployed some 700 US Marines in Los Angeles in June and July in response to angry protests over aggressive immigration enforcement operations underway there. Trump also threatened at that time to invoke the Insurrection Act, but ultimately did not, and the soldiers’ role was limited to guarding two federal properties in the greater Los Angeles area.

{"title": "New Age | China’s birth rate falls to lowest on record", "body": "China’s birth rate plunged last year to its lowest level on record, official data showed on Monday, as its population shrank for a fourth straight year despite efforts to curb the decline. It is now threatened with a demographic crisis after its birth rate halved over the past decade, despite the end of the restrictive ‘one-child’ policy. There were just 7.92 million births recorded last year, Chinese officials said on Monday, a rate of 5.63 births per thousand people. It was the lowest birth rate since National Bureau of Statistics records began in 1949 — the year Communist leader Mao Zedong declared the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The United Nations has predicted that China’s population could fall from around 1.4 billion today to 800 million by 2100, even though it has taken measures to boost fertility rates. Births fell by 1.62 million in 2025, a drop of 17 per cent year-on-year, NBS data showed. China’s population also fell by 3.39 million people last year compared to 2024, extending the annual decline that began in 2022. The government has scrambled to boost marriage and fertility rates, offering childcare subsidies and taxing condoms as it grapples with a rapidly ageing population. China also recorded 11.31 million deaths in 2025, a mortality rate of 8.04 per thousand — leading to a population decline of 2.41 per thousand, NBS data showed. Marriage rates are also at record low, with many young Chinese couples put off from having babies by high child-rearing costs and career concerns. Many couples born during China’s family planning period — each only children — are now grappling with the responsibility of raising children while caring for two sets of ageing parents. Authorities have attempted to address the flagging birth rate with a raft of measures intended to promote having children. A nationwide childcare subsidy policy, which took effect on January 1, offers parents the equivalent of around $500 annually per child under the age of three. Authorities also waived fees for public kindergartens beginning last fall. And consumers must now pay a 13 per cent value-added tax for contraception, including condoms, after Beijing removed exemptions from January 1. Despite government efforts to reverse the trend, China ranked among the top 10 countries with the lowest birth rates in 2023, according to World Bank data, just after Japan. Young Chinese have largely shrugged off these measures, saying they are not enough to address the problem. The jobless rate for people aged between 16 and 24 reached 18.9 per cent in August, reflecting a tough market. Many who have jobs work long hours under a gruelling ‘996’ culture — 9:00am to 9:00pm, six days a week. Overall, China has struggled to maintain a strong economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Officials reported on Monday that the economy grew five per cent in 2025, meeting an official target. However, economists warned that growth was largely driven by strong exports, masking sluggish consumption at home.

The deceased, Abdul Motaleb, a deputy assistant director of RAB-7, joined the RAB on deputation from the Border Guard Bangladesh, said RAB-7 senior assistant director for media, ARM Mozaffar Hossain. Mozaffar said that a RAB-7 team came under attack while conducting a drive in the Jangal Salimpur area at about 6:00pm. Four RAB members were seriously injured in the attack. They were rushed to Chattogram Medical College Hospital, where doctors declared Motaleb dead. Three other injured RAB members, lance nayek Imam, nayek Arif and constable Rifat, are now undergoing treatment in the Chattogram Combined Military Hospital, he said. According to RAB-7, 43 RAB members led by major Jalis Mahmud Khan took part in the operation. Sitakunda police station sub-inspector Jafar Ahmed Bhuiyan said that the police, on hearing the news, rushed to the spot and senior officials were working to bring the situation under control. Additional members of the law enforcement agencies were deployed in the area, he added. The administration had faced attacks multiple times in the past while carrying out drives in the Jangal Salimpur area to stop hill cutting and to evict illegal occupants. On September 14, 2023, at least 20 people, including an executive magistrate of the Chattogram district administration, Sitakunda police station’s officer-in-charge and police personnel, were injured when they were attacked on their way back after an eviction drive. Similar attacks were carried out on the officials of the police, RAB, and Department of Environment in the area several times in 2022.

{"title": "New Age | What Zaima chose to examine", "body": "POLITICAL speeches usually arrive with expectations already fixed. Either they rehearse loyalty, perform outrage or attempt to establish authority through lineage and certainty. Zaima Rahman’s first policy-level speech did none of them. That alone made it noteworthy. But what made it politically interesting was not simply what she said, but what she chose to foreground and what she deliberately left unresolved. Speaking at a Dhaka Forum discussion on women’s empowerment, Zaima Rahman did not present herself as a reformer with ready answers. Nor did she attempt to translate her family legacy into political entitlement. Instead, she framed her intervention as provisional, incomplete and rooted in observation rather than command. In a political culture that rewards assertion over inquiry, this positioning deserves scrutiny as much as appreciation. Her return home after 17 years was inevitably symbolic. Any public appearance by the daughter of Tarique Rahman and the granddaughter of Khaleda Zia and Ziaur Rahman carries political weight regardless of intent. Yet, her speech resisted the temptation to convert that symbolism into immediacy. She did not announce arrival as destiny. She described it as uncertainty. The core argument of her address revolved around a deceptively simple proposition: women’s empowerment cannot be understood solely through policies, institutions or headline achievements. It must be examined through daily arrangements of labour, care, expectation and silence. This is not an unfamiliar argument to feminist scholarship, but it remains underrepresented in mainstream political discourse, particularly when voiced from within elite political families. Zaima placed the home at the centre of her analysis. Not the home as a sentimental space, but as a site where inequality is normalised before it becomes structural. Long before women encounter laws or labour markets, she argued, they encounter expectations. Who adjusts. Who compromises. Who carries responsibility without recognition. In this sense, empowerment becomes less about access and more about redistribution. Her emphasis on unpaid care work was the most substantive policy-adjacent element of the speech. Citing data that shows women performing the vast majority of domestic and care labour, she made a direct link between invisible work and limited economic participation. The argument was clear: women do not exit public life because they are unwilling or incapable but because the system quietly assumes they will absorb the cost of everything else. This framing matters because it challenges a comfortable narrative that Bangladesh has grown fond of. The narrative celebrates progress through participation statistics while avoiding deep questions about sustainability. Women are educated, yes. Women work, yes. But under what conditions, for how long and at what personal cost are these achievements maintained? Zaima was careful about not romanticising endurance. In doing so, she unsettled one of the most persistent tropes surrounding women. Resilience, she suggested, has become a substitute for justice. Women are praised for managing impossibly uneven burdens while the structures that create those burdens remain largely untouched. This is a subtle but pointed critique of both policy complacency and social habit. At the same time, her speech did not adopt a confrontational feminist register. It did not frame gender inequality as a conflict between women and men, nor did it rely on moral accusation. Instead, it redistributed responsibility. Men were addressed not as abstract obstacles, but as participants whose everyday choices shape outcomes more decisively than slogans or declarations. Her focus on fathers was especially deliberate. Rather than appealing to ideological alignment, she appealed to modelling. What children observe, she argued, becomes expectations. Respect demonstrated consistently matters more than rhetoric delivered occasionally. This argument is sociological rather than emotive and it places the burden of change within intimate, often unexamined spaces. The speech also addressed the hostile environment that women face in public life, particularly through online harassment and disproportionate scrutiny. This was not presented as a side issue, but as a mechanism of exclusion. When public participation carries relentless personal cost, withdrawal becomes rational rather than cowardly. This insight is crucial in a political environment where women’s under-representation is often blamed on lack of ambition rather than structural hostility. Yet, it is important to note what Zaima did not do. She did not outline policy pathways for addressing unpaid labour. She did not propose institutional reform. She did not articulate how recognition would translate into redistribution. This absence can be read in two ways. Either as caution, or as the limits of a speech that prioritised diagnosis over prescription. Her extensive references to family legacy occupy an ambiguous space. On the one hand, they humanised her argument, grounding abstract concepts in lived experience. On the other, they underscore the distance between environments where empowerment is normalised and those where it must be negotiated constantly. Zaima acknowledged this gap directly, describing her upbringing as privileged and her early understanding of society as incomplete. This acknowledgement was important, but it also raises a larger question. Awareness of privilege is not the same as political alignment with those excluded by it. Recognition is a starting point, not an endpoint. Whether Zaima’s analysis eventually translates into advocacy that challenges entrenched interests, including within elite political and economic structures, remains an open question. Her speech avoided populist gestures and resisted emotional escalation. That restraint may limit its immediate appeal in a highly polarised political environment. But it also signals a potential departure from the inherited style of political communication, which often prioritises mobilisation over reflection. There is, however, a risk embedded in this approach. Reflection without friction can remain safely abstract. Naming inequality without confronting power can leave structures intact. The unpaid labour that women perform is not sustained by mindset alone, but by economic design, labour market and policy choices that benefit from women’s unpaid contributions. Addressing this requires confrontation, not only consensus. Zaima’s return to public life, thus, sits at a crossing of expectations and ambiguity. She enters politics not as an outsider, but not yet as an actor willing to claim authority. Her first speech positioned her as an observer who speaks cautiously, critically and with an evident desire to avoid overstatement. In a political moment saturated with certainty, this may feel refreshing. It may also feel insufficient. Bangladesh today faces pressure that leaves little room for symbolic engagement. Economic transition, climate vulnerability, demographic change and political fatigue all demand decisions that redistribute risk and responsibility. Women already carry a disproportionate share of that burden. Recognising this reality is necessary. Acting on it is harder. Zaima’s speech did not promise action. It clarified the cost of inaction. That distinction is important. Whether her voice will remain analytical or evolve into political commitment will determine whether this intervention becomes a footnote or a foundation. For now, her address stands as a careful entry into a public conversation that Bangladesh often conducts too loudly and too superficially. It replaced certainty with scrutiny and slogans with discomfort. That is not transformation. But it is a prerequisite for it. Whether the country and its politics are prepared to move beyond listening remains to be seen.

{"title": "New Age | Adaptive skills", "body": "EVERYWHERE we turn, there is talk of the ‘skills gap’ and the ‘workforce of the future.’ But beyond the slogans lies a pressing question: what are the real skills that will move our nation forward? The world of work is changing faster than ever before. The fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) has already introduced artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced automation — technologies that are transforming industries at breakneck speed. On the horizon, Industry 5.0 is emerging, emphasising human-centric, sustainable and resilient systems. In such a landscape, adaptability is no longer just an advantage, it is the key to survival and progress. Technical expertise alone is no longer enough. Adaptive skills — ‘the skills for learning new skills’ — are what enable people to grow and thrive in a world of constant change. They have become the defining requirement of our time. Why now? The first three industrial revolutions valued specialised expertise and mastery of routines, as work was largely predictable and stable. Today, however, rapid disruptions — climate change, global health crises and supply chain shocks — are interconnected, requiring solutions that cross traditional boundaries. Adaptive skills equip professionals to understand systems as a whole, integrate knowledge across fields and craft innovative responses. Traditionally, education emphasised hard skills (technical, domain-specific knowledge) and soft skills (communication, teamwork, leadership). Both remain important, but they are no longer sufficient. With technology evolving at an unprecedented pace, workers cannot rely solely on what they already know. Adaptive skills allow individuals to pivot to new tools, technologies and processes without fear of obsolescence. These skills are not static; they involve learning, unlearning and relearning throughout life. They include flexibility, critical thinking, creativity, complex problem-solving, resilience, collaboration, entrepreneurial thinking, emotional intelligence and above all, a commitment to lifelong learning. Unlike hard skills, which quickly become outdated, adaptive skills ensure that individuals remain relevant and capable in dynamic environments. Industry 5.0 envisions humans working alongside intelligent machines. Here, adaptive skills will enable workers to harness automation and AI while preserving uniquely human strengths such as empathy, ethical judgment and creativity. For Bangladesh, this is not an abstract debate, it is an urgent reality. Automation is already reshaping the ready-made garments sector, data analytics is transforming agriculture and digital platforms are revolutionising services. The ground beneath our economy is shifting. A workforce rich in adaptive skills will be in highest demand, driving growth and attracting investment. Yet our education system, still deeply rooted in rote memorisation and rigid exam-based structures, remains out of sync with this future. To close this gap, universities and training institutions must rethink their approach. They should embrace interdisciplinary learning across science, technology, humanities and social sciences; promote project-based and experiential learning; design flexible lifelong learning pathways; and embed digital literacy, creativity and ethical reasoning into every discipline. But education alone cannot carry the burden. Governments must align policies with future skill needs. Industries must invest in their workforce. And individuals must take ownership of their own growth. Only through collaboration among academia, industry, policymakers and workers can we build an ecosystem of adaptability. As Bangladesh stands at the crossroads of Industry 4.0 and the emerging Industry 5.0, adaptive skills are the bridge between technological progress and human development. They will determine how effectively we harness innovation, how competitive our industries remain and how resiliently our people build meaningful careers. Without adaptive skills, Bangladesh risks being left behind. With them, we can step confidently into the future.

{"title": "New Age | Triangles, tensions and tactical trade-offs", "body": "FOR over a decade, global geopolitics has shifted from American unipolarity to a more complex multipolar world, characterised by a tripartite power dynamic involving the US, China, and Russia. This evolution, termed strategic triangularism, involves competitive, cooperative, and confrontational interactions among these powers that shape international order. While previously theoretical, this triangular world order is becoming more evident as the US wields its hegemonic authority, China expands its global influence, and Russia strengthens its strategic presence in Eurasia and the Middle East. These trends indicate a transition from a unipolar world to a more contested, multipolar landscape. Scholars argue that US power has often been weaponised in ways that deepen global instability — from prolonged military engagements to unilateral sanctions and diplomatic coercion that undermine cooperative international frameworks. Meanwhile, China’s rise over the same period has been marked by extraordinary economic growth, expansive trade networks like the Belt and Road Initiative, and assertive regional policies that challenge US dominance in Asia and beyond. Russia, for its part, having suffered a post-Soviet contraction in influence, has in recent years reasserted its military and geopolitical weight, leveraging energy resources, strategic alignments, and military power to complicate Western policies and revitalise its standing as a global actor. Collectively, the interactions among these three powers do not merely generate competition; they are catalysing a new world order in which power is negotiated within an uneven but persistent triangle of influence and rivalry. In this evolving triangular order, the United States has traditionally functioned as a system-shaping power. However, under Donald Trump, this dominance has become more overt and imperial, extending beyond traditional alliances. While still relying on NATO and longstanding partnerships, recent years have seen a shift toward coercive leadership, particularly amid increased pressure on European allies to increase defence spending, expand trade, and assert greater strategic autonomy. This approach has blurred the line between alliance management and domination, treating partners as instruments of US dominance rather than equal stakeholders. The renewed US interest in Greenland reflects a 19th-century geopolitical instinct resurfacing today. Scholarly analyses suggest this behaviour reinforces perceptions of US unilateralism and accelerates hedging among allies, many of whom are engaging China economically and accommodating Russia. Consequently, Washington’s actions paradoxically contribute to the emergence of a tripartite world order, defined by recalibrated loyalties and strategic calculations of allies. China, for its part, leverages economic statecraft, investment networks across Africa, Latin America, and Central Asia, and a spectrum of ‘strategic partners’ that stop short of formal military pacts but create dependency and diplomatic alignment, as highlighted in analyses of Beijing’s global strategy. Russia — while economically constrained — has deepened security and energy ties with Beijing and cultivated alliances with Tehran, Minsk, and other states disaffected by Western policy, using these relationships to sustain its influence and disrupt Western cohesion. These interconnected alliances do not form rigid blocs akin to the Cold War but rather reflect a flexible, contested balance of influence in which allies help define each pole’s strategic capacity and the broader shape of the international order. Each of the three powers defines the triangular world order through distinct strategic lenses shaped by historical experience, perceptions of power, and geopolitical interests. From the American perspective, the triangle is primarily considered a structure of strategic competition and containment, in which the United States must defend its global primacy against a rising China and a resurgent Russia. China views the triangular order as both a consequence and an opportunity of its ascendance, interpreting US actions as attempts to preserve an outdated unipolar system and justifying China’s pursuit of an alternative order emphasising multipolarity, development cooperation, and regional leadership, championing ‘win-win cooperation’ and global governance reform. Russia’s view is shaped by its resurgence in military and energy domains and a longstanding commitment to multipolarity that opposes US hegemony; Moscow sees the triangular order as a chance to reassert great-power status, resist Western encroachment (notably NATO expansion), and leverage its strategic partnership with China to balance American power without subsuming its autonomy. Collectively, these differing perspectives underscore that the triangle is not a symmetrical axis of united purpose but a dynamic, contested arena in which each power’s worldview and strategic priorities continually redefine what global order means to them. The new world order is increasingly taking shape as a multipolar, fragmented system in which power is distributed among the United States, China, and Russia. Under this emerging architecture, the US envisions a bloc-orientated order driven by America First policies, economic and geopolitical competition, and a recalibration of alliances — essentially a return to a bloc logic reminiscent of the Cold War but with three rival poles rather than two. Trump’s administration has reinforced this shift by reviving Monroe Doctrine-like rhetoric and pressing for US dominance in the Western Hemisphere and the Indo-Pacific, while simultaneously challenging traditional institutions and alliances, underscoring a transactional, assertive US posture that reshapes old commitments and pressures partners to align more closely with American strategic interests. Meanwhile, China and Russia are promoting multipolarity, inclusive governance, and alternatives to US-centric systems through institutions like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and BRICS, appealing especially to states dissatisfied with Western dominance. For the Global South, this means countries are no longer compelled to choose strictly between East and West but can leverage competition among great powers for infrastructure, investment, and diplomatic support — yet they also face heightened pressures to navigate a complex field of influence that can amplify dependency or domestic vulnerabilities. For a country like Bangladesh, strategically positioned in the Indo-Pacific and a participant in major regional frameworks, the tripolar order presents opportunities for diversified partnerships, development financing, and geopolitical relevance, but also risks entanglement in great-power rivalries that could complicate its autonomy and economic priorities in areas such as trade, security cooperation, and infrastructure investment. Drawing on recent scholarly debates on tripartite ordering and the erosion of the post-1945 system, the emerging triangular world order is likely to be less rule-bound and more power-negotiated, with profound consequences for the Global South. Analysts argue that a US–China–Russia triangle does not amount to a stable concert of powers but rather an uneven, competitive geometry in which norms are subordinated to interests and smaller states face intensified pressure to align, hedge, or absorb spillover shocks. In the Global South, this environment reduces the protective value of multilateralism while increasing exposure to sanctions, proxy rivalries, and economic coercion. Bangladesh exemplifies this dilemma: strategically located, economically integrated, and diplomatically active, yet structurally vulnerable to great-power competition in trade, security, climate finance, and humanitarian crises. The triangular order thus magnifies both opportunity and risk — offering leverage through diversification, while simultaneously narrowing the margin for error in foreign-policy choices. The engagement strategies of the US, Russia, and China towards the Global South differ significantly. The United States remains the most coercive actor, using sanctions, conditional aid, and diplomatic pressure, prioritising a transactional approach over developmental support. In contrast, Russia acts as a more insulated power, engaging selectively through energy and arms without pushing for deep political changes in partner states. China has become a key partner for the Global South, offering infrastructure financing and development cooperation via initiatives like the Belt and Road, emphasising sovereignty and non-interference, which appeals to countries wary of Western conditionality. These distinct approaches create a hierarchy of risks and opportunities, prompting Global South states to navigate their relationships based on interests rather than ideology. An emerging consensus in scholarship holds that the Global South must move beyond episodic hedging toward a deliberate, strategically disciplined multialignment that engages all three poles without sliding into dependency on any single power. For Bangladesh, this is not an abstract prescription but an immediate strategic necessity. Dhaka already balances US market access and security engagement, Chinese infrastructure financing and industrial investment, and Russian cooperation in energy and defence — most visibly in projects such as the Rooppur Nuclear Power Plant, participation in the Belt and Road Initiative, and continued access to Western export markets. The challenge now is to convert this pragmatic balancing into a more institutionalised strategy — deepening economic and diplomatic ties across South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East; strengthening regional mechanisms within BIMSTEC, the Indian Ocean Rim Association, and UN peacekeeping networks; and diversifying sources of finance, technology, and security cooperation to reduce exposure to sanctions pressure or geopolitical coercion. Equally critical is closer coordination with similarly positioned states — such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Kenya — to amplify collective bargaining power on issues ranging from climate finance and labour migration to supply-chain resilience. Cooperation among the Global South is no longer a matter of ideological solidarity but of strategic survival. In a world where power increasingly overrides principle, Bangladesh’s long-term autonomy will depend not on choosing sides, but on calibrated multialignment anchored in robust South–South collaboration and sustained national resilience.

{"title": "New Age | Failing NBFIs expose regulatory failure", "body": "THE latest Bangladesh Bank data revealing that 37.11 per cent of loans in non-bank financial institutions have turned defaulted should alarm policymakers. With toxic loans increasing steadily quarter after quarter, with Tk 1,867 crore in toxic loans having increased in a quarter to Tk 29,408 crore in September 2025, the sector has slipped further into dysfunction. The central bank’s decision to shut down nine NBFIs that failed to return depositors’ money and collapsed under the weight of non-performing loans underscores the gravity of the crisis. Yet this action, while necessary, comes painfully late. For years, depositors, including many retirees, small traders and middle-class families, have watched their life savings remain trapped while they staged protests in front of company offices, demanding justice. Experts have pointed to irregularities, poor governance and weakened supervision as the main drivers of this collapse. The central bank data reveal that 20 out of 35 NBFIs now have default loan ratios exceeding 50 per cent and by the end of 2024, the sector had accumulated combined losses of Tk 3,555 crore, nearly double the previous year’s figure. The figures not only indicate mismanagement but also point to a systemic oversight and accountability failures. The Financial Stability Report 2024 had already warned that only nine of the 35 NBFIs could be considered sound while 21 were categorised as weak. The report should have prompted decisive intervention long ago. Instead, the regulatory agency largely relied on show-cause notices and accepted turnaround plans that proved ineffective or insincere. Of the 20 institutions asked to explain why their licences should not be revoked, only 11 submitted plans and nine failed to give satisfactory responses. This prolonged tolerance has eroded public trust not only in NBFIs but in the financial system. NBFIs are meant to complement banks by financing sectors such as housing, infrastructure and small and medium enterprises, areas critical to inclusive economic growth, and, in many countries, they serve as engines of financial innovation by diversifying investment. They have, however, been hollowed out by irregular lending, insider abuse and regulatory capture, turning what should have been a pillar of development into a burden on the economy. Political patronage and impunity have for long shielded powerful defaulters and compromised regulators alike. Without breaking this nexus, reforms will remain cosmetic. Restoring trust will be difficult, but it is not impossible if there is will. Piecemeal measures are unlikely to discipline the sector. What is now required is a comprehensive overhaul of the regulatory, governance and accountability framework. Given the size and importance of the NBFI sector, the authorities must regulate it effectively, ensuring that the institutions serve their intended purpose as facilitators of productive investment rather than as vehicles for plunder.

{"title": "New Age | Election Commission must clear the air", "body": "THE tussle between the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, with allegations of partiality levelled against the Election Commission with allusions made to each other, remains a concern, with only three weeks to the national elections and a referendum scheduled for February 12. The situation warrants that the Election Commission should look into the issues and make statements in clear terms on the allegations against it alluded to by the political parties. Whilst the Bangladesh Nationalist Party met the Election Commission on January 18 and alleged partiality against the commission, the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami met the chief adviser to the interim government the same day and demanded a level playing field during the elections. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party delegation, led by the party’s secretary general, has registered complaints with the commission against ‘a certain political party’ and demanded resolution; the Jamaat-e-Islami delegation, led by the party’s amir, has discussed ‘some dubious scenarios’ and said that the irresolution of the issues would show that the commission is either weak or biased towards ‘a certain political party.’ The Bangladesh Nationalist Party has alleged that a party was bringing voters on a large scale before the elections into the Dhaka city constituencies from various outlying areas, wanting to know from the commission details such as the number of constituency-wide voters newly registered and the areas the new voters are from. The BNP secretary general has also questioned the design of the postal ballots for expatriate voters and alleged that they have been designed in a way that could favour the electoral symbol of ‘scales’, demanding that they should be changed. He has also said that the party he alluded to has collected copies of the national identity cards and mobile financial service numbers of voters in a door-to-door campaign, urging steps against the move. He has talked about adherence to the electoral code of conduct and a breach by the party he has alluded to. Jamaat-e-Islami has alleged partiality against the commission, saying that it had delivered differing decisions in similar cases of declaring nomination papers valid or rejected. The party has said that loan default and dual citizenship are the main grounds considered in deciding nomination, but the decisions of the commission have differed in similar cases. The party has also alleged that leaders of a certain political party have mounted pressure on the commission to declare nominations valid that should have been rejected because of irregularities. Both the political parties say that the commission should ensure a level playing field, not bow to the pressure of any of the parties and act on the breach of the electoral code without exception. The Election Commission should, in such a situation, look into the issues and make clear statements on the allegations in the interests of its impartiality.

{"title": "New Age | US warns Bangladeshi applicants against advance visa bond payments", "body": "The US Embassy on Monday cautioned Bangladeshi visa applicants against paying any visa bond before interviews, warning that advance payments neither guarantee visa approval nor protect applicants from fraud or scams. In a statement posted on its verified Facebook page today, the embassy said paying a bond in advance does not ensure a visa and noted that third-party websites offering such services may be fraudulent. ‘Paying early does not guarantee you a visa, and third-party sites can be scams,’ the embassy said, adding that any payment made before a visa interview is non-refundable. It noted that a bond would be returned only if the visa holder fully complies with its terms. The warning comes ahead of a new US policy set to take effect on January 21, under which Bangladeshi citizens approved for B1/B2 (business or tourist) visas will be required to post a bond up to $15,000. The requirement will not apply to holders of valid B1/B2 visas issued before that date. Earlier this month, the administration of US President Donald Trump added 25 more countries, including Bangladesh, to a list of nations whose citizens may be required to post entry bonds, Reuters reported on January 6, citing the US State Department website. According to the website, eligible B1/B2 visa applicants from the listed countries may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000, with the amount determined during the visa interview. Applicants must agree to the bond conditions and make payments exclusively through the US Treasury Department’s official online platform, Pay.gov, the state department said. The expanded list now covers 38 countries, mostly from Africa, Latin America and South Asia. US authorities said the bond requirement aims to deter visitors from overstaying visas issued for tourism or business purposes.

Cast your vote for ‘Yes,’ encourage everyone you know to do the same, and bring them to the polling stations. Change the country,’ he said. Yunus made the call in a televised message amid criticisms from different quarters over seeking the ‘Yes’ vote in the referendum by the government advisers and officials. ‘I urge all of you to take part in the upcoming referendum. Vote for ‘Yes’ to build the state according to your expectations,’ said Yunus. He said that the ‘July uprising’ was an extraordinary achievement in the nation’s history, creating an opportunity to establish democracy, justice, and human rights in the life of the nation. Noting that a number of reforms have already been undertaken in the spirit of July uprising, he said that a July Charter had been formulated on the basis of consensus among all political parties of the country to carry out deeper and far-reaching reforms. ‘Your consent is required to implement the July Charter, ‘he said, adding that a referendum was therefore being organised for this purpose. ‘Take part in the referendum and give your consent to the charter,’ he added. Noting that the referendum will be held on the same day as the Jatiya Sangsad election, on February 12, he said, ‘If you vote for ‘Yes’ in the referendum, Bangladesh will be free from discrimination, exploitation, and oppression.’ Yunus said that a ‘Yes’ vote in the referendum would mean that the government and the opposition would work together to form a caretaker government and an Election Commission. A ‘Yes’ vote also means that the government will not be able to amend the constitution at will while the consent of the people will be required for any important changes to the constitution. ‘It also provides that the deputy speaker and the chairpersons of key parliamentary committees will be elected from the opposition party,’ he said. He said that a person would not be able to serve as prime minister for more than 10 years and the judiciary would function independently. ‘The representation of women in the Jatiya Sangsad will increase while an upper house will be formed in parliament to maintain a balance of power.’ Yunus said, ‘A ‘Yes’ vote means that people’s fundamental rights will be better protected, the state language, Bangla, will be constitutionally recognised, along with the languages of other ethnic groups.’ ‘The president will not be able to pardon convicted criminals at will while all power will not be concentrated in the hands of the prime minister,’ he explained.

The Bangladesh Cricket Board is refusing to play in India, citing security concerns, and have asked the governing International Cricket Council to shift their matches to co-hosts Sri Lanka. The BCB held talks in Dhaka at the weekend with ICC officials over the impasse, but no agreement was reached. ‘During the discussions, the BCB reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh's matches to Sri Lanka,’ a BCB statement said. The ICC have not officially commented, but website Cricinfo and other Indian media reported on Monday that the deadline of Wednesday had been set for Dhaka to make a decision. ICC sources have told AFP that Bangladesh could be replaced by Scotland, who are the highest-ranked team who did not qualify for the World Cup. The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England's Group C and scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai. One suggestion was for Bangladesh to swap with Group B's Ireland, whose matches are in Sri Lanka. ‘Among other points, the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed,’ said the BCB. Pakistan will play all their matches in Colombo under an ICC agreement with India to play at neutral venues in global or regional tournaments. The row erupted on January 3, when the IPL's Kolkata Knight Riders were ordered by India's cricket board to drop Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, sparking fury in Dhaka. Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi. India's foreign ministry last month condemned what it called ‘unremitting hostility against minorities’ in Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Bangladesh's interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.

{"title": "New Age | HC suspends SUST students’ union polls for four weeks", "body": "The High Court on Monday postponed student union elections at the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology for four weeks. The polls at the university in Sylhet city were supposed to be held today. Later on the day, the university authority filed a petition seeking permission to appeal against the High Court decision. Protesting at the postponement of the polls scheduled for January 20, a section of SUST students later on the day confined the vice-chancellor and pro-vice-chancellor inside the Administrative Building-1, New Age staff correspondent in Sylhet reported. A High Court bench of Justice Fahmida Quader and Justice Md Ashif Hasan passed the order after hearing a writ petition filed by Md Mominur Rashid Shuvo and Md Rakibul Hasan Ratan, both independent candidates vying for the vice-president post in the polls. They challenged the legality of the election commission decision. The court also issued a rule asking the university’s election commission to explain why the decision to allow the polls should not be declared illegal. Senior lawyer Ruhul Quddus Kazal and Rashna Imam appeared for the petitioners. Barrister Rashna told journalists after the HC decision had been passed that the writ petitioners said that holding the SUCSU polls would not be legal on January 20 since Bangladesh Election Commission earlier issued instructions to suspend all types of elections before the National elections scheduled for February 12. ‘The SUCSU elections will not be held tomorrow. But the elections may be held any day after next four weeks,’ she added. Additional attorney general Aneek R Hoque, deputy attorney general Shofiqur Rahman and assistant attorney general Mohiuddin Hanif represented the state, while Mohammad Hossain appeared for the SUST election commission. Immediately after the news of postponing the SUCSU polls had broken, several hundred students, including the supporters of Jamaat-e-Islami-backed student organisation Islami Chhatra Shibir, launched demonstrations at around 2:30pm, blocking Sylhet-Sunamganj road in front of the university’s main entrance at Akhalia in the city in the afternoon. Later at around 5:00pm, they returned to the campus and locked the entrance of the administrative building keeping vice-chancellor Professor AM Sarwaruddin Chowdhury and pro-vice-chancellor Professor Sajedul Karim inside the building, students said. The demonstrations were on with the VC and pro-vice-chancellor still confined as of 10:30pm while this report was filed. Demonstrators at night said that if their demand was not met by 9:00am today they would cut the utility connections of the vice-chancellor’s official residence. University proctor Professor Mokhlesur Rahman told New Age in the evening that they were trying to reach a decision after having a directive from the higher authorities to calm the agitating students.

{"title": "New Age | What Sets the Mahindra Bolero Apart from Modern Urban SUVs", "body": "The SUV market today is largely shaped by urban priorities. Many modern SUVs are designed around city driving, focusing on sleek styling, touchscreen-heavy dashboards, and convenience-led features. While this approach suits metropolitan environments, it does not address the needs of all buyers. The Mahindra Bolero occupies a distinct position by deliberately diverging from the urban SUV formula, offering a vehicle built around strength, simplicity, and long-term reliability. Rather than competing with urban SUVs on refinement or digital sophistication, the Bolero stands out by serving use cases where resilience and practicality take precedence over aesthetics. Most urban SUVs follow a crossover-inspired design language, characterised by sloping rooflines, low ground clearance, and car-like proportions, all aimed at enhancing visual appeal. The Mahindra Bolero takes the opposite approach. Its upright stance, boxy silhouette, and squared-off body panels are functional choices designed to maximise interior space, improve visibility, and withstand physical wear. The latest iteration of the Bolero features a bold new grille, fog lamps, and R15 wheels, with select variants offering diamond-cut alloy wheels and the Stealth Black colour for subtle modernisation without altering its utilitarian identity. This design immediately distinguishes the Bolero from urban SUVs that prioritise styling over substance. One of the most important differences between the Mahindra Bolero and modern urban SUVs lies beneath the surface. While most city-focused SUVs use monocoque construction optimised for comfort and efficiency, the Bolero is built on a high-strength, frame-based body. The Bolero’s robust metal bumper and reinforced structure contribute to its ability to handle prolonged stress and uneven terrain. This ladder-frame architecture is better suited to carrying loads, absorbing impacts, and operating consistently in challenging conditions. Urban SUVs, by contrast, are typically designed for smooth tarmac and lighter usage, making the Bolero structurally distinct. Modern urban SUVs often emphasise refined petrol engines, automatic gearboxes, and fuel efficiency figures aimed at city commuting. The Mahindra Bolero instead relies on a mHawk75 diesel engine, producing 55.9 kW of power and 210 Nm of torque, tuned for low-end strength and consistent pulling ability. This torque-focused tuning supports: The inclusion of Micro Hybrid Technology with Engine Start–Stop improves efficiency during idling, but the overall emphasis remains on reliability rather than smoothness or acceleration. This stands in contrast to urban SUVs, where drivability and refinement are often prioritised over durability. Suspension tuning further separates the Bolero from modern urban SUVs. While city-focused SUVs typically employ comfort-oriented setups designed for smooth roads, the Bolero features an independent front suspension with coil springs and a rigid rear leaf spring arrangement. Bolero’s RideFlo advanced ride and handling technology enhances stability, steering confidence, and braking performance. This configuration is designed to absorb rough surfaces and support heavier loads without compromising structural integrity. Urban SUVs, with their softer suspension setups, are typically not engineered for this level of sustained mechanical stress. Inside, the Mahindra Bolero avoids the design trends commonly seen in modern urban SUVs, such as oversized touchscreens and minimal physical controls. Instead, the cabin focuses on durability and functional comfort. The Bolero’s redesigned seats with improved cushioning, leatherette upholstery in higher variants, and practical storage solutions, including built-in bottle holders and utility spaces in door trims. With seating for seven occupants in a 5+2 configuration, the Bolero supports shared travel and family use. Features such as air conditioning, power windows, central locking, and remote key access provide everyday convenience without relying on fragile or overly complex interfaces. This approach contrasts with urban SUVs, where interior design often prioritises visual appeal over long-term durability. Technology in the Mahindra Bolero is intentionally restrained. Instead of advanced infotainment systems and connected features, the Bolero features essential components that support daily use. The SUV offers a 17.8 cm touchscreen infotainment system, a digital driver information cluster, steering-mounted audio controls, and a USB-C-type charging port. By limiting technological complexity, the Bolero reduces the risk of long-term electronic issues—an important consideration in environments where service access or usage conditions may be demanding. Modern urban SUVs often rely on driver assistance systems to enhance safety. The Mahindra Bolero takes a different route, focusing on robust fundamentals. The Bolero comes with dual airbags, ABS with Electronic Brake-force Distribution, seatbelt reminders, reverse parking sensors, and an engine immobiliser across variants. Combined with the vehicle’s high-strength frame-based construction, these features provide dependable protection in real-world conditions. This safety philosophy prioritises resilience and braking stability rather than electronic intervention. The Bolero’s physical dimensions further reinforce its separation from urban SUVs: These proportions support stability, interior space, and extended driving range—attributes less emphasised in city-centric SUVs. The Mahindra Bolero stands apart from modern urban SUVs because it is built for a fundamentally different purpose. Through frame-based construction, a torque-oriented diesel engine, durable suspension, and function-first interior design, it serves buyers whose priorities extend beyond city comfort and digital features. In an SUV market increasingly shaped by urban lifestyles, the Bolero represents an alternative philosophy—one where strength, simplicity, and long-term dependability remain central. This clear differentiation is what continues to set the Mahindra Bolero apart.

The sit-in programme rolled into the second consecutive days for pressing their three demands — stopping the manipulation of postal ballots for Bangladeshi expatriates living abroad, cancelling what they described as an unprecedented gazette notification issued by the commission to hold Shahjalal University of Science and Technology students’ union polls before the general election under pressure from a student body of a particular political party, and refraining from partisan activities of the commission under pressure from a specific political party.

Judge Md Zahidul Haque of the tribunal passed the order, rejecting discharge petitions filed by 23 detained accused, including Chinmoy, assistant public prosecutor Md Raihanul Wazed Chowdhury said. The court ordered the prosecution to produce their witnesses in phases from February 2 for recording their testimonies, he said. The charge sheet mentioned Chinmoy as an abettor and instigator in the killing of the lawyer. It said that the other accused carried out the killing in a group on Chinmoy’s instruction and provocation. Police produced Chinmoy and 22 others before the court in the morning amid tight security. To avert any untoward situation, more than 100 members of the police, army and Border Guard Bangladesh were deployed on the court premises. On October 25, 2024, Chinmoy led a large gathering of the Hindu community in Chattogram. On October 31, 2024, a sedition case was filed against 19 people, including Chinmoy, on charges of desecrating the national flag. On November 22, 2024, Chinmoy led another large rally in Rangpur, following which he was arrested at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka on November 25, 2024 in the sedition case. A Chattogram court rejected his bail petition on the following day and sent him to jail. The court’s decision sparked clashes between his followers and the members of the law enforcement agencies on the court premises. At one stage of the clash, lawyer Alif was hacked to death outside the court premises. Several cases were filed against Chinmoy and others following the murder. On April 30, the High Court granted bail to Chinmoy in the sedition case, but the Appellate Division later cancelled the bail. In the murder case, the police on July 1, 2025 filed a charge sheet naming Chinmoy as the prime accused and listing 38 others. During the charge-sheet acceptance hearing, the court rejected the investigation officer’s recommendation to discharge one person, raising the total number of charge-sheeted accused to 39.

{"title": "New Age | People suffer as battery-run rickshaw pullers block road in city", "body": "City dwellers had to suffer immensely as battery-run rickshaw pullers blocked the main road in the capital’s Notun Bazar area for two hours on Monday. They staged the demonstration urging the government to allow them to ply their rickshaws on all city roads and withdraw the three-wheelers designed by the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. Dhaka Metropolitan Police’s Gulshan Division additional deputy commissioner for traffic, Ziaur Rahman, said that about 500 battery-run rickshaw pullers blocked the road in front of Fuji Tower at about 9:45am and left the place after two hours. ‘We have diverted vehicles and the blockade on one of the busiest roads in the city created congestion in other areas and caused immense suffering to the people,’ he added. Battery-run rickshaw, Van, Easybike Sangram Parishad coordinator Khalikuzzaman Lipon said that they wanted battery-run rickshaw to be allowed to ply on all roads, except highways. He demanded service lanes for rickshaws beside highways. ‘We have no objection to the BUET-designed rickshaws. But if a company makes a monopoly with manufacturing these rickshaws, we will not allow it. We want our local talented manufacturers also make rickshaws following the approved design,’ he said. He said that the design should be approved by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority through a policy. Following the ouster of the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League regime on August 5, 2024 amid a student-led mass uprising, the battery-run rickshaws started playing major city roads and highways, defying the government-set rules. The risk of road accidents involving battery-run rickshaws is higher compared to paddle-run rickshaws, revealed a study report published on Sunday. According to the study, 44.45 per cent of the battery-powered rickshaw pullers participating in the study faced serious to very serious accidents, against 29.6 per cent of the participating paddle-run rickshaws. The study, conducted by INNOVISION Consulting in September 2025, also found that the pullers of battery-powered rickshaws were likely to underreport accidents out of fear of regulatory crackdowns.

The directive was issued through a home ministry notification on Sunday. It said that, in line with the announced election schedule, licence holders will be completely prohibited from carrying and displaying firearms until February 15. The restriction, however, will not apply to firearms allocated, under existing policy, for politically important persons and parliamentary candidates and members of law enforcement agencies, the notification said. For candidates, the ban will not apply where a nomination paper has been lawfully submitted to the Election Commission and accepted, or for an armed retainer authorised for the candidate. The ministry warned that violations would face legal action under relevant provisions of the Arms Act, 1878. It also instructed all superintendents of police and other concerned officials to take necessary steps to enforce the order in this regard. Ministry officials said that the submission requirement and temporary restriction on carrying weapons are routine but important measures to maintain law and order during elections and reduce the risk of violence and intimidation. On December 14, the government issued policy guidelines on granting firearms licences and appointing retainers (persons authorised to carry firearms) for politically important individuals and candidates contesting the national election.

{"title": "New Age | At least 19 people killed in Chile wildfires, emergency declared", "body": "Uncontrolled wildfires tore through communities in southern Chile, leaving charred ruins in their wake and at least 19 dead, authorities said, announcing the latest toll on Sunday. More than 50,000 people have been displaced by blazes burning for two days now in the Nuble and Biobio regions about 500 kilometers south of Santiago, fanned by strong winds and hot weather. ‘At 2:30 in the morning, the fire was out of control. There was a whirlwind of fire that consumed the houses in the town below,’ Matias Cid, a 25-year-old student in Penco, told AFP. ‘We had to leave with the shirts on our back. If we had stayed another 20 minutes we would have burned to death,’ he said. Video of the aftermath shows a bleak, empty cityscape of charred homes and burned-out pick-up trucks and cars. Most of the fatalities from the wildfires in the region have so far been in Penco, Mayor Rodrigo Vera said. In neighboring Lirquen, a small port town of about 20,000, the scene was equally devastating, with residents describing how the fire advanced ‘in seconds.’ Many of the residents ‘were saved from the fire because they ran to the beach,’ Alejandro Arredondo, 57, told AFP. ‘Nothing was left standing.’ In the town of Lirquen, soldiers were patrolling the streets as night fell on Sunday. Despite a curfew, some residents armed with flashlights continued working to clear debris or put out fires. President Gabriel Boric declared a state of emergency in Nuble and Biobio as nearly 4,000 firefighters battled the wildfires — raging during the high temperatures of the southern hemisphere summer. The order allows for the deployment of the armed forces to assist. The president traveled to the badly impacted city of Concepcion to oversee the firefighting efforts. Boric announced a nighttime curfew in the most affected towns, warning, ‘conditions are very difficult.’ He returned to Santiago in the evening, pledging to meet with president-elect Jose Antonio Kast on Monday to share information about the forest fires. ‘In difficult times, Chile is united. Our government and the president-elect will work together,’ he said. Alicia Cebrian, the director of the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response, said most of the evacuations were in the Biobio towns of Penco and Lirquen, which have a combined population of around 60,000 people. The weather forecast Sunday was bad for firefighters — high temperatures and strong winds, said Esteban Krause, the head of a forest preservation agency in Biobio. Wildfires have severely impacted south-central Chile in recent years amid growing signs of the impact of climate change in the South American country, including extreme weather, droughts and floods. In February 2024, several fires broke out simultaneously near the city of Vina del Mar, northwest of Santiago, resulting in 138 deaths, according to the public prosecutor’s office. About 16,000 people were affected by those fires, authorities said.

Today, the city’s air was classified as ‘very unhealthy’, indicating a serious health threat, according to the AQI report. Delhi in India, Lahore in Pakistan, and Kolkata in India occupied the first, second, and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 541, 312, and 204 respectively. According to the AQI scale, a reading between 50 and 100 is considered ‘moderate’, with generally acceptable air quality, though sensitive individuals should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. AQI levels of 101–150 are ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, 151–200 is ‘unhealthy’, 201–300 is ‘very unhealthy’, and readings above 301 are considered ‘hazardous’, posing severe health risks. The AQI, which reports daily air quality, informs residents how clean or polluted the air is and highlights potential health effects. In Bangladesh, the AQI is calculated based on five key pollutants — particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone. Dhaka has long struggled with air pollution. Air quality usually deteriorates in winter and improves during the monsoon season. The World Health Organisation estimates that air pollution causes about seven million deaths worldwide each year, primarily from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.

{"title": "New Age | Senegal stun Morocco in chaotic AFCON final", "body": "FIFA president Gianni Infantino condemned ‘some Senegal players’ for the ‘unacceptable scenes’ which overshadowed their victory in Sunday’s Africa Cup of Nations final when they left the pitch in protest at a penalty awarded to Morocco. African football’s showpiece event was marred by most of the Senegal team walking off when, deep into injury time of normal play and with the match locked at 0-0, Morocco were awarded a spot-kick following a VAR check by referee Jean-Jacques Ndala for a challenge on Brahim Diaz. As a group of their enraged fans fought with Moroccan security personnel at the other end of the stadium, Senegal’s players eventually returned to the pitch to see Diaz shoot a soft penalty into the arms of their goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Senegal went on to win the final with a brilliant goal from Pape Gueye in extra time, stunning the vast majority of the 66,526 fans at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat. ‘We strongly condemn the behaviour of some ‘supporters’ as well as some Senegalese players and technical staff members,’ Infantino said in a statement to AFP. ‘It is unacceptable to leave the field of play in this manner, and equally, violence cannot be tolerated in our sport, it is simply not right.’ African football’s governing body CAF did not allocate blame but said they would take ‘appropriate action’ against those ‘found guilty’. Infantino praised Morocco for its organisation of the tournament -- a boost for the North African nation in what was effectively a dress rehearsal for their co-hosting of the men’s 2030 World Cup. However, Morocco coach Walid Regragui was worried by the damage done globally to African football by the chaotic final. ‘The image we gave of African football was rather shameful. Having to stop the game for more than 10 minutes with the world watching is not very classy,’ said Regragui. Infantino’s statement appeared to be designed to avoid criticising Senegal’s former Liverpool star Sadio Mane, who remained on the pitch and urged his team-mates to return to the game for the penalty. Senegal were already furious at having a goal disallowed for a soft-looking foul minutes earlier. The trouble broke out in the stands as some Senegalese fans tried to enter the field of play and started fighting with security personnel, some smashing chairs over them. The game was held up for almost 20 minutes before Diaz could take the penalty, and his weak ‘panenka’ kick was saved by Mendy. Guey, whose strike in the fourth minute of extra time gave Senegal a 1-0 win, said his team had walked off due to a ‘feeling of injustice’. ‘Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn’t go to VAR,’ said Gueye. ‘Sadio told us to come back on and we re-mobilised.’ Senegal coach Pape Thiaw admitted to broadcaster beIN Sports that he had erred in telling the players to walk off. ‘After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn’t have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,’ said Thiaw. ‘Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.’ Infantino, who was seen talking to Mane during the trophy presentation, said teams have to abide by the match officials’ decisions. ‘We must always respect the decisions taken by the match officials on and off the field of play... because anything less puts the very essence of football at risk.’ Infantino, who will be hoping there are no such scenes in this year’s World Cup finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico, said Sunday’s events sent the wrong message to supporters round the world. ‘It is also the responsibility of teams and players to act responsibly and set the right example for fans in the stadiums and millions watching around the world,’ he said. ‘The ugly scenes witnessed today must be condemned and never repeated... and I expect that the relevant disciplinary bodies at CAF will take the appropriate measures.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/288624/senegal-stun-morocco-in-chaotic-afcon-final", "date": "2026-01-19T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 713}

At a press conference on Sunday afternoon, Rajshahi BGB Battalion commander lieutenant colonel Riaz Shahriar said that acting on a tip-off, three special patrol teams were deployed in the border-adjacent No 10 Char area under Paba upazila at about 11:30pm on Saturday. ‘Using night vision devices, BGB members observed an unidentified person crossing border from the neighbouring country into Bangladesh and burying a bag near a bush before leaving the area,’ he said. As the spot was close to the zero line, the patrol teams refrained from immediate pursuit and waited to see whether local smugglers would retrieve the consignment, he added. After no one appeared until dawn, BGB members searched the area and recovered the buried bag containing two US-made pistols wrapped in cloth, four magazines and eight rounds of ammunition, the commander said. He said that ahead of the upcoming 13th Jatiya Sangsad elections, BGB had intensified border surveillance and security operations across nine upazilas and one city corporation in Rajshahi, covering six parliamentary constituencies. ‘Twenty-eight platoons of mobile and striking forces, two platoons of central reserve forces, K-9 units, seven speedboats and fast patrol craft on the Padma River, and additional striking reserves at 16 border outposts will be deployed. More than 700 BGB members are expected to be engaged in election-related duties,’ he said. He added that 11 temporary base camps would also be set up to ensure effective election security. In three border upazilas, BGB would independently maintain law and order, while in other areas it would work jointly with the army, police, Rapid Action Battalion and Ansar members, he said. Deployment across all election areas is scheduled to be completed between January 29 and February 1, he added. Following deployment, temporary check posts will be established at 30 key points across the nine upazilas and the city corporation, alongside regular patrols to ensure overall security at polling centres.

The 24-second clip shows Hamza distorting the names of the late president Ziaur Rahman and Arafat Rahman Koko, the younger son of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, comparing Koko’s name to that of an animal. The video has drawn strong criticism from local political leaders, activists, and social media users. Kushtia district BNP convener Kutub Uddin Ahmed issued a written protest, describing the language as ‘obscene and irresponsible’ and warning that it could disrupt the election environment ahead of the upcoming parliamentary polls. Engineer Zakir Hossain Sarkar, the BNP-nominated candidate for Kushtia-3, said the party has filed a formal protest and alerted the Election Commission and other relevant authorities regarding the matter. Abdul Hakim Masud, president of the Kushtia District Swechchhasebak Dal, condemned the remarks and demanded a public apology from Hamza. Responding to the controversy, Mufti Amir Hamza on Sunday released a statement on Facebook, claiming the footage was from 2023 and that he had already expressed regret at that time.

At the report launch event, urban planners, experts and stakeholders urged the government to allow the transition of the paddle-run rickshaws to battery-run by checking all safety sides and expenses. The report titled ‘Urban mobility study in Dhaka: rickshaws in transition’ was launched at an event at BDBL Building in the capital on Sunday. The study explores the economic, social and operational dimensions of rickshaws in Dhaka, focusing on drivers, passengers and garage owners. The study is based on primary data collected from 384 rickshaw pullers, 392 passengers and 63 garage owners across Dhaka city. While presenting the key findings of the study, INNOVISION Consulting managing director Md Rubaiyath Sarwar said that the study examined the rapid transition of Dhaka city’s transport-scape as paddle-driven rickshaws were transformed to battery-powered vehicles. As per the findings, 82 per cent sample passengers prefer battery-powered rickshaws for faster commute and primarily use the vehicle for short-distance travel covering 1–3 kilometres. In the study, 30 per cent respondent passengers reported accidents involving battery-powered rickshaws, compared with 18 per cent accidents involving paddle-run rickshaws, with injuries from battery-powered rickshaw accidents reported as more serious. Regarding Dhaka city corporation registration, 97.4 per cent of the battery-powered rickshaws and 85.94 per cent of the paddle-run rickshaws were operating without any registration. Battery-powered rickshaws which were found to have city corporation registration actually got their registration when they were paddle-run rickshaws. Urban and regional planning professor Akter Mahmud of Jahangirnagar University said that while addressing the rickshaw issue the authorities must consider increasing public transport and pedestrian facilities. Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority’s traffic enforcement officer Md Selim Khan said that currently 8–10 lakh paddle-run and 10 lakh battery-powered rickshaws ply in Dhaka city. The findings also reveal that 75 per cent of the battery-powered rickshaw pullers are new entrants who never drove paddle-run rickshaws. Battery-powered rickshaw pullers earn higher gross daily income (Tk 880 on average) than paddle-run rickshaw pullers (Tk 594 on average), but due to high rental costs, battery-powered rickshaw pullers earn lower net income. Self-owned battery-run rickshaw pullers, however, earn significantly higher. For transition, 42.34 per cent of the battery-powered rickshaw pullers mentioned less physical stress followed by 31.53 per cent mentioned higher demand from passengers and 20.72 per cent mentioned higher income. For owning rickshaws, 59.7 per cent battery-powered rickshaw pullers took microfinance while 60 per cent paddle-run rickshaw pullers used personal savings. Of the sample garage owners, 62 per cent preferred battery-powered rickshaws for higher demand and income potential, while they also expressed concerns about frequent repairs and maintenance costs. The discussants at the report launch programme also stressed using more environmental-friendly battery for motorised rickshaws. Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology professor Md Musleh Uddin Hasan, Voice for Reform co-conveners Fahim Mashroor and Syed Hasibuddin Hossain, Akij Motors general manager Iftekhar Hossain, Padakkhep Manabik Unnayan Kendra joint director Shazib Hasnat, European Union programme manager Taif Hossain, Cassetex Ltd cofounder Tauseef Anwar and Shebok vice-president Md Monirul Islam spoke at the event, among others. The two Dhaka city corporations on January 3 this year inaugurated relatively environment-friendly ‘e-rickshaws’ manufactured by BUET experts on pilot basis in three areas in the city.

{"title": "New Age | Iran considers ‘gradually’ restoring internet after shutdown", "body": "Iranian authorities have said they are considering ‘gradually’ restoring internet access after imposing an unprecedented communications shutdown 10 days ago, which rights groups say masked a violent protest crackdown that killed thousands. Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years. Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into ‘riots’ and blamed foreign influence, namely from Iran’s foes the United States and Israel. The rallies subsided after the crackdown that rights groups have called a ‘massacre’ carried out by security forces under the cover of a communications blackout that started on January 8 as the protests grew in size and intensity. Government officials have said calm has been restored, with schools reopening on Sunday — Iran’s weekend falling on Thursday and Friday — after a week of closure. Late Saturday, the Tasnim news agency reported ‘the relevant authorities announced that internet access would also be gradually restored’, but gave no further details. Citing an unnamed ‘informed source’, the agency said local messaging applications ‘will soon be activated’ on Iran’s domestic intranet. On Sunday morning, AFP was able to connect to the internet from its Tehran office, though the vast majority of internet providers and mobile internet remain cut. Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored Saturday morning. For days, text messages and international phone calls — and at times even local calls — were cut off. Iran has since been relying on its intranet, which has supported local media websites, ride-hailing apps, delivery service and banking platforms. Despite the restrictions, information had still filtered out, with reports of atrocities emerging, according to rights groups. Amnesty International said it had verified dozens of videos and accounts in recent days. They showed ‘that security forces have been relentlessly firing at protesters from the streets and from elevated positions’ and that hospitals had been ‘overwhelmed with the injured’ in a ‘massacre of protesters’, said Amnesty’s Iran researcher Raha Bahreini in a video posted online. Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights says it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic republic’s health and medical system, eyewitnesses and multiple independent sources. However, the NGO warns the true toll is likely far higher. Media cannot independently confirm the figure and Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll for the protests. Other estimates place the death toll at more than 5,000 — and possibly as high as 20,000 — though the internet blackout has severely hampered independent verification, IHR says. The opposition Iran International channel based outside the country has said at least 12,000 people were killed during the protests, citing senior government and security sources. Iran’s judiciary has rejected that figure. On Saturday, supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ‘a few thousand’ people had been killed by what he called ‘agents’ of the United States and Israel, and Iranian local media has reported multiple deaths among security forces. Khamenei said authorities ‘must break the back of the seditionists’, as local media has reported thousands of arrests and rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been detained. On Sunday, Iran’s judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir reiterated that swift trials would be held, warning that some acts were tantamount to the capital offence of ‘moharebeh’, or ‘waging war against God’. ‘All those who played a decisive role in these calls for violence, which led to bloodshed and significant damage to public finances, will not be spared,’ he said. Alarm has grown over the threat of capital punishment against arrested protesters, even as Donald Trump said Iran had called off hundreds of executions. The US president, who backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June, had repeatedly threatened new military action against Tehran if protesters were killed. Analyst Arif Keskin cast doubt on Trump’s claim, saying ‘the Iranian leadership sees executions as an effective tool to end protests, prevent them, and suppress them’. ‘For the regime, executions will carry short-term international costs but are seen as a long-term investment in domestic security,’ the Ankara-based Iranian researcher and Middle East specialist said. ‘The risk therefore remains very real.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/middle-east/288616/iran-considers-gradually-restoring-internet-after-shutdown", "date": "2026-01-19T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 739}
{"title": "New Age | Netanyahu holds coalition meeting after objecting to Gaza panel", "body": "Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened a meeting of his ruling coalition partners on Sunday after objecting to the composition of a Gaza advisory panel formed by the White House, according to an official and media reports. The White House announced this week the setting up of a ‘Gaza Executive Board,’ which would operate under a broader ‘Board of Peace’ to be chaired by US president Donald Trump as part of his 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza. The executive board, described as having an advisory role, includes Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi, alongside other regional and international officials. Late on Saturday, Netanyahu’s office objected to the composition of the executive board. ‘The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy,’ the office of Netanyahu said. ‘The prime minister has instructed the foreign affairs minister to contact the US secretary of state on this matter.’ It did not explain the reason for its objection, but Israel has previously objected strongly to any Turkish role in post-war Gaza, with relations between the two countries deteriorating sharply since the war began in October 2023. In addition to naming Turkey’s foreign minister to the executive board, Trump has also invited Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan to join the overarching Board of Peace. Media reports said that leaders of the country’s ruling coalition were scheduled to meet on Sunday to examine the composition of the executive board. ‘There is a meeting scheduled of the coalition at 10:00am (0800 GMT),’ the spokesman of Netanyahu’s Likud Party said. Alongside Likud, the coalition includes the Religious Zionist Party led by far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit Jewish Power led by far-right national security minister Itamar Ben Gvir. The White House said Trump’s plan would include three bodies: the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump; a Palestinian committee of technocrats tasked with governing Gaza; and the Gaza Executive Board, which would play an advisory role. The Palestinian technocratic committee held its first meeting in Cairo on Saturday. The diplomatic developments came as the United States said this week that the Gaza truce plan had entered a second phase, shifting from implementing a ceasefire to the disarmament of Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack on Israel triggered the Israeli offensive in Gaza.

Deceased Mizanur Rahman Rony, 35, a resident of Jaindapur area of Kabirhat municipality, was the father of two children, the police said, adding that he was implicated in multiple criminal cases, including arms and robbery cases. Rony was attacked at about 10:00pm Saturday on the road in front of Kazi Bari adjacent to Kalirhat Bazar in Ward 2 of Narottampur union, said Md Nizam Uddin Bhuiyan, Kabirhat police officer-in-charge. ‘On information that a man was beaten to death, the police went to the scene. A toy pistol and a switchblade were recovered from his pocket,’ he said. Perpetrators were yet to be identified while the family asked for some time to file a formal complaint, OC Nizam said, adding that legal action would be taken following an investigation once a complaint was received. Sometime before he was attacked, Mizanur had a heated argument with local Bangladesh Nationalist Party activists who were having an election-related meeting at their office at Kalirhat Bazar at about 8:00pm. ‘We were in a meeting at our office when Mijanur entered and became engaged in an argument, former BNP president for Ward 2 Harunur Rashid Harun said. Saying that Mizanur left the office at one point, Harun stated, ‘later I heard that unidentified people killed him and left his body on the road.’ Mijanur reportedly claimed himself as a ‘dedicated worker’ of the BNP, said several individuals who claimed they had witnessed the heated argument. They also said that he was chased out by the BNP activists present at the office. Later, several of them reportedly caught him in front of Kazi Bari and beat him indiscriminately, leaving him dead on the spot, witnesses claimed. Meanwhile, some youths reportedly distributed sweets at a nearby market following the incident, allegedly branding the deceased a ‘robber’.

{"title": "New Age | Russian drone strike kills woman in Kharkiv", "body": "A Russian strike on Ukraine’s northeastern city of Kharkiv killed a 20‑year‑old woman and wounded several others overnight, regional officials said early Sunday. ‘There is information about one person killed as a result of an enemy drone strike on a private house,’ Kharkiv mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram. Regional governor Oleg Synegubov later said a UAV slammed into the residence, killing a 20‑year‑old woman and wounding another. Synegubov also said a 41‑year‑old woman suffered an ‘acute stress reaction’ after the strike. The strikes extended beyond Kharkiv. In the northeastern Sumy region, emergency services said an air strike on a residential neighbourhood wounded three women and a seven‑year‑old child. Preliminary assessments showed damage to 15 residential buildings. In the Odesa region, Izmail district officials reported another Russian attack, again targeting critical infrastructure sites. Initial information indicated no casualties, though officials said the strike continued a pattern of repeated assaults on the Danube port region. The strikes come as Ukrainian negotiators arrived in the United States Saturday for talks with president Donald Trump’s administration on how to end four years of war with Russia, expected to focus on security guarantees and post-war recovery. The war is Europe’s worst conflict since World War II. More than 200,000 homes in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine were left without power following a Ukrainian army attack, the Moscow-installed authorities said Sunday. ‘Following an enemy attack on the region’s energy infrastructure, a large part of the Zaporizhzhia region has been left without electricity,’ Moscow-installed official Yevgeny Balitsky said on Telegram. According to Balitsky, the attack cut power to 2,13,000 customers and 386 localities in the Zaporizhzhia region. Vladimir Saldo, the Moscow-installed governor of the neighbouring Kherson region, said on Saturday evening that a Ukrainian strike had hit an electrical substation, causing outages in 14 towns and 450 villages. He later said that emergency repair work had restored power. Russia has hit Ukraine with daily drone and missile barrages in recent months, targeting energy infrastructure and cutting power and heating in the frigid depths of winter. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky last week declared a ‘state of emergency’ for the sector and said work was under way to increase the country’s electricity imports. ‘The situation in the energy system remains difficult, but we are doing everything we can to restore all services as quickly as possible,’ he said Sunday. According to Ukraine’s air force, Russia launched 201 drones overnight from Saturday to Sunday, 167 of which were shot down. Two people were killed, Zelensky said.

{"title": "New Age | RUCSU GS removes congratulatory banner for Tarique Rahman", "body": "Rajshahi University Central Students’ Union general secretary Salahuddin Ammar on Sunday removed a congratulatory banner put up on the campus welcoming Tarique Rahman on becoming the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s chairman. At about 2:30pm, Ammar removed the banner installed on Paris Road by professor Mohammad Nesar Uddin, the RU Arabic department professor and Zia Parishad Rajshahi district unit president. Earlier in the day at about 11:30am, Ammar issued an ultimatum through a Facebook post, asking the relevant teacher to remove the banner by 2:00pm. In the post, he cited Section 55 (2) of the Rajshahi University Act, 1973, claiming that it prohibits party politics, political campaign on campus, and the use of teachers’ associations for partisan political activities. However, Section 55 (2) of the act states that ‘the service conditions shall be determined without any prejudice to the freedom of the teacher or officer to hold any political views and to keep association with any lawful organisation outside the University and shall be clearly stated in the contract.’ After removing the banner, Ammar shared a video on Facebook explaining that he had requested the teacher remove it within the stipulated time and since no action was taken, he removed it himself as a student. ‘I will oppose any display of partisan banner politics by teachers whenever I see it on campus. Teacher politics is destroying education and turning individuals into political brokers,’ he wrote. In another Facebook post, Ammar said that the same stance would be applied to Jamaat-e-Islami as well, though he claimed that the party had so far not displayed any banners, held rallies or openly expressed political identity on the campus. ‘You may belong to or practise the politics of any party, but do it outside the campus,’ he added. Ammar further said that while students were demanding a ban on student politics, the root of the problem lay in what he described as ‘dangerous teacher politics’, urging students to become vocal against it. Contacted, Ammar told New Age that the explicit mention of the phrase ‘outside of the university’ in Section 55 clearly implied that no political activities were permitted within the university premises. He argued that if political activities were lawful inside the campus, there would have been no need to specifically mention ‘outside’ in the ordinance. He further claimed that legal language was not always written in a literal or plain manner; rather, it required contextual and interpretative understanding. Meanwhile, terming the incident ‘barbaric’, professor Mohammad Nesar Uddin questioned how a congratulatory banner in Tarique Rahman’s honour could cause any harm to Rajshahi University. ‘I strongly condemn and protest this act,’ he said, alleging that student leaders were neglecting their studies and instead roaming the campus monitoring activities. ‘I leave the judgement of this matter to the nation,’ he added.

BNP’s Chattogram city unit, in a press release on Sunday, condemned the inclusion of its leaders and activists in the CMP list and alleged a lack of transparency in preparing the list. It claimed that the initial list had included names of 15 BNP leaders and activists, including Shawkat Azam. They also alleged that the list included names of dead people and that some people who faced ‘false’ cases over the past 17 years for joining movements demanding a neutral election.

The film has been selected for the International Shorts Competition, fiction, category scheduled to be held in Kathmandu from April 2 to 6. Memories and Miseries revolves around a soul revisiting three fragments of its existence— a solitary writer, a war-haunted priest and his soul being in the state of limbo— searching for meaning through spirituality, loneliness and the memories full of sufferings. The film follows the introspective journey of a soul who is caught between divinity and the complications of human emotion. Lying by the riverside, the soul revisits scattered periods of its life: one as a writer exploring the human condition and another as a priest scarred by war. The film explores the interwoven threads of memory, fate and the eternal struggles between transcendence and suffering. Each life, a moment in the soul’s quest for meaning, leaves behind traces of joy, pain and redemption. Fakhrul Alam has said that in creating and developing Memories and Miseries, he has attempted to explore the deeper, unspoken layers of human lives— the moments where memory and emotion collide, where the soul grapples with its purpose and its past. ‘Traveling for almost a decade throughout the country like a dervish, I had always longed for expressing stories I have lived through,’ he mentioned. Harif Siraj, Khalid Hasan Rumi and Fakhrul Alam have played different roles in the film while Ariq Anam Khan leads the narration from background.

{"title": "New Age | Real fans within their rights to boo us: Arbeloa", "body": "Real Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa said his club’s fans had the right to jeer him and his team, as they did on Saturday during their 2-0 La Liga win over Levante. Arbeloa earned his first victory as Madrid coach but along with stars Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham, was booed and whistled by home supporters at the Santiago Bernabeu. Arbeloa was appointed on Monday, replacing Xabi Alonso after Madrid lost the Spanish Super Cup final against rivals Barcelona, and in his first match at the helm the club crashed out of the Copa del Rey against second-tier Albacete. ‘We didn’t come from a good week and the fans are well within their rights to show their discontent with all the players, with the team, with me first of all,’ Arbeloa told reporters. ‘I think the whistles were for everyone, and me first of all because I am the leader of this team and I’m someone who when things aren’t going well, you have to call out.’ Arbeloa said the fans’ rage was something which has made Madrid the most successful club in world football. ‘I’ve always respected the Bernabeu (crowd), they whistled me a lot too, and it’s one of the aspects that make this club so great, the demand of the fans,’ said the Spaniard, who turned 43 on Saturday. ‘We know the week we’ve had, we know this is the biggest club in the world, where people want the maximum, and we know what the Bernabeu is asking of us. ‘I think that demand we will always take it well, because they know we can do a lot more, we can give a lot more, we have to be at the level of Real Madrid, and I have nothing to rebuke our fans for.’ Brazilian winger Vinicius was the player who came in for the most ire from Los Blancos fans. Arbeloa said he would try and get the best from the forward, who went on a 16 game run without scoring before netting against Barca last Sunday. ‘It’s clear for me as Madrid coach, I’ll work to get the best version of Vinicius, and I’ll ask his team-mates to find him more, give him the ball as much as possible,’ said Arbeloa. The 25-year-old signed for Madrid in 2018 and has won two Champions Leagues and three La Liga titles among other trophies. ‘What Vinicius has done since arriving here as a kid, few have done in the history of Real Madrid,’ continued the coach. ‘I’m very proud to be his coach and I’ll work with him to get the best of him, because he will bring us many trophies, as he has done already.’ Arbeloa praised his team for playing under the pressure and said the squad had done well this week given the club’s situation, cutting the gap on Liga leaders Barcelona to one point. ‘I had 11 brave players who were on the pitch, and 20 during the week, because not only those who played today did very well, with a lot of positive energy,’ said the coach. ‘We know within the dressing room that we will improve, we will work and we’ll fight for everything.’ Editor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd. +8802-9632245-48 [email protected] For Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831 Email: [email protected]", "url": "https://www.newagebd.net/post/football/288603/real-fans-within-their-rights-to-boo-us-arbeloa", "date": "2026-01-19T00:00:00", "language": "en", "tokens_count": 562}

She made the call while addressing a policy dialogue titled ‘Women in Nation-Building: Policy, Potential and the Future of Bangladesh’ at the Krishibid Institution Bangladesh in the capital’s Farmgate area. ‘When women are welcomed rather than pushed aside, they do not change their own lives only, they change the future of their families and the future of the nation as well,’ she said. ‘If Bangladesh truly seeks sustainable development, empowerment cannot remain limited to education, offices or policies alone, it must reach our homes, institutions and mindsets,’ she said. ‘I stand here today with a different sense of emotion and feeling. This is my first speech at the policy level in Bangladesh. I am not someone who has answers to all questions or solutions to all problems,’ Zaima said. ‘Still, I believe that from our own small positions, each of us should have the sincerity to do something for society and for the country,’ she said. Zaima, who returned to the country with her family on December 25, 2025, after about one and a half decades abroad, highlighted the contributions of her grandfather, BNP founder Ziaur Rahman, and her grandmother, BNP chairperson and former prime minister Khaleda Zia, to women’s advancement. BNP standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury attended the programme as the chief guest and outlined the party’s plans for women’s empowerment. The programme, moderated by presenter Kazi Jessin, was also addressed, among others, by Centre for Policy Dialogue’s executive director Fahmida Khatun, BRAC Enterprises managing director Tamara Hasan Abed, and FICCI chairperson and Berger Paints Bangladesh managing director Rupali Haque Chowdhury. During the question-and-answer session, Zaima spoke about women’s safety, noting concerns particularly in online spaces and among women under 25, both online and offline, and emphasised the need to address behavioural, cultural and social factors. BNP standing committee member Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury attended the programme as the chief guest and outlined the party’s plans for women’s empowerment. ‘Our party has various action plans to bring women forward. In this regard, our leader Tarique Rahman has proposed introducing a family card,’ he said. ‘Women will receive greater benefits from BNP’s plans. Our programmes for women are not mere promises; we have spent long hours working out how these plans will be implemented,’ he said. Centre for Policy Dialogue’s executive director Fahmida Khatun, speaking as a discussant, said that the biggest barrier to women’s development is access to finance, particularly for small women entrepreneurs who face multiple obstacles in obtaining loans. She urged the future governments to give special attention to the issue. BRAC Enterprises managing director Tamara Hasan Abed said that women should be viewed not merely as part of the population but as human resources, and that the hidden potential among women must be brought forward.

{"title": "Protecting public health", "body": "We should collectively be moving towards a culture that rejects smoking, not one that inadvertently encourages it The recent distribution of free cigarettes near Dhaka University is disappointing to say the least. It is more so a shocking misstep at a time when Bangladesh should be actively discouraging, not normalizing, smoking -- especially in and around educational spaces. Universities are meant to be cornerstones of learning, aspiration, and healthy debate, where young adults prepare for responsible roles in society. Handing out cigarettes in such a setting, on top of violating laws against it, is therefore also trivializing an irresponsible and hazardous action in front of young minds. Smoking has famously been linked to respiratory disease, heart problems, cancer, and premature death, and an enabling of something so clearly unhealthy undermines ongoing public health efforts to reduce tobacco consumption. Public policy in recent years has rightly focused on reducing smoking rates through awareness campaigns, restrictions on advertising, graphic packaging warnings, and higher taxes on tobacco products. These are positive and necessary steps, but actions such as handing out free cigarettes near a major university counteract those efforts, risk normalizing smoking among young people, and send mixed signals about our collective priorities. Discouraging tobacco use is not about moral policing; it is about protecting public health, especially the health of young adults who are most susceptible to marketing ploys and peer pressure. Educational campuses, at the very least, should be smoke-free -- where future leaders are encouraged to choose health over habit. We should collectively be moving towards a culture that rejects smoking, not one that inadvertently encourages it. Free cigarettes near an educational institution may generate momentary excitement, but it does nothing to advance the long-term wellbeing of our youth or our nation. Let us instead push in the direction of healthier choices, clearer public health messaging, and environments that support rather than undermine public well-being.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/401399/protecting-public-health", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 315}
{"title": "Mob violence must be confronted with punitive action", "body": "Law enforcement must act swiftly and impartially when mobs gather to intimidate or attack, and leaders The recurring incidents of mob violence in Bangladesh -- especially against our minority groups -- are a deeply troubling reminder of a persistent and corrosive mentality that insists on retaliation over reason, and instant judgement over justice. Such outbreaks of collective rage do not just threaten individuals -- they undermine the very idea of law, order, and social harmony. Bangladesh has long been a society where diversity is woven into its social fabric. Our constitutional commitments to secularism and equal protection under the law are the foundations of a society where every citizen, regardless of belief or background, should feel secure. When groups punish perceived wrongdoing without due process, the foundations of justice are weakened. Mob violence thrives on fear and rumour, replacing accountability with collective anger. This is not justice, but disorder in the name of righteousness. It is a practice we must work together to end: Not only for the protection of minorities, but for the safety, respect, and fair participation for all -- especially as the nation approaches its next elections. We must address the underlying mentality that sees violence as a legitimate response to conflict. This requires sustained efforts in education, community leadership, and civic discourse that emphasize respect for due process, restraint, and rule of law. Law enforcement must act swiftly and impartially when mobs gather to intimidate or attack, and leaders -- political, religious, or social -- must unequivocally condemn these behaviours. There is no place in a mature society for violence in the name of justice. Protecting every citizen’s rights, particularly those of minorities, is not an optional commitment -- it is a measure of who we are. If Bangladesh is to live up to its principles, mob violence must be confronted not just with punitive action, but with a collective reaffirmation of law, dignity, and mutual respect.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/401398/mob-violence-must-be-confronted-with-punitive", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 321}

{"title": "The prosecutor and the prize", "body": "The trial of the Nobel Peace Prize is the trial of a decaying world order The first scene was a masterpiece of soft power. On December 10, 2025, in Oslo’s grand hall, under crystalline lights, María Corina Machado accepted the Nobel Peace Prize. The language was of “fraternity between nations” and “peaceful transition,” the venerable script from Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will. Yet, even as she spoke, US naval armadas gathered in the Caribbean -- the largest buildup since 1962 -- conducting strikes and speaking of “national security priorities.” The ceremony was not a celebration of peace, but a meticulously staged prelude. The second scene was one of legal defiance. On December 17, refusing the script of martyrdom after years of persecution, Julian Assange resurrected not as a victim but as a prosecutor. From Sweden, he filed a criminal complaint accusing 30 members of the Nobel Foundation of misappropriation of funds, facilitation of war crimes, and financing crimes of aggression. He argued the 11 million kronor for Machado risked fueling the very aggression Nobel sought to prevent. It was a precise indictment: The peace prize, he charged, had become a weapon of war. The third scene revealed the brutal reality the prize had laundered. In the early hours of January 3, 2026, US special forces launched Operation Absolute Resolve, a military raid on Caracas. President Donald Trump, monitoring from Mar-a-Lago, watched as airstrikes preceded Delta Force operators abducting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife from their bed. At least 83 people were killed, including Venezuelan and Cuban personnel. Trump announced the US would now “run the country,” explicitly tying the action to controlling Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. The “peaceful transition” honored in Oslo had reached its logical, violent conclusion. The final scene completed the transaction. On January 16, in the Oval Office, Machado presented her physical Nobel medal to Trump -- a man who had long coveted the award. The medal was framed as a “personal symbol of gratitude.” The Nobel Foundation’s feeble reminder that a laureate title cannot be transferred only underscored the institution’s irrelevance. The prize had journeyed from moral symbol to geopolitical token, a coin exchanged in a marketplace of power and invasion. These scenes are not disconnected episodes. They are the cascading cause and effect of a prize weaponized. Assange, the man the West tried to silence, had identified the crime in its planning stage. His filing was the charge sheet for a war yet to come. Assange’s complaint is not political theatre but a legal argument about a broken contract: Alfred Nobel’s will. That document mandates the prize for those who do the “most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies.” His filing to Sweden’s Economic Crimes Authority cataloged how Machado’s record was the antithesis of this purpose. It detailed her statements endorsing US military escalation as “the only way,” praising extrajudicial killings as “visionary,” and applauding Israel’s actions in Gaza. By awarding a figure who incited aggression, Assange argued, the Foundation committed a “gross misappropriation” of charitable funds, violating its fiduciary duty and transforming an endowment for peace into a financing mechanism for war. His action was prophetic. Filed weeks before Operation Absolute Resolve, it legally framed the Nobel Committee not as passive observers but as active facilitators. They had provided the moral capital for a campaign that would soon demand blood and steel. A prize for geopolitics, not peace The Machado award is a symptom of a long disease. From Henry Kissinger onward, the prize has served as Western soft power, rewarding figures who align with its interests. This is the hypocrisy of the “rules-based order”: The rules are narratives; the order is hegemony. When a foundation in Stockholm and a committee in Oslo twist a “peace” prize into an endorsement for regime change, they expose the institution as a component of power. As Nobel laureate Adolfo Pérez Esquivel stated, giving this prize to someone who calls for foreign invasion is a profound betrayal of Nobel’s will. The abduction of Maduro merely confirmed the violent intent the prize had already morally sanctioned. How the narrative is weaponized The prize is the ultimate narrative weapon. It launders projects of resource access and dominance with the impeccable brand of “peace.” This functions within an ecosystem of media bias that systematically erases inconvenient facts. Western coverage sanitized Machado’s history: Her support for the 2002 coup, her leadership of violent unrest, her lobbying for devastating sanctions, and her alignment with far-right parties globally were omitted. The media did not scrutinize; it sanctified, transforming a figure calling for invasion into a “defender of democracy.” The Nobel provided the moral headline; the media became its amplifier, beating the war drums under a banner of peace. A prize as a political pawn The Oval Office meeting was the cynical epilogue. Machado’s gift to Trump was a desperate appeal for favour from the architect of her rival’s abduction. Yet, in a stark lesson in realpolitik, Trump had already rejected her, reportedly upset she accepted “his” prize. He instead backed Delcy Rodríguez, the Venezuelan vice-president installed by the Supreme Court as interim president after the abduction of Maduro. This transaction stripped the Nobel of its final veneer. It became a bargaining chip, its golden sheen reflecting the cold calculus of oil and power. The Committee’s procedural objections were meaningless; the prize had fulfilled its purpose. This moment is a clarion call for sovereign construction, not reform. The nations of the Global South cannot forever beg for a seat at a broken table. The solidarity is already here: In the 21 Norwegian peace organizations that boycotted the ceremony, in the Venezuelan people facing occupation, and in social movements worldwide that recognize this pattern from their own histories. Assange’s complaint is a necessary act of exposure. But the solution lies in building our own tables. We must champion sovereign institutions -- our own peace awards, media networks, and forums that reflect genuine self-determination, not the fraternity of empires. Julian Assange handed us the shovel. He refused the martyr’s script and filed the charge sheet, anticipating the crime. The trial of the Nobel Peace Prize is the trial of a decaying world order. The verdict will be written in the collective will of the Global South to build a peace that is truly our own.

{"title": "The challenge of establishing institutional democracy", "body": "Corruption and political intervention are the major challenges to upholding the spirit of institutional democracy in Bangladesh Why is institutional democracy so pivotal? This important question has sparked extended academic discussions from various viewpoints. In my numerous scholarly writings and dialogues, I have proposed that democracy is the ideal model that could have been adopted to enhance our daily lives. Furthermore, I have contended that institutional democracy offers a vital avenue for democratic development and reform. Institutional democracy is present when all key stakeholders within an organisation or its network have the authority to make important decisions regarding its values, objectives, and critical management aspects, despite political interventions. Mike O'Donnell, a retired Sociology Professor from Westminster University in London, argues that establishing formal mechanisms for public participation in issues affecting daily life could effectively address the apathy and disconnection often seen in liberal democracies. The idea emphasizes that such measures would lead to a fairer society, reducing the influence of affluent elites over government functioning. However, acknowledging that initiating the reform process poses significant challenges. It is essential for state executives and political parties to avoid using their power for personal or political gain, ensuring that influential individuals do not unduly sway the state government. A critical concern is whether a genuine separation between the nation’s elite, crony capitalists, and the government has ever been achieved, and whether the essence or the actual implementation of institutional democracy in Bangladesh has been achieved. There is an ongoing debate about the impact of crony capitalism on institutional democracy. Crony capitalism is characterized by leveraging political connections for personal benefit and that of one’s associates. The consequences of this phenomenon can be profound, not only in countries like Bangladesh but also in established democracies worldwide. Notably, the level of institutional democracy needed in Bangladesh appears to be considerably lower than in many nations facing similar issues with crony capitalism. In Bangladesh, a specific segment of society engages in systematic financial corruption, leading to serious repercussions for the public across various aspects of life. As a result, citizens often find their basic rights compromised due to ineffective institutional services in the country. Due to crony capitalism, certain players in a particular industry are becoming more robust, and their political connections are strengthening their position in various organizations across the country. In many cases, such retrograde behaviour brings unpleasant consequences for the ordinary people of the state. This means that a backdoor agreement among a few interested parties collectively preserves the entire state's economic process for their benefit and often disrupts the organisation’s rules, regulations, and norms. A just society requires the establishment of institutional democracy. In certain countries where the government is well-structured and adheres to democratic principles, there is evidence of institutional autonomy that serves the common people. However, developing nations face the challenge of fostering institutional democracy amid the influence of geopolitical interests. Furthermore, governments in these developing countries often lack the motivation to democratize their institutions for the benefit of the populace, which results in a detrimental cycle for the nation. It is important to understand that in some Western countries, democracy has also not been well-practised. Every nation is subject to this criticism, suggesting that significant reforms in democratic practices are a primary concern for many states today. However, when a country like Bangladesh faces difficulties in implementing the essential principles of institutional democracy at the grassroots level, numerous other issues remain unresolved. Consequently, citizens often find themselves deprived of their fundamental human rights. Establishing institutional democracy will be a considerable challenge for the upcoming government in Bangladesh, primarily due to years of political division, weakened institutional capacity, and declining public trust. While Bangladesh has upheld formal democratic frameworks -- such as elections, a constitution, and representative institutions -- the effectiveness and autonomy of vital bodies have continuously been under scrutiny. Restoring faith in these organizations will be essential for consolidating democracy after a long period of directorial leadership in Bangladesh, which has sapped the spirit of institutional democracy and weakened organizations such as the Election Commission. One of the primary challenges is ensuring the independence and integrity of electoral institutions. Disputed elections and claims of partisan governance have diminished public confidence in the electoral process. Regaining trust will necessitate transparent electoral reforms, impartial administration, and authentic political competition. Without reliable elections, institutional democracy cannot operate effectively. Another significant challenge is the politicization of governmental institutions, which includes the judiciary, civil service, and law enforcement agencies. When institutions are viewed as extensions of ruling parties rather than neutral protectors of the public interest, accountability diminishes and democratic principles decay. The next administration must show a firm commitment to the rule of law, judicial independence, and a merit-based administration to reverse this trend. To be well remembered, changing the dress code will not bring actual changes in institutional democracy and their independent capacity to operate if the people of the organizations or their leaders do not change culturally and politically. In Bangladesh, there is a strong call for establishing institutional democracy. Therefore, enhancing institutional democracy will rely on inclusive governance and civic engagement. Civil society, media, and opposition parties must be permitted to function freely to provide oversight and represent a variety of interests. In the absence of space for dissent and dialogue, institutions risk becoming ineffective and hollow. The success of the next government will hinge not only on political transformation but also on continuous efforts to rebuild institutions that are autonomous, accountable, and trusted by the citizenry.

{"title": "Why restoring nature can work so much more effectively when led by local people", "body": "Restoring the ability of local communities to be the custodians of nature is a promising approach to both ecological and social recovery The success of restoration efforts hinges on involving local communities. That was the finding of our recent study which explored restoration programs around the world. From the English fens, where soils are degraded from decades of intensive farming, to the cattle rangelands of the Brazilian state of Rondônia where the Amazon rainforest clearance has been extensive, the best option for nature may not be conservation, but restoration . Conservation involves preventing harm to existing nature, while restoration is the repair of ecosystems that have degraded over long periods or due to specific events like an oil spill. Our research found that many restoration projects are run by governments or private organizations with a target-driven focus on planting trees, improving soils or reintroducing species, with limited local input. This often fails to achieve lasting results because of the mismatch with the lives and livelihoods of those most connected to the landscape. Restoration can more effectively reverse degradation, address its causes and benefit local people if communities can shape and lead initiatives to align with their own needs, knowledge and aspirations. Restoration programs are being established around the world at a staggering rate. For example, 196 nations are signatories to a UN target to start restoring 30% of the world’s degraded land and sea by 2030. Worldwide, pledges have already been made to restore over a billion hectares -- an area bigger than the US. This level of ambition is welcome, but there are social and political challenges to be confronted. Degraded lands and seas are nearly always occupied, most often by farming communities. Some are cherished, like the UK’s much-loved “sheep-wrecked” uplands where high numbers of livestock suppress the diversity of vegetation in many places. Restoration may sound universally desirable. Who could be against planting lots of trees or restoring fisheries? But people actively resist restoration that’s imposed on them without their involvement. They might experience harms as well as benefits. In Wales, plans to require farmers to have trees on 10% of their land were dropped after protests . The Scottish government also dropped plans to designate 10% of its seas as highly protected marine areas (areas of the sea where certain activities -- usually fishing -- are banned), due to a lack of community input and protests . A promising alternative centres on local communities shaping the restoration process. We have identified four levels of involvement for Indigenous and local communities in ecological restoration: exclusionary (fully imposed), managerial (with limited consultation or incentives), collaborative (a more genuine partnership) and just and transformative (led by local ideas and values). Four levels of community involvement With a short-term focus on environmental results such as area of trees planted, exclusionary restoration projects may ignore local perspectives or even displace Indigenous people or local communities with rights to the land. In Kenya , logging and charcoal production destroyed parts of the Mau forest affecting downstream water supplies. Since 2009, the government has tried to restore the area, but measures included evicting many Indigenous Ogiek who had sought to protect their forest home. Despite a 2017 ruling of the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights supporting their ancestral claim, the Ogiek’s struggle continues. Sometimes locals are invited to consultations or to manage land for nature, but cannot influence decisions. One example of this managerial approach is Vietnam’s 30-year tree planting program. While tree planting was performed by smallholders, these farmers had little input and many lacked land rights. The focus on growing commercial trees to fell and sell also meant forests were not native and did not mature, so benefits for nature were limited. In collaborative approaches, a more balanced negotiation means locals may influence what is to be restored as well as where, how, by whom and how any benefits will be allocated. In northern India, forest planting projects have involved both the Himachal Pradesh Forest Department and communities. In some areas, local people selected which tree species would be most suitable for fuelwood and livestock fodder or have planted trees and monitored their progress. “Just and transformative” restoration approaches centre around local values, decisions and stewardship. This tends to be more successful for people and nature. The Miawpukek First Nation in Newfoundland, Canada, based restoration around species that are culturally significant to them, like the caribou, blueberries and Labrador tea. Women in India’s Western Ghats are carefully nurturing the plants, creepers and mosses that hold the forest ecosystem together. And community networks lead mangrove restoration in Thailand’s Phang-Nga Bay . Restoring the ability of local communities to be the custodians of nature is a promising approach to both ecological and social recovery -- and ultimately environmental justice .

{"title": "High Court verdict stayed: Comilla-2 polls to be held under EC boundaries", "body": "The legal challenge was initiated by Nazim Uddin Alam, a Jamaat-nominated candidate The Appellate Division has stayed a High Court verdict that declared illegal the Election Commission’s gazette redefining the boundaries of the Comilla-2 constituency, clearing the way for elections to be held under the EC’s revised delimitation. As a result, the Comilla-2 constituency will comprise Homna and Titas upazilas, as determined by the Election Commission. The order was passed on Tuesday by an Appellate Division bench led by Chief Justice Zubair Rahman Chowdhury after granting leave to appeal against the High Court ruling. The legal challenge was initiated by Nazim Uddin Alam, a Jamaat-nominated candidate, who filed a writ petition questioning the legality of the EC’s decision to alter the constituency boundaries. Following the hearing, the High Court issued a rule on September 24, 2025, asking why the boundary changes for the 13th National Parliament election should not be declared illegal. The bench, comprising Justice Md Mujibur Rahman Mia and Justice Bishwajit Debnath, later delivered its verdict on January 8, declaring the EC’s gazette unlawful. The High Court also directed the Election Commission to republish a gazette within 24 hours, restoring the previous boundaries of the Comilla-2 constituency, thereby upholding the rule. Senior lawyers Barrister Ehsan Abdullah Siddique and Barrister Saiful Islam Ujjal represented the petitioner during the High Court proceedings. During the hearing, the lawyers argued that Meghna and Titas upazilas had previously constituted Comilla-2, but under the revised delimitation, Homna was added while Meghna was shifted to Comilla-1. Following the High Court verdict, an appeal was filed with the Appellate Division, which has now stayed the ruling, reinstating the EC-determined boundaries for the upcoming election.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/401393/high-court-verdict-stayed-comilla-2-polls-to-be", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 278}
{"title": "Freeing Bangladesh from polythene bag pollution must be an election pledge", "body": "The commitment to a polythene-free future is a cornerstone in developing a conscientious and sustainable, smart Bangladesh As Bangladesh declares the date of the upcoming parliamentary elections, the country's politicians, policymakers, and citizens are gearing up to shape the country's future. The candidates being nominated in the election are now preparing to make several promises to the general public in hopes of seeking votes from them. Nominees may promise to build a new school, pave the roads, or provide a health care facility. While these development-oriented commitments are fundamental, the commitment to address Bangladesh’s pressing environmental issues remain neglected. Due to the irresponsible disposal of polythene waste, about 80 percent of Dhaka’s sewage and drainage is blocked by polythene bags. As a result, even a little rain causes instant waterlogging. About six months ago, we saw the 2025 World Environment Day campaign use the hashtag #BeatPlasticPollution emphasising the need for global efforts to tackle plastic pollution. Nearly two decades ago, Bangladesh proudly led the charge against plastic pollution and was the first country to ban plastic shopping bags in the market. This pioneering step set an inspiring precedent for other countries. After the polythene ban, plastic bag use came down to almost zero. The ban, recognized as a tremendous exemplary step to reduce environmental pollution, was successful for several years. However, the then stringent enforcement of the polythene ban has gradually lost its enthusiasm, contributing to a decline in public awareness. Despite the existing ban, the nationwide implementation of laws prohibiting polythene usage faces considerable hurdles owing to ineffective enforcement and a lack of widespread consciousness among the general public. Consequently, it is increasingly challenging to gauge the prevalence of harmful plastic bags in Bangladesh, whether in the busy city kitchen markets or the remote villages. There was a time in Bangladesh when people carried a jute bag in hand when visiting the kitchen markets to buy their daily necessities. Nowadays, many go to the market without a reusable bag. A study by the World Bank reveals that despite various initiatives to reduce plastic use, plastic bags have increased almost three times between 2005 and 2020 in Bangladesh. Additionally, a study by the Environment and Social Development Organization states that around 87,000 tonnes of single-use plastic is used annually in Bangladesh. The transboundary rivers of Bangladesh carry approximately 15,345 tonnes of single-use plastic waste daily. A large amount of plastic waste, therefore, falls into the Bay of Bengal every year. Reinstating the ban on plastic bags is therefore crucial to tackle the problem of plastic pollution. Addressing this challenge requires collaborative efforts between governments, political leaders, and social organisations. Including a commitment to ban polythene bags in the election manifesto and prioritising environmental awareness would be significant. When political parties include a good deed in their manifesto, that deed becomes a responsibility and the initiative can significantly influence social consciousness. Since political leaders maintain strong relationships with the general public, they can raise public awareness. Additionally, suggesting possible alternatives to plastic can motivate the public. Encouraging the use of biodegradable bags, championing the discovery of reusable alternatives, and encouraging innovation in sustainable packaging are some necessary steps towards establishing alternatives to polythene bags. Furthermore, all these tasks will be much easier when the election manifesto includes a pledge to eliminate polythene bag pollution. Finally, as the nation advances toward the polls, the commitment to a polythene-free future is a cornerstone in developing a conscientious and sustainable, smart Bangladesh.

In a notification issued late Monday night, BAJUS announced a price hike of Tk 4,199 per bhori, pushing gold prices to a record level. The new rates will come into effect from Tuesday morning. Under the revised prices, 21-carat gold will cost Tk228,031 per bhori, 18-carat gold Tk195,430 per bhori, while gold under the traditional method has been fixed at Tk160,147 per bhori. BAJUS said the price adjustment was made in view of an increase in the local market price of tejabi gold (pure gold), considering the overall market situation. The association also noted that a mandatory 5% value-added tax (VAT) imposed by the government and a minimum 6% making charge set by BAJUS must be added to the selling price of gold jewellery. However, making charges may vary depending on design and quality. The last price revision took place on January 14, when BAJUS raised the price of 22-carat gold by Tk2,625 per bhori to Tk234,680 — which had been the highest price in the country’s history until now. With the latest adjustment, gold prices have been revised eight times so far in 2026, with six increases and two reductions. In 2025, gold prices were adjusted a total of 93 times — raised on 64 occasions and reduced 29 times. Alongside gold, silver prices have also been increased. The price of 22-carat silver has been raised by Tk291 per bhori to Tk6,240 — the highest level ever recorded in the country. Under the new rates, 21-carat silver will cost Tk5,949 per bhori, 18-carat silver Tk5,132 per bhori, and silver under the traditional method Tk3,849 per bhori.

His stellar performances across international and franchise cricket over the past year helped them earned it. The cricket-focused website's editorial team compiled the XI based on performances in all recognized T20 matches throughout the calendar year, a period packed with international fixtures and franchise leagues leading up to the 2026 World Cup. Wisden highlighted Mustafizur's exceptional discipline, noting that among bowlers who delivered at least 150 overs in 2025, no other bowler came close to his bowling average of 18.03. The publication praised him as the most economical pacer of the year, consistently restricting runs while taking regular wickets. In 2025, Mustafizur claimed 59 wickets in 43 innings with an impressive economy rate of 6.78 and a strike rate of 15.9. He bowled a total of 156.5 overs during the period, with his best figures being 3 for 11. In terms of strike rate, only Caribbean all-rounder Jason Holder (15.4) performed better than Mustafizur among comparable bowlers. The Team of the Year is balanced with two specialist spinners, two pacers, and two pace-bowling all-rounders. Joining Mustafizur in the pace attack is New Zealand’s Jacob Duffy, while Jason Holder and England’s Sam Curran occupy the all-rounder slots.

They were released around 1am on Tuesday. At the same time, students left the protest site after announcing fresh programmes from 10am on Tuesday, university sources said. Speaking briefly to reporters at around 1:30am, Pro-Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr Sazedul Karim said he had returned home but declined to make further comments. University sources said students temporarily withdrew their protest following late-night discussions with Vice-Chancellor Professor Dr AM Sarwar Uddin Chowdhury. Voting in the Shahjalal University of Science and Technology Central Students’ Union (Sucsu) election was scheduled for Tuesday, marking the first election in 28 years. However, the polls were suspended just hours before voting began following a writ petition filed with the High Court, triggering widespread protests on campus. Students blocked the highway and staged demonstrations throughout the day. Protesting students later confined the VC, pro-VC and treasurer inside the administrative building from around noon. Amid the unrest, the VC and pro-VC held a meeting with Sucsu election candidates at around 7:15pm. As no decision was reached, students continued their protest in front of the administrative building. A university syndicate meeting was later held to address the situation. After the meeting, syndicate member and Civil and Environmental Engineering professor Dr Md Jahir Bin Alam said a fresh writ would be filed on Tuesday. “If a verdict is delivered, the election can be held the following day. This issue must be resolved through the court,” he said. He added that syndicate members had consulted four to five senior lawyers, who advised submitting a counter-balance in line with court procedures. “If a verdict is delivered, we are keeping the election commission active to proceed immediately,” he said. “If the verdict comes on Tuesday, the Sucsu election will be held the next day, God willing.

The blaze broke out around 3:45am on Tuesday at the D-4 block of the camp, located in the Shafiullah Kata area of Palongkhali Union. Preliminary reports suggest that a camp resident, Mohammad Anis, had heated water on a gas stove at around 2:45am before falling asleep. The stove remained lit, the water dried up, and a fire broke out, quickly spreading to adjacent shelters. As the incident occurred late at night, the flames spread rapidly, triggering panic throughout the camp. Two units of the Ukhiya Fire Service and Civil Defence rushed to the scene and began firefighting operations, assisted by Rohingya volunteers. After nearly two hours of effort, the fire was brought under control at around 5:30am. Ukhiya Fire Service and Civil Defence Station Officer Dollar Tripura confirmed the incident, saying firefighters responded promptly and managed to contain the blaze with support from volunteers. Mohammad Riaz, community leader of the D block of Camp No 16, said the fire caused extensive damage. According to him, 448 shelters, two mosques, ten schools and one madrasa were completely destroyed. The extent of the financial losses could not be determined immediately. Ukhiya Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Rifat Asma also confirmed the incident, stating that a significant number of shelters and structures were damaged in the fire.

{"title": "Mob pressure forces UAP to sack two teachers", "body": "The removal of the two teachers has sparked widespread criticism on social media The authorities of the private University of Asia Pacific (UAP) have dismissed two teachers following allegations of \"blasphemy\" and \"Awami League sympathiser\" tags. The dismissed teachers are Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir and Associate Professor Dr ASM Mohsin. The university’s Public Relations Officer Sadik Hasan Palash confirmed on Sunday that the two teachers were relieved of their duties. He said: “The students demanded their removal. The university authorities implemented it yesterday.” Among the dismissed teachers, Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir was serving as an assistant professor (Sociology) in the Department of Basic Sciences and Humanities. Dr ASM Mohsin was an associate professor of the same department and also served as its head. According to sources, the two teachers were removed on allegations of blasphemy and being soft sympathisers of the ousted Awami League. However, both teachers have denied the allegations against them. They claim that a powerful section of the university’s senior management orchestrated the move. Students and relevant stakeholders alleged that a \"mob\" was created within the university under the guise of a movement, and the authorities were compelled to remove the two teachers under pressure. They said that for several days, the teachers were targeted and subjected to organized agitation in the name of protest. Sources further said that Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir teaches \"Social History\" a course that includes discussions on the origin and development of different religions. This topic was also allegedly misrepresented. While a section of students accused her of blasphemy, general students claimed that false allegations were brought to frame her at the instigation of a particular group. Demands for her removal were raised citing blasphemy. The removal of the two teachers has sparked widespread criticism on social media. On condition of anonymity, a student said: “Some students claim that a teacher asked a student to remove her niqab to verify her identity. However, since that allegation would not hold, the demand for removal was raised by accusing the teacher of asking a student to remove her hijab.” When contacted, Assistant Professor Layeka Bashir said: “Right-wing students of UAP are carrying out mob intimidation against me to force my removal. Following the Mohammadpur double murder incident involving a masked domestic worker, one of my friends made a Facebook post on December 10. Using that issue, some former students of my university started threatening me online and spreading defamatory content. In that context, on the evening of December 14, the UAP vice-chancellor verbally instructed me to submit my resignation immediately.\" \"The next day, I met the vice-chancellor, pro-vice-chancellor, chairperson of the Board of Trustees, and other senior officials and verbally requested an investigation. Subsequently, the authorities called for fresh complaints and formed an inquiry committee. Despite that, cyberbullying against me continued through some student Facebook pages and groups, branding me as ‘anti-Islam.’ I believe a powerful section of the university’s senior management is using these students as pawns,\" she said. Regarding the blasphemy label, Layeka Bashir wrote on her Facebook account on January 17: “What I wrote earlier about face covering was written from the perspective of personal security. No one was belittled, nor was religious attire questioned. After the Mohammadpur double murder incident, it was my personal opinion as a citizen of the country. It has no connection with my workplace, UAP. The misunderstanding created around this is unfortunate. If anyone’s sentiments were hurt, I sincerely apologise.” On the blasphemy allegation, she said: “After the Mohammadpur double murder incident, I wrote on Facebook as a citizen. It was my personal opinion and has no relation to my workplace. Yet, a mob was created by branding me with the tag of ‘blasphemy’ and demanding my removal.” Associate Professor Dr ASM Mohsin said: “I do not know the exact reason for my removal. I have not yet received any official termination letter. I have heard that I was labelled as a sympathiser of the Awami League. In reality, a mob was created in the name of a movement within the university, and my removal was demanded.” Sources said that Dr Mohsin had expressed soft support for the Awami League on social media. As a result, students demanded his removal by labelling him a sympathiser of the party. The university authorities were compelled to remove him under student pressure. Meanwhile, students of the university had recently demanded the removal of the vice-chancellor as well. Later, stepping back from that demand, some former students first demanded the removal of Layeka Bashir on allegations of blasphemy. Subsequently, they demanded the resignation of Associate Professor Dr ASM Mohsin from the same department. It was also learned that a few months ago, as convenor of the university’s complaint committee, Layeka Bashir investigated a sexual harassment case and proposed disciplinary action. As a result, senior authorities who allegedly supported the accused and misconduct became displeased with her. She has since been targeted, Layeka Bashir said. She added: \"I proposed punishment in a sexual harassment case. I also played a frontline role during the July uprising, which may have caused jealousy among some. Considering my personal safety, I filed a general diary at Tejgaon Police Station on December 22 last year.”", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/401384/two-teachers-dismissed-over-%E2%80%98blasphemy%E2%80%99-and-%E2%80%98awami", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 869}
{"title": "RMG owners ready to pay $0.20 more for local yarn than imported ones", "body": "Currently domestic mills are selling yarn at a price of $0.35 to $0.60 more per kg than imported yarn. However, owners do not object to paying a maximum price of $0.20 more than imported yarn to sustain the domestic industry Even though the price of domestic yarn is up to $0.20 higher than imported yarn, readymade garment (RMG) industry owners are ready to buy it in the interest of the country's industry. However, there is one condition - the bonded warehouse facility cannot be withdrawn for yarn imports without ensuring this price difference. Leaders of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) and Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA) made this demand at a joint press conference organized at the Pan Pacific Sonargaon Hotel in the capital on Monday (January 19). It was informed at the press conference that currently domestic mills are selling yarn at a price of $0.35 to $0.60 more per kg than imported yarn. However, owners do not object to paying a maximum price of $0.20 more than imported yarn to sustain the domestic industry. They expressed concern over the initiative to withdraw the bonded facility before this gap was confirmed. It is learnt that currently, a large part of the export-oriented garment factories is using yarn imported from India. While Bangladeshi spinning mills sell a kilogram of 30-card yarn for about $3, Indian manufacturers are supplying the same quality yarn for $2.60. Due to the comparatively low price, entrepreneurs are leaning towards importing yarn from India, China and Vietnam. BKMEA president Mohammad Hatem said: “If a duty is imposed on yarn imports, it will have a direct negative impact on exports. We are in favor of protecting domestic spinning mills, but if the bonded facility is withdrawn at this time, the ready-made garment industry will be in a major crisis. Exports have been declining for the last six months. This new decision will further push exports.” BGMEA acting president Selim Rahman said in a written statement: “When the industry is in turmoil due to the three-pronged pressure of global market slowdown, geopolitical instability and domestic energy crisis, a suicidal decision like imposing duty on yarn imports has been taken.” He alleged that the Tariff Commission has taken a unilateral decision on this sensitive issue despite garment exporters being the main buyers of domestic spinning mills. He commented that the opinions of the garment industry have been ignored during the discussions. On behalf of BGMEA, he urged the government to immediately withdraw the decision to impose duty on yarn imports. To protect the textile sector, direct cash assistance or special incentives can be given instead of imposing duty on imports. He also recommended ensuring uninterrupted supply of gas and electricity, rationalizing fuel prices, corporate tax rebates for export-oriented spinning mills, and reducing production costs by ensuring easy availability of low-interest loans. BKMEA executive president Fazle Shamim Ehsan, BGMEA senior vice president Enamul Haque Khan, vice president Rezwan Selim, director Faisal Samad, and other leaders of the organizations were also present at the press conference.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/business/401386/rmg-owners-ready-to-pay-0.20-more-for-local-yarn", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 510}

From early morning, thousands of party activists from Dhaka and surrounding districts arrived in processions carrying banners and festoons to pay tribute at the Zia Udyan area. The gathering continued throughout the day, with heavy crowds seen from Bijoy Sarani to the Bailey Bridge and inside the mausoleum complex. At around 11:15am, BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, accompanied by senior leaders including members of the party’s standing committee, placed wreaths at Ziaur Rahman’s grave. They later offered a munajat seeking eternal peace for the departed souls of Ziaur Rahman and former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, who was laid to rest there on December 31 last year. Speaking to reporters after the tribute, Fakhrul expressed confidence in the Election Commission’s ability to hold the upcoming national parliamentary election in a credible manner. “The scrutiny of nomination papers always brings some issues — this is nothing new. So far, we have seen that the Election Commission is working more or less with competence,” he said, adding that the BNP had raised some concerns with the chief election commissioner on Sunday. Asked whether all candidates were receiving equal opportunities, Fakhrul said: “We have no such complaint.” He was joined by BNP Standing Committee members Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan and Salahuddin Ahmed, among others. Also present were BNP Chairperson’s Advisory Council member Nazim Uddin Alam, Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, Joint Secretaries General Khairul Kabir Khokon and Habib-un-Nabi Khan Sohel, as well as central leaders and representatives of various front organisations. Leaders and activists of BNP’s associate and affiliated bodies — including Jubo Dal, Swechchhasebak Dal, Sramik Dal, Mahila Dal, Chhatra Dal, Muktijoddha Dal, Tanti Dal and Matsyajibi Dal — later placed wreaths at the grave in separate processions. Meanwhile, the Nationalist Olama Dal organized a day-long Quran recitation program near the mausoleum. Doctors from the Doctors Association of Bangladesh (DAB) set up medical camps offering free treatment and medicines, while BNP-backed organisations such as JASAS and Zia Parishad also paid tribute. Describing Ziaur Rahman as “an immortal name in the politics of Bangladesh,” Fakhrul said the late president introduced multi-party democracy, ensured freedom of the press and judiciary, and helped transform the country’s economy. “We came to pay tribute to Ziaur Rahman, the proclaimer of Bangladesh’s independence and the architect of modern Bangladesh,” he said. “Beside him rests another extraordinary and indomitable leader, Begum Khaleda Zia, who dedicated her life to democracy, freedom and sovereignty of the country.” Referring to the February 12 election schedule, Fakhrul said the BNP was renewing its commitment to rebuilding the country and institutionalising democracy following what he described as a student-public uprising that ended years of misrule. Ziaur Rahman founded the BNP on September 1, 1978. Born on January 19, 1936, in Gabtali upazila of Bogura, he rose to power following the political upheavals of November 7, 1975, and later served as president. He was assassinated on May 30, 1981, in Chattogram by a group of rebel army officers.

Advocates say the issue has long remained on the margins of election manifestos, despite an estimated five million persons with disabilities living in the country. “Every election, parties speak about development, but our daily struggles never make it into their promises,” said Shahinul Haque Joy, a visually impaired voter and University of Dhaka graduate. “Education, employment, mobility - persons with disabilities are disadvantaged everywhere. This time, we want to see clear commitments, not sympathy.” Political leaders acknowledge the demand but remain guarded about specifics. BNP Standing Committee member Nazrul Islam Khan said disability issues would be reflected in the party’s manifesto, though discussions were still underway. “We are aware of the concerns of persons with disabilities and will include commitments accordingly,” he said, without elaborating on timelines or targets. Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami leader Advocate Ehsanul Mahbub Zubair echoed a similar position. “Our manifesto will include provisions for persons with disabilities. We believe in an inclusive Bangladesh where every citizen enjoys equal facilities,” he said. For activists, however, broad assurances fall short. “Without measurable targets, these promises remain rhetorical,” said Jahangir Alam, senior coordinator at the Centre for Disability in Development (CDD). “Manifestos must address inclusive education, employment quotas, accessible infrastructure and institutional accountability. Otherwise, disability rights will again be sidelined.” Accessibility remains a major concern across sectors. Pushpita Choudhury, a wheelchair user and university student, said the lack of barrier-free environments undermines all policy promises. “You can talk about jobs and education, but if campuses, offices and public transport are inaccessible, those promises mean nothing,” she said. National Citizen Party (NCP) leader Ishtiaq Akib said disability inclusion would be addressed more structurally in his party’s manifesto. “Our focus is on education, skills training, workplace accessibility and correcting errors in social safety net programs,” he said, noting that “more than 50% inclusion errors” currently exist in disability allowance schemes. Employment discrimination also features prominently in the debate. Ali Hossain, convener of the Job-Seeking Graduates with Disabilities Council, said many qualified graduates are excluded from both public and private sector jobs. “If manifestos do not clearly state how persons with disabilities will be employed, an entire generation will remain locked out of the labor market,” he said. Md Abdullah, who has speech and hearing impairments, stressed the absence of institutional support. “There are no sign language interpreters in courts, hospitals or government offices. We are citizens, yet basic services are inaccessible to us,” he said. Salma Mahbub, general secretary of the Bangladesh Society for Change and Advocacy Nexus (BSCAN), said parties must recognize disability rights as a legal and constitutional obligation. “Healthcare, education, infrastructure and participation in policymaking must be clearly addressed in election pledges,” she said. Md Saidul Haque, executive director of Blind Education and Rehabilitation Development Organization (BERDO), summed up the concern: “Persons with disabilities are not beneficiaries of charity. They are rights-holding citizens. If political parties are serious about inclusion, that seriousness must begin with their manifestos.” As campaigning intensifies, rights groups say the coming weeks will show whether political parties are willing to translate words into clear, enforceable commitments - or whether disability rights will once again be relegated to the margins of electoral politics.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/401367/political-parties-silent-on-disability-rights-in", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 574}

Witnesses said the students brought out a procession and gathered at the university main gate around 2:10pm. Later, they blocked the Sylhet–Sunamganj regional highway and chanted slogans saying \"Sucsu is our right, who can stop it\", disrupting traffic movement. Around 5:30pm, the protesters gathered at Gol Chattar area of the university, in front of the administrative building and staged a demonstration. Besides, \"Durbar Sust-ian Oikya\", a panel backed by the Islami Chhatra Shibir and several independent candidates and a large number of general students took part in the protests. Earlier at around 12:30pm, the protesters padlocked the administrative building. Voting for the long-awaited Sucsu election was scheduled to begin at 9am on Tuesday after 28 years. The High Court postponed the election for four weeks after hearing a writ petition filed by an independent candidate. The protesting students also declared the independent candidate Muminur Rashid for VP post as persona no grata. Foysal Hossain, independent candidate for general secretary post, said a petition was filed with the Chamber Court. They also vowed to continue blocking the Sylhet–Sunamganj road until a hearing is held. Earlier around 12:30pm, protesters padlocked the administrative building, keeping Vice-Chancellor Prof AM Sarwaruddin Chowdhury, Pro-Vice-Chancellor Md Sazedul Karim and Treasurer Md Ismail Hossain, confined inside the building. As of 6:30pm, they were still inside, with no official announcement from students on when the blockade would be lifted. Durbar Sustian Oikya Panel candidate Delwar Hasan Shishir said they initially blocked the highway in protest against the court order but later moved inside the campus considering public suffering. “Our only demand is that the SUCSU election must be held tomorrow. Our movement will continue until the demand is met,” he said. Prof Dr Ashraf Uddin, head of the Mathematics Department and president of the Jatiyatabadi Teachers’ Forum, faced verbal abuse when he tried to leave campus through the main gate. Some students chanted slogans such as ‘Bhua bhua’ and \"Dalal dalal\" forcing him to take shelter in a nearby shop. A total of 97 candidates are contesting for 23 posts in the central students’ union election, while 84 candidates are vying for positions in six hall unions, each having nine posts.

{"title": "Allegations of massive irregularities in Kabikha–Kabita projects in Shariatpur", "body": "Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Hafizul Haque said he was aware of the allegations and assured action Serious allegations of corruption and misuse of government funds have surfaced over 79 rural infrastructure development projects under the Kajer Binimoye Khaddo (Kabikha) and Kajer Binimoye Taka (Kabita) programmes in Bhedarganj upazila of Shariatpur. It is alleged that bills amounting to approximately Tk 1.69 crore were withdrawn despite work being partially completed or not carried out at all. Officials concerned have also been accused of demanding commissions during bill disbursements. According to project-related sources, the government allocated funds for rural road construction and infrastructure development in 13 unions of the upazila. Under the Kabikha programme, 61 projects received allocations, including 83.53 metric tons of wheat and 83.53 metric tons of rice. Additionally, over Tk 1.40 crore was allocated for 18 projects under the Kabita programme. Of the total 79 projects, 46 were for construction and reconstruction of kutcha roads, 18 for brick soling, 10 for field filling, and five for construction of ablution facilities and toilets at mosques and khanqahs. However, investigations on the ground revealed that many of the listed roads showed no signs of recent construction or repair. Local residents living alongside several project roads said they were unaware of any work being carried out, despite official records showing the projects as completed. A Union Parishad member, requesting anonymity, alleged that a fixed commission was demanded for bill clearance. “For every Tk 100,000 allocated, Tk 20,000 to Tk 30,000 has to be paid as commission to the PIO, sub-assistant engineer and others. With the remaining amount, proper work is impossible,” the member said. One such project involved the reconstruction of a kutcha road from Gayan Bari Mosque to nearby shops in Ward No. 4 of Uttar Tarabunia Union, for which wheat worth Tk 2.27 lakh was allocated. While the Upazila Project Implementation Office (PIO) claimed the work had been completed, local residents said no earthwork had been done on the road in the last five years. Similar allegations were raised in Ward No. 3 of Dakshin Tarabunia Union, where wheat worth approximately Tk 1.40 lakh was allocated for road construction from Afa Molla Bazar trawler ghat to the house of Gias Uddin Pradhania. Locals said only two labourers worked for a single day clearing roadside grass, after which no further work was done, although the project was officially shown as completed. Union Parishad Chairman Sekandar Khan claimed the work had been carried out in accordance with official procedures and confirmed that he had already withdrawn the bill. He declined further comment and advised journalists to contact the concerned office. Local resident Manik Gayan said no work had been done on the road in the past three to four years. “During the monsoon, we still have to use boats. If the road had been repaired, people would not be preparing boats again this year,” he said. Another resident, Abdus Salam, an auto-rickshaw driver who uses the road daily, said there was no visible evidence of construction. “Even if work was done at night, there should be signs. Everything seems to exist only on paper,” he said. When contacted, Ujjal Mondol, Sub-Assistant Engineer of the Upazila Disaster Management Department, said bills were issued following due procedure and claimed the government would recover money from those who failed to complete work. When asked to provide proof that bills were not issued without work, he reportedly got angry and left the office. Acting PIO Hasan Ahmed said he was overseeing two upazilas simultaneously, which limited proper monitoring. “If anyone has taken money without completing the work, action will be taken in accordance with rules,” he said. Upazila Nirbahi Officer (UNO) Hafizul Haque said he was aware of the allegations and assured action. “Those who withdrew bills without completing the work will be brought under accountability,” he said.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401382/allegations-of-massive-irregularities-in", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 641}

{"title": "Amir Hamza sued in Kushtia, Khulna over defamatory remarks", "body": "According to the complaint, several videos circulating on social media show Mufti Amir Hamza making derogatory comments during a religious sermon Criminal defamation cases have been filed in Kushtia and Khulna against Jamaat-e-Islami–nominated Kushtia-3 candidate Mufti Amir Hamza for allegedly making derogatory remarks about the late Arafat Rahman Koko, younger son of former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia. In Kushtia, the case was filed on Sunday by Solaiman Chowdhury Shihab, joint convener of the Islamic University unit of Chhatra Dal. According to the complaint, several videos circulating on social media show Mufti Amir Hamza making derogatory comments during a religious sermon. He allegedly mocked the name of the late Arafat Rahman Koko and made offensive remarks about Khaleda Zia’s imprisonment during the previous Awami League government. Shihab said he came across the videos on January 16 while near Lalon Shah Hall at Islamic University. The complaint claims the remarks harmed the honour and dignity of Arafat Rahman Koko, Begum Khaleda Zia, and their family. The acts are alleged to be punishable under Sections 500, 501 and 502 of the Penal Code. The plaintiff requested the court to issue a summons or arrest warrant against the accused. Shihab stated that the case was not politically motivated. “Publicly making derogatory remarks about a deceased individual and a former prime minister is unacceptable. As a responsible citizen, I approached the court to uphold social decency and mutual respect,” he said. Advocate Abdul Majid, counsel for the complainant, said the court accepted the case and fixed February 1 for a hearing. “We hope justice will be ensured through legal proceedings,” he added. Contacted, Amir Hamza’s personal assistant Abu Bakr said they had not yet received any notice from the court. “We will take appropriate legal steps once the notice is received,” he said. Earlier, Mufti Amir Hamza claimed on his verified Facebook page that he had received death threats. In the post, he said he was prepared for any eventuality, requested others to take care of his three daughters in his absence, and urged supporters to continue what he described as a struggle for justice in Kushtia. Meanwhile, in Khulna, another defamation case was filed with the court of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate by Md Zahirul Islam Bappi, president of the Khulna Metropolitan unit of the Arafat Rahman Koko Smriti Sangsad. Confirming the matter, plaintiff’s lawyer Advocate Babul Howlader said the court accepted the case and ordered an investigation. The Officer-in-Charge of Sonadanga Model Police Station has been directed to investigate the allegations and submit a report to the court by May 25. According to the Khulna complaint, the plaintiff came across a Facebook video on January 16 while at the office of the Arafat Rahman Koko Smriti Sangsad in the C&B Colony area under Sonadanga Police Station. In the video, the accused allegedly made mocking, offensive and obscene remarks using the name of the late Arafat Rahman Koko, which were later widely circulated on social media. The plaintiff alleged that the comments severely defamed Arafat Rahman Koko, his family, the BNP and its affiliated organisations, as well as leaders and activists of the Smriti Sangsad, causing serious social harm. The complaint states that eyewitnesses and relevant evidence support the allegations and requests the court to take cognisance of the case under Section 500 of the Penal Code and issue an arrest warrant against the accused.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401378/amir-hamza-sued-in-kushtia-khulna-over-defamatory", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 562}

She made the remarks on Sunday at a dialogue titled “Women Shaping the Nation: Policy, Possibility and the Future of Bangladesh”, held at the Krishibid Institution Bangladesh (KIB) Complex in Farmgate, Dhaka. The event brought together around a thousand participants from across the country, including women leaders, professionals, students and young people from diverse sectors. Zaima Rahman, grand daughter of former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, addressed the audience as a special guest, marking her first public or policy-level speech since returning to Bangladesh from London with her father, BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, on December 25. In her speech, Zaima Rahman highlighted the often-overlooked economic contributions of women, saying their role in driving the country’s economy and GDP remains largely invisible. “My mother is a cardiologist and a homemaker. She manages both roles equally,” she said. “My grandmother, Begum Khaleda Zia, led a political party and worked extensively for women’s education and health. Yet women’s contributions to the economy and GDP are still not adequately recognised.” Addressing the issue of online abuse, she said harassment on social media platforms, particularly Facebook, has become a persistent challenge for women who speak up or engage in public discourse. “We are all speaking for the country and its people, and that is the beauty of democracy,” she said, stressing the need for a safer and more inclusive digital space for women. Zaima Rahman emphasised that women’s self-confidence is central to empowerment, arguing that eliminating gender discrimination would significantly boost women’s participation in the economy—an outcome already visible in many developed countries. “If gender discrimination can be removed, women can easily contribute more to GDP,” she said. Recalling a personal anecdote, she shared an incident from London during Khaleda Zia’s medical treatment, where a Nigerian nurse spoke to Tarique Rahman about the former prime minister’s contributions to women’s education, health and advancement in Bangladesh. “That nurse said Nigeria had adopted steps introduced by Begum Khaleda Zia for the development of women,” Zaima Rahman said. The three-hour discussion, held from 3pm to 6pm, focused on key issues including women’s empowerment and safety, economic participation and entrepreneurship, pathways to leadership, and the policy frameworks required for sustainable development.

{"title": "What we know about Syria president’s deal with Kurds", "body": "Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa announced an agreement with Kurdish fighters on Sunday, after launching an offensive against areas under their control in the country’s north and east. The 14-point agreement provides for a ceasefire between the Syrian army and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). Here’s what we know about the deal: The agreement stipulates the integration of the Kurdish forces -- numbering nearly 100,000, according to the Kurds -- into the Syrian army and security forces. The two sides had signed an agreement in March to integrate Kurdish civil and military institutions into the state, but failed to agree on its implementation. Under Sunday’s deal, the SDF will be integrated into the defense ministry while the Kurdish security forces will join the interior ministry. But while the Kurds had insisted during negotiations that their forces remain in separate units based in their areas, the latest agreement stipulates they will be integrated “on an individual basis”. The fate of the all-female Women’s Protection Units was unclear, as the Syrian army and security forces do not include women. Sharaa said on Sunday that “in certain sensitive regions, the security personnel will be from those regions in order to prevent tensions.” The agreement stipulates that the Kurds will immediately hand over to the government the administration of the Deir Ezzor and Raqa provinces, which are predominantly populated by Arabs and have been under Kurdish control. The Syrian government is also taking immediate control of border posts and oil and gas fields throughout Kurdish-controlled territory. The text also outlines the “integration of all civil institutions” in the Kurds’ stronghold of Hasakeh province into the state. Sharaa is set to issue a decree appointing a governor for the province -- likely to be Kurdish. The SDF leadership will submit candidates for “senior military, security and civil positions.” The agreement also stipulates that the Syrian state will become responsible for Islamic State group prisoners. Supported by the United States, the SDF spearheaded the fight against IS, and the group’s defeat in Syria in 2019 enabled the Kurdish-led fighters to take control of more territory. Years after the defeat of IS, camps and prisons run by the Kurdish administration in northeast Syria still house tens of thousands of suspected fighters and their relatives, including many foreigners. The deal is a major blow to Kurdish hopes to preserve the de facto autonomous administration built during Syria’s civil war, including institutions that administered and controlled parts of the north and northeast. The agreement also ends Kurdish aspirations for decentralized rule, despite their earlier insistence on the issue during negotiations with Damascus. Before announcing the deal, Sharaa issued a decree on Friday recognizing the national rights of the Kurdish minority, making their language official and granting Syrian nationality to some members who had been deprived of it in the past. The Kurds said the announcement fell short of their expectations.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/middle-east/401372/what-we-know-about-syria-president%E2%80%99s-deal-with", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 481}

So, the Chinese ambassador said that they are scrutinizing this project very well so that they can complete the work without any mistake as the people of Bangladesh have high expectations for this project. “The Teesta Master Plan is a relatively complex project as it includes flood control, river erosion prevention and irrigation activities. Therefore, various issues are being analyzed. As a result, China is taking some time to prove its feasibility,” she said. She said China is friendly with Bangladesh. The main thing in Bangladesh's foreign policy is friendship. Since China is a neighboring country, our relations with them are close. China also has relations with Bangladesh's rivers,” she added. “In addition, China has come forward to build a big hospital. For this, I am grateful to them. The future of the Teesta Master Plan is very bright because this work was not left behind by the interim government,” she said. The adviser said that political parties have pledged to implement this project. Therefore, disappointment cannot be spread, she said, adding that if an agreement is reached after a study, the money we pay is very difficult to change if more money is needed later. “Therefore, let's go through a process that is tolerable for both countries and good for the people,” she said. Rizwana said that achieving a fair share of Teesta river water is an ongoing process. Besides, it is a big political issue. “So, we think that the elected government will come and work to achieve a fair share of water. We have made preparations in the case of the Ganges and the Teesta so that they do not have to wait for the elected government to come,\" she said. At that time, Chinese Ambassador Mr Yao Wen, Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Enamul Ahsan, Director of Riverine People Professor Dr Tuhin Wadud, Executive Engineer of Water Development Board Rabiul Islam and others were present. Earlier, the adviser with the Chinese ambassador and high officials visited the Teesta Road Bridge and Railway Bridge built on the river Teesta in Kawnia upazila of Rangpur. During the visit, Rangpur Water Development Board Executive Engineer Md Rabiul Islam highlighted the nature and crisis of the Teesta River, which is surrounded by five districts in northern Bangladesh.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401371/rizwana-china-wants-to-start-teesta-master-plan", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 583}

According to the PBI, 15-year-old Milon Hossain was kidnapped and strangled to death after his auto-rickshaw was taken, reportedly for financial gain. The main planner of the crime, along with two accomplices, has been arrested, and the stolen auto-rickshaw recovered. The details were disclosed by PBI Superintendent of Police MN Morshed at a press conference on Monday at the PBI Dhaka District office in Uttara. SP Morshed said Milon went missing on the afternoon of September. 29 after leaving home with his auto-rickshaw. Following an extensive search, Milon’s mother, Josna Begum, filed a kidnapping case at Ashulia Police Station on November 18. On December 1, police recovered unidentified skeletal remains and clothing from a bamboo grove in Ashulia Model Town. Milon’s relatives later identified him from the clothing. Pursuant to a court order, PBI Dhaka District took over the investigation on January 1. “PBI investigations revealed that on the day of the incident, the accused, Suman and Roni Mia, rented Milon’s auto-rickshaw and took it to Akran Bazar. From there, they lured him to a deserted bamboo grove in Ashulia Model Town. There, they consumed marijuana together and ultimately strangled Milon to death, leaving his body in the bamboo grove before fleeing with the auto-rickshaw,” SP Morshed said. On the night of January 16, PBI conducted an operation and arrested the main suspect, Md Roni Mia, 24, from Akran Bazar in Savar. Based on information provided by him, Md Ershad Ali, 34, involved in buying and selling the auto-rickshaw, and Md. Abul Kalam, 52, owner of an auto-rickshaw garage, were also arrested. During initial questioning, the suspects admitted selling the auto-rickshaw for Tk 62,000 and repainting it to avoid detection. They also provided confessions under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code in court, SP Morshed added. The PBI said the other accused, Suman, was arrested by local police and was currently in custody.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/crime/401370/savar-teen-murder-38-pieces-of-skeleton", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 353}

Cadman’s one-year contract, which began in September 2024, expired on November 26, 2025, and was not renewed. He has not performed any duties since that date. Cadman formally informed Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus of his decision, said Tribunal Prosecutor Gazi MH Tamim on Monday. British journalist David Bergman shared on Facebook that Cadman acknowledged his contract had ended in November. While an extension was offered, he declined and said commenting on the reasons for his resignation would not be “appropriate” at this time. Cadman’s departure comes as the prosecution’s appeal seeking to upgrade former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s sentence from life imprisonment to the death penalty in a July uprising-related crimes against humanity case awaits a Supreme Court hearing. On November 17 last year, Tribunal-1 sentenced Sheikh Hasina and Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal to life imprisonment in one case and the death penalty in another. Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam, deeming the life sentence “inadequate in proportion to the crimes,” filed an appeal on December 15. Under legal requirements, appeals must be filed within 30 days and disposed of within 60 days; the application was submitted urgently. The Supreme Court full bench is scheduled to hear the appeal Tuesday. Cadman, joint head of London-based law firm Guernica 37, previously worked on Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal judicial process in 2011.

{"title": "US warns Bangladeshi applicants against advance visa bond payments", "body": "It notes that a bond would be returned only if the visa holder fully complies with its terms The US Embassy today cautioned Bangladeshi visa applicants against paying any visa bond before interviews, warning that advance payments neither guarantee visa approval nor protect applicants from fraud or scams. In a statement posted on its verified Facebook page today, the embassy said paying a bond in advance does not ensure a visa and noted that third-party websites offering such services may be fraudulent. “Paying early does not guarantee you a visa, and third-party sites can be scams,” the embassy said, adding that any payment made before a visa interview is non-refundable. It noted that a bond would be returned only if the visa holder fully complies with its terms. The warning comes ahead of a new US policy set to take effect on January 21, under which Bangladeshi citizens approved for B1/B2 (business or tourist) visas will be required to post a bond up to $15,000. The requirement will not apply to holders of valid B1/B2 visas issued before that date. Earlier this month, the administration of US President Donald Trump added 25 more countries, including Bangladesh, to a list of nations whose citizens may be required to post entry bonds, Reuters reported on January 6, citing the US State Department website. According to the website, eligible B1/B2 visa applicants from the listed countries may be required to post a bond of $5,000, $10,000 or $15,000, with the amount determined during the visa interview. Applicants must agree to the bond conditions and make payments exclusively through the US Treasury Department’s official online platform, Pay.gov, the state department said. The expanded list now covers 38 countries, mostly from Africa, Latin America and South Asia. US authorities said the bond requirement aims to deter visitors from overstaying visas issued for tourism or business purposes.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/foreign-affairs/401364/us-warns-bangladeshi-applicants-against-advance", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 311}

{"title": "Speakers: High-quality evidence key to reducing poverty among persons with disabilities", "body": "Globally, 1.3 billion people live with disabilities, a group more likely to experience both monetary, multidimensional poverty Generating robust evidence on effective strategies to reduce poverty among persons with disabilities is essential for promoting their economic inclusion, speakers said at the International Conference on Economic Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities. The two-day conference, held at the BRAC Centre in Mohakhali, was jointly organized by the BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD), the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), and the Program for Evidence to Inform Disability Action (PENDA) on Sunday. Globally, an estimated 1.3 billion people live with disabilities, a group consistently more likely to experience both monetary and multidimensional poverty. Persons with disabilities often face exclusion from education and decent work, alongside additional disability-related costs that existing social protection and development programs inadequately address. On the first day of the conference, speakers highlighted the lack of robust evidence from low- and middle-income countries, including Bangladesh, on strategies that effectively reduce poverty and improve employment outcomes for persons with disabilities. Delivering the keynote address, Dr. Morgan Banks, Associate Professor of Disability Research at the International Centre for Evidence in Disability (ICED) at LSHTM, said excluding adults with disabilities from the labor force results in economic losses ranging from 1% to 8% of GDP across 12 countries. She noted that in Bangladesh, youth with disabilities are five times more likely to be out of both school and work compared to peers without disabilities. She, however, stressed that reliable evidence—both nationally and globally—on interventions that successfully improve employment outcomes for persons with disabilities remains extremely limited. Dr. Banks emphasized the importance of targeted research and training programs in expanding opportunities for unemployed and impoverished youth with disabilities. Citing BRAC’s STAR+ program, she said participation increased the likelihood of employment among young people with disabilities by 22%. Speakers warned that without robust evidence, efforts by governments, development practitioners, and donors to promote economic inclusion are less likely to deliver meaningful or cost-effective results, underscoring the need for a shift in how disability inclusion is understood and practiced. “Inclusivity is not about defining people by what they lack; it is about recognizing where they can contribute,” said Dr. Syed Ferhat Anwar, Vice-Chancellor of BRAC University. “When barriers or gaps are appropriately addressed, their ability to contribute grows even further.” Tahera Jabeen, Social Development adviser at the British High Commission, reiterated the UK’s commitment to disability-inclusive development. “Through the Program for Evidence to Inform Disability Action (PENDA), we are investing in high-quality evidence that partners and policymakers can use to strengthen access to education, skills, and livelihoods for persons with disabilities in Bangladesh and around the world,” she said. The conference brings together academics, practitioners, policymakers, donors, persons with disabilities, and their representative organizations to share evidence-based strategies on improving livelihoods, reducing poverty, and strengthening cross-sector collaboration on economic inclusion.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/event/401355/speakers-quality-evidence-key-to-reducing-poverty", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 478}
{"title": "Trump says world not secure until US has Greenland", "body": "Donald Trump no longer needs to think “purely of peace” after being snubbed for a Nobel, the US president said in comments published Monday, adding the world will not be safe until Washington controls Greenland. Trump has put the transatlantic alliance to the test with threats to take over Greenland “one way or the other,” with European countries closing ranks against Washington’s designs on the vast Danish territory. German and French leaders denounced as “blackmail” weekend threats by Trump to wield new tariffs against countries that oppose his plans for the Arctic island, and said Monday that Europe was preparing trade countermeasures. The European Union said it was holding an emergency summit on Thursday to weigh its response, and that while its priority is to “engage not escalate” it is ready to act if needed. Greenland, for its part, said the tariffs threat does not change its desire to assert its own sovereignty. “We will not be pressured,” Greenlandic prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post, adding that the autonomous territory “is a democratic society with the right to make its own decisions.” But Trump had earlier doubled down, announcing in a message to Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store that the world “is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.” The message -- published Monday and whose authenticity was confirmed to AFP by Store’s office -- also saw Trump brush aside peace as a primary goal. “I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” he said, citing his failure to win the last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, despite openly coveting it. He said although peace would still be “predominant,” he could “now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.” Store said the statement had been received in response to a message from him and Finnish President Alexander Stubb, where they had “conveyed our opposition” to Trump’s tariff threats. Store also underlined that the Nobel Peace Prize was not awarded by the Norwegian government. “I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known -- the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee,” he said in a written statement. Trump has repeatedly said his country needs vast, mineral-rich Greenland for “national security,” despite the United States already having a base on the island and security agreements with fellow Nato ally Denmark. “Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,” Trump said in his message to the Norwegian premier, doubling down on that sentiment in a post to Truth Social on Monday. Denmark’s defense minister Troels Lund Poulsen said Monday steps had already been taken along with Nato allies to “increase military presence and training activity in the Arctic and the North Atlantic.” Lund Poulsen added that he and Greenlandic foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt would be meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte later on Monday. This weekend, Trump said that from February 1, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland would be subject to a 10% tariff on all goods sent to the United States -- a duty which could go higher. Germany’s vice chancellor Lars Klingbeil slammed the move as blackmail, and said Monday that Europe was preparing countermeasures. French finance minister Roland Lescure, speaking at a press conference alongside Kingbeil, agreed. “Blackmail between allies of 250 years, blackmail between friends, is obviously unacceptable,” Lecurse said. Klingbeil said Europe’s response could have three main strands. First, the current tariff deal with the United States would be put on hold, he said. Second, European tariffs on imports from the United States, currently suspended until early February, could come into force. And thirdly the EU should consider using its toolbox of instruments against “economic blackmail,” he added. Europe’s stock markets fell as the week’s trading began Monday, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer warning that a “trade war is in no one’s interest.” Greenland -- whose tiny population of 57,000 has voiced disquiet at Trump’s threats -- continued to make its preferences clear Monday. Greenland’s dog sled federation said that the new US special envoy to the Arctic island had been disinvited to its annual race. Jeff Landry had been invited to attend the race by a private Greenlandic tour operator, an invite the Knqk federation has previously called “totally inappropriate.”", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/401361/trump-says-world-not-secure-until-us-has-greenland", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 723}

Speaking at a press conference at the party’s temporary office in Banglamotor, NCP spokesperson Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan said the party does not want to rely on money from loan defaulters or business groups. “We do not want to enter parliament with funds from loan defaulters or businessmen. We want to go with the people’s money and remain accountable to the public,” he said. Asif added that while NCP candidates had previously raised election funds individually, the party is now introducing a centralized crowdfunding system through a designated website. Donors can contribute either to the party as a whole or to individual candidates. Contributions will start from a minimum of Tk 10, allowing people to give according to their capacity. “Those who can afford more may give more, but we do not intend to accept large sums from a single individual. Our goal is broader public participation,” he said. The party plans to disclose the funds publicly through annual audits. “Unlike the BNP, we will not contest elections with thousands of crores of taka from loan defaulters. We have only a handful of wealthy candidates. Accountability is our core principle,” Asif added. When asked whether donations would be returned if NCP decides not to participate in the election, Asif declined to comment, saying no final decision has been made. “We wanted to hold the Election Commission accountable. If that does not happen, we will take a considered decision.” Rejecting allegations of corruption against him, Asif challenged his accusers to provide proof. “If anyone can prove I am corrupt, I will accept whatever punishment is imposed. If corruption by a powerful party like the Awami League can come to light, proving allegations against me would not be difficult if they were true,” he said. He also warned that what he described as ‘false’ corruption allegations could target NCP leaders in the coming days and urged party members to remain vigilant.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/401359/ncp-launches-centralized-crowdfunding-ahead-of", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 364}
{"title": "Tarique Rahman: Politics must move beyond decades of blame", "body": "Tarique said true politics is about easing people’s suffering, not merely criticizing rivals from public platforms BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman on Monday called for a shift in Bangladesh’s political culture, saying politics must move beyond decades of blame and confrontation and focus instead on improving the lives of ordinary people. “Those of us in politics—who do we serve? We serve the people of this country. Standing beside them in times of need is the highest form of politics,” he said while virtually addressing a program in Jessore. The event saw BNP provide financial assistance to three-year-old Afia, a child born with albinism, a genetic condition. Tarique said true politics is about easing people’s suffering, not merely criticizing rivals from public platforms. “If politics is only about blaming one another, it does not fill people’s stomachs. Politics must be about what helps people live better lives,” he added. Referring to decades of confrontational politics, he said: “We have followed a certain style of politics for many years. Now we need to change it. We want to take politics closer to people’s welfare.” The BNP chairman highlighted that political work should include support during natural disasters, personal crises, and social hardships. Afia and her mother, he noted, have faced severe difficulties after her father rejected the child and accused her mother of infidelity. “No child should face discrimination or suffering because of a genetic condition. There are many Afias in Bangladesh and many helpless mothers like her. They are also children of this country, and we must think about them,” Tarique said. He said BNP aims to support vulnerable people as part of its commitment to people-centered politics. “As we stand beside Afia today, we want to stand beside every helpless person in the country.” Tarique also outlined several BNP initiatives should the party come to power through the next election. These include: “Insha’Allah, when BNP forms government in the coming days, just as Begum Khaleda Zia always stood beside you, so too will her party, BNP, stand firmly beside you,” he said. Tarique concluded: “If we truly want to build the Bangladesh we aspire to, we must move forward with this oath and the slogan: ‘We will work and build the country, Bangladesh first.”", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/401358/tarique-rahman-politics-must-move-beyond-decades", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 373}

He made the call in a video message to the nation on Monday. “The key to building a new Bangladesh is now in your hands,” Yunus said in the message. “If you stamp ‘Yes,’ the door to building a new Bangladesh will open. Cast the stamp yourself. Encourage everyone you know to do the same and take them to the polling center. Change the country. In Sha Allah, together we will seize this opportunity to build the nation.” Yunus described the July mass uprising as “an extraordinary achievement in the nation’s history,” noting that it unexpectedly created an opportunity to establish democracy, justice, and human rights. “To this end, we have already implemented several reforms. For deeper and far-reaching changes, the July Charter was formulated with consensus among all political parties. Your consent is required for its implementation. A referendum has been arranged for this purpose. Participate in it and give your consent to the charter,” he said. He also noted that the referendum will be held on the same day as the national parliamentary elections. “By voting ‘Yes’ in the referendum, Bangladesh will be freed from inequality, exploitation, and oppression. Voting ‘Yes’ means the caretaker government and the Election Commission will be formed through cooperation between the government and the opposition. The government will not be able to amend the Constitution at will. Significant changes will require public consent. “Deputy speakers and chairpersons of key parliamentary committees will be elected from the opposition. No individual will be able to serve as Prime Minister for more than 10 years. The judiciary will operate independently. Women’s representation in parliament will increase. An upper chamber will be established to maintain the balance of power. Your fundamental rights will be further protected. “In addition to the state language Bengali, the languages of other ethnic groups will receive constitutional recognition.

Families rushed to the Gul Plaza building after the blaze erupted on Saturday night at one of the coastal city’s busiest malls, where dozens of people were still missing. “In total 21 bodies have been recovered,” Hassan Khan, spokesman for the Rescue 1122 Sindh emergency service, told AFP. “The search operation will continue,” he said. The dead include a 25-year-old rescuer, Khan said, while at least 30 injured people were hospitalized. Standing outside the burnt mall, Shehbaz Ghulam said his nephew’s whereabouts were unknown. “We have made requests to the authorities. We also request the media to help us in any way possible,” the 45-year-old said. “No matter what condition he is in, if he is found and returned to us, we will find some peace,” he told AFP. The top police officer in Karachi’s southern district, Syed Asad Raza, told AFP the force has “a list of 60 missing persons.” Rescue workers said that the blaze had been brought under control. A government committee has launched an investigation, but it was not immediately clear what had caused the fire Among those waiting outside the mall was Muhammad Qaisar, who last heard from his wife, sister and daughter-in-law at 8pm on Saturday. “The phone kept ringing until 10pm, but no one answered. It continued to ring until midnight, but no one picked up,” Qaisar, 55, told AFP. The three-storey shopping mall housed at least 1,200 shops, offering a wide range of goods and was famous for wedding shopping and home decoration items.

{"title": "High-speed train collision in Spain kills 39, injures dozens", "body": "A high-speed train has derailed and been hit by another in southern Spain killing at least 39 people and injuring more than 120, authorities said on Monday. It said the country’s worst train crash in over a decade was “extremely strange.” This was the deadliest train accident since 2013, when 80 people died after a train veered off a curved section of track outside the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela. The crash happened on Sunday evening when a train operated by rail company Iryo travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz in Andalucia. It crossed onto the other track, where it crashed into an oncoming train, which also derailed. Transport Minister Oscar Puente said at least 39 people died, warning this toll was “not definitive” and could still rise. “I want to express my deepest gratitude for the tremendous work of the rescue teams throughout the night, under very difficult circumstances,” he added on X. Around 123 other people were injured, including five very seriously and 24 seriously, the interior ministry said. Unlike the 2013 accident, the derailment took place on a straight part of the track which had been completely renovated, Puente told reporters. The first train to derail was “practically new,” making the accident “extremely strange” and “very difficult to explain,” he said. Rail experts “are very surprised by this accident,” he added. Train operator Iryo said the locomotive was built in 2022 and last inspected on January 15, adding it “veered onto the adjacent track for still unknown reasons.” The company said around 300 people were on board its service from the Andalucian city of Malaga to the capital, Madrid. Renfe, the operator of the second train, has not said how many passengers were on the service, which was travelling to the southern city of Huelva. Spain has Europe’s largest high-speed rail network, with more than 3,000 kilometers of dedicated tracks connecting major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia and Malaga. Emergency services said they struggled to free the hundreds of passengers trapped in the wreckage. “The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,” Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Cordoba, told public broadcaster RTVE. “We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,” he added. A passenger on the second train who gave only her first name, Montse, told Spanish public television the train, jolted, “came to a complete stop and everything went dark.” She described being thrown around in the carriage at the back end of the train and seeing luggage tumble onto other passengers. “The attendant behind me hit her head and was bleeding. There were children crying,” she added. “Luckily, I was in the last car. I feel like I was given a second chance at life.” Survivor Lucas Meriako, who was travelling on the Iryo train, told La Sexta television: “This looks like a horror movie.” “We felt a very strong hit from behind and the feeling that the whole train was about to collapse... There were many injured due to the glass,” he said. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was to visit the site of the disaster later on Monday, his office said. “Today is a night of deep pain for our country owing to the tragic rail accident in Adamuz,” he wrote on X on Sunday night, adding: “No words can alleviate such great suffering.” The royal palace said on X that King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were following the news “with great concern”. The monarchs offered “our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,” the palace said. French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were among the world leaders offering condolences.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/401354/high-speed-train-collision-in-spain-kills-39", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 649}

{"title": "150 candidates dropped from 13th Parliamentary Election race", "body": "The EC and returning officers cancelled these nominations citing various reasons A total of 150 candidates have been disqualified from the 13th national parliamentary election following scrutiny, appeals, and hearings conducted by the Election Commission (EC). The election, along with a referendum, is scheduled for February 12. According to EC officials, the cancellations were due to a range of issues, including discrepancies in nomination papers, loan defaults, pending criminal cases, dual citizenship, failure to submit required documents, and inability to secure the mandatory 1% voter support. Of the disqualified candidates, 98 were independents, while the remainder represented various political parties. These included four Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) nominees, four BNP rebel candidates, one Jamaat-e-Islami nominee, 21 Jatiya Party candidates, and 22 from other parties. BNP candidates whose nominations were cancelled include Munjurul Ahsan Munshi (Comilla-4), TS Ayub (Jessore-4), Sarwar Alamgir (Chittagong-2), and Abdul Gafur Bhuiyan (Comilla-10). BNP rebel candidates affected were Md Shafiqul Islam (Sirajganj-6), Md Saiful Islam (Mymensingh-6), Md Mobasher Alam Bhuiyan (Comilla-10), and Md Mofiqul Hasan Tripti (Jessore-1). The lone Jamaat-e-Islami nominee to lose candidacy was Dr AKM Fazlul Haque from Chittagong-9. Notable Jatiya Party candidates disqualified after appeal hearings include Mohammad Israfil Mia (Gazipur-2), Nurul Islam Milon (Comilla-8), Md Mujibul Haque (Kishoreganj-3), and SM Abdul Mannan (Manikganj-2). After the hearings, Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin dismissed allegations of bias. “Many may criticize us, but we did not show any bias while hearing appeals against returning officers’ decisions,” he said. He added that the EC had shown flexibility regarding the 1% voter support requirement for independent candidates. “We want everyone to participate in a good and inclusive election. Neither I nor my team made biased judgments,” he said. EC sources said 3,406 nomination papers were collected, of which 2,568 were submitted. Following initial scrutiny, 723 were rejected, and 1,842 were found valid. Dhaka saw the highest number of rejections (133), while Barisal recorded the lowest (31). Between December 30 and January 4, a total of 645 appeals were filed. After nine consecutive days of hearings beginning January 10, the EC restored 414 candidacies, bringing the total number of valid candidates to 2,257. Despite the EC’s stance, some parties have announced plans to challenge the decisions in court. Jatiya Party Secretary General Shamim Haider Patwary said, “We will file writ petitions for those candidates whose appeals have been rejected.” EC officials said most independent candidates were disqualified due to irregularities in collecting and verifying the required 1% voter signatures. Others were disqualified for loan defaults, dual citizenship, or failure to disclose information in affidavits. The commission, they noted, applied the law strictly but more flexibly than in previous elections. Election activities in Pabna-1 and Pabna-2 were postponed due to boundary complications. On January 15, the EC announced a revised schedule: nomination papers can be submitted until January 18, scrutiny will take place on January 19, appeals will be heard between January 20 and 25, and the final list of candidates will be published on January 27.

{"title": "Bangladesh’s first ‘Adaptation Fortress’ to protect communities from heatwaves, cyclones", "body": "If the pilot is successful, the initiative could expand to 1,250 Adaptation Fortresses across the region, offering heatwave relief to half a million residents For the first time in Bangladesh, a cyclone shelter is being designed not only to protect communities from storms but also to provide relief during extreme heat. The Jameel Observatory Climate Resilience Early Warning System Network (CREWSnet), a collaboration between MIT and Community Jameel, has begun construction of the pilot “Adaptation Fortress” in Baradal Aftab Uddin Collegiate School in Satkhira’s Assasuni sub-district, in partnership with BRAC. The Adaptation Fortress will transform an existing school and cyclone shelter into a safe and cool refuge during heatwaves, which are becoming increasingly frequent and severe in southwestern Bangladesh. Solar panels with battery backup will ensure continuous electricity for cooling even during power outages. Rainwater harvesting and a system to share excess energy with the community will make the shelter a local hub for resilience and wellbeing. If the pilot is successful, the initiative could expand to 1,250 Adaptation Fortresses across the region, offering heatwave relief to half a million residents. A second pilot location has already been chosen at Satbaria High School in Jashore district. Mohammed Abdul Latif Jameel KBE, founder and chairman of Community Jameel, said , “The Jameel Observatory-CREWSnet’s construction of this first pilot Adaptation Fortress marks a milestone for Bangladesh and the region. It lays the foundation for a proactive response to cyclones and heat stress - emergencies that the team has projected will become frequent events, threatening the lives of millions in Bangladesh. By adapting infrastructure today, we are building the resilience needed for tomorrow.” Professor Elfatih Eltahir, lead principal investigator of the Jameel Observatory-CREWSnet, said, “Bangladesh built a vast network of cyclone shelters that have been effective in protecting vulnerable population. For the first time the Jameel Observatory-CREWSnet is introducing the concept of shelter from heatwaves as well as cyclones in southwest Bangladesh. This integrated and proactive initiative will significantly improve climate resilience in a region with some of the highest risks from climate change.\" Dr Deborah Campbell, executive director of the Jameel Observatory-CREWSnet, said, “Bangladesh is getting hotter and will experience more frequent and severe heatwaves, leaving many people very vulnerable to heat stress and lacking the resources to adapt. The Adaptation Fortress initiative will provide shelter for the most vulnerable community members in southwest Bangladesh and has the potential to serve as a model for similar proactive climate resilience infrastructure development across Bangladesh and South Asia.” Dr Md Liakath Ali, principal investigator of the Jameel Observatory-CREWSnet at BRAC, said, “BRAC is proud to partner with the Jameel Observatory-CREWSnet in pioneering the Adaptation Fortress initiative, an important step toward protecting vulnerable communities from the growing risks of extreme heat in coastal Bangladesh. By transforming existing cyclone shelters into multi-purpose, climate-resilient infrastructure, we are demonstrating how locally grounded solutions can address emerging climate hazards while strengthening community wellbeing. Alongside the pilot, we are committed to engaging policy makers so that future heat and climate risks are integrated into national planning processes. The lessons from this initiative will not only support communities in the southwest, but also inform long-term, scalable strategies for resilience across the country.” Southwestern Bangladesh is home to more than 30 million people who face growing climate risks. Between 2019 and 2021, multiple cyclones caused widespread damage to homes and livelihoods. Rising temperatures now add another threat, with heatwaves disrupting schools, health services, and daily life. The Adaptation Fortress aims to protect the most vulnerable residents from both cyclones and extreme heat while serving as a blueprint for climate-resilient infrastructure. The pilot shelter’s effectiveness will be assessed using community feedback, energy monitoring, and local weather data to inform the potential expansion of Adaptation Fortresses across the region and beyond.

Combined with a death rate of 8.04 per 1,000, the overall population of what was once the most populous nation on earth has fallen to around 1.404 billion — around 3 million less than the previous year. The population of India surpassed that of China back in 2023 and currently stands at approximately 1.464 billion people. At this rate, the Chinese population could shrink to around 800 million by the year 2100, according to calculations made by the United Nations.

{"title": "Chile declares emergency as wildfires kill at least 19", "body": "Uncontrolled wildfires tore through communities in southern Chile, leaving charred ruins in their wake and at least 19 dead, authorities said, announcing the latest toll on Sunday. More than 50,000 people have been displaced by blazes burning for two days now in the Nuble and Biobio regions about 500 kilometers south of Santiago, fanned by strong winds and hot weather. “At 2:30 in the morning, the fire was out of control. There was a whirlwind of fire that consumed the houses in the town below,” Matias Cid, a 25-year-old student in Penco, told AFP. “We had to leave with the shirts on our back. If we had stayed another 20 minutes we would have burned to death,” he said. Video of the aftermath shows a bleak, empty cityscape of charred homes and burned-out pick-up trucks and cars. Most of the fatalities from the wildfires in the region have so far been in Penco, Mayor Rodrigo Vera said. In neighboring Lirquen, a small port town of about 20,000, the scene was equally devastating, with residents describing how the fire advanced “in seconds.” Many of the residents “were saved from the fire because they ran to the beach,” Alejandro Arredondo, 57, told AFP. “Nothing was left standing.” In the town of Lirquen, soldiers were patrolling the streets as night fell on Sunday. Despite a curfew, some residents armed with flashlights continued working to clear debris or put out fires. President Gabriel Boric declared a state of emergency in Nuble and Biobio as nearly 4,000 firefighters battled the wildfires -- raging during the high temperatures of the southern hemisphere summer. The order allows for the deployment of the armed forces to assist. The president traveled to the badly impacted city of Concepcion to oversee the firefighting efforts. Boric announced a nighttime curfew in the most affected towns, warning, “conditions are very difficult.” He returned to Santiago in the evening, pledging to meet with president-elect Jose Antonio Kast on Monday to share information about the forest fires. “In difficult times, Chile is united. Our government and the president-elect will work together,” he said. Alicia Cebrian, the director of the National Service for Disaster Prevention and Response, said most of the evacuations were in the Biobio towns of Penco and Lirquen, which have a combined population of around 60,000 people. The weather forecast Sunday was bad for firefighters -- high temperatures and strong winds, said Esteban Krause, the head of a forest preservation agency in Biobio. Wildfires have severely impacted south-central Chile in recent years amid growing signs of the impact of climate change in the South American country, including extreme weather, droughts and floods. In February 2024, several fires broke out simultaneously near the city of Vina del Mar, northwest of Santiago, resulting in 138 deaths, according to the public prosecutor’s office. About 16,000 people were affected by those fires, authorities said.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/latin-america/401340/chile-declares-emergency-as-wildfires-kill-at", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 478}

So far, we have seen that the Election Commission is working more or less with competence,” he said while talking to reporters after placing a wreath at the grave of former President and BNP founder Ziaur Rahman at Sher-e-Bangla Nagar. Fakhrul said their party placed a few of its concerns before the chief election commissioner on Sunday. “We believe this Election Commission will be able to conduct the election with competence.” Asked whether all candidates are getting equal opportunities in the polls, the BNP Secretary General replied, “We have no such complaint.” Fakhrul along with BNP Standing Committee members Mirza Abbas, Gayeshwar Chandra Roy, Dr Abdul Moyeen Khan and Salahuddin Ahmed placed the wreath at Zia’s grave, marking his 90th Birth Anniversary. They later offered a munajat seeking eternal peace for the departed souls of Zia and Begum Khaleda Zia who were buried there on December 31 last year. BNP Chairperson’s Advisory Council member Nazim Uddin Alam, Senior Joint Secretary General Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, Joint Secretaries General Khairul Kabir Khokon and Habib-un-Nabi Khan Sohel, and central leaders Mir Sarafat Ali Sapu, Rafiqul Islam, Mir Newaz Ali, Helen Zerin Khan, Shah Nesarul Haque and SM Jahangir were also present, along with leaders of different front organisations. Later, leaders of the BNP’s different associate bodies, including Metropolitan units, Jubo Dal, Swechchasebak Dal, Mohila Dal, Muktijoddha Dal, Chhatra Dal, Tanti Dal, Matsyajibi Dal also placed wreaths at the grave. Fakhrul said they came to the grave of Zia, the proclaimer of Bangladesh’s independence, the architect of modern Bangladesh and promoter of multi-party democracy, to pay tribute to him, marking his 90th birth anniversary. “Beside him rests another extraordinary and indomitable leader, Begum Khaleda Zia, who dedicated her life to democracy, freedom and sovereignty of Bangladesh,” he said. Calling Zia “an immortal name in the politics of Bangladesh,” Fakhrul said the late president introduced multi-party democracy, ensured freedom of press and judiciary and transformed the country’s economy from a ‘bottomless basket’ to a growing economy. “We remember him every year, and we pledge to move forward on the path he showed for establishing a liberal democratic Bangladesh,” he said. Referring to the upcoming national election, the BNP leader said the election has been scheduled for 12 February. “After a student-public uprising forced fascist Hasina to flee, we are now taking a fresh oath to rebuild an economy devastated by misrule and to institutionalise democracy.” Through this oath, he said, the BNP and its all front and affiliated organisations are renewing their commitment to carrying forward and implementing the ideals of Ziaur Raham in Bangladesh.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/401337/fakhrul-bnp-confident-in-ec%E2%80%99s-ability-to-hold", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 494}

Trump has warned he will impose new tariffs on eight US allies – Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the UK – from February if they oppose his plan to take control of Greenland. He has described the island as vital for US security and has not ruled out using force, triggering strong criticism across Europe, reports UNB citing BBC. In a joint statement, the countries threatened with tariffs said Trump’s move could spark a “dangerous downward spiral” and undermine transatlantic relations. “We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland,” the statement said, stressing that Arctic security is a shared Nato interest and that sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. Writing on Facebook, Frederiksen said Europe wanted cooperation, not conflict, but would stand firm on its core values. “Europe will not be blackmailed,” she wrote. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he had spoken with Frederiksen, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte before holding talks with Trump. A Downing Street spokeswoman said Starmer made clear that Greenland’s security was a priority for all Nato members and that imposing tariffs on allies over collective security was wrong. Trump has threatened a 10% tariff on goods from the eight countries from February 1, with the possibility of raising it to 25% until a deal is reached. European leaders have warned the move would damage long-standing alliances, while public protests have already taken place in Denmark and Greenland against Trump’s takeover plan.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/401336/europe-rejects-trump-tariff-threat-over-greenland", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 293}

The BCB held talks in Dhaka at the weekend with ICC officials over the impasse, but no agreement was reached. \"During the discussions, the BCB reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh's matches to Sri Lanka,\" a BCB statement said. The ICC have not officially commented, but website Cricinfo and other Indian media reported on Monday that the deadline of Wednesday had been set for Dhaka to make a decision.

One suggestion was for Bangladesh to swap with Group B's Ireland, whose matches are in Sri Lanka. \"Among other points, the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed,\" said the BCB. Pakistan will play all their matches in Colombo under an ICC agreement with India to play at neutral venues in global or regional tournaments.

Voters are being moved from one area to another to ensure victory,” he alleged, adding that he did not want to name the group so as not to give it publicity. Another Chhatra Dal leader claimed that groups associated with Ducsu, Rucsu and other university student unions had previously seized power through what he termed “election engineering” and were now attempting to apply the same tactics in the upcoming national election. “This conspiracy will not be allowed to succeed,” he said.

If they think they can get Pep Guardiola, I would say there's not a big chance.\" The one-time Borussia Dortmund coach dismissed rumours linking him to the Real dugout as media speculation. \"I'm in a place, as a person, where I'm completely at peace with where I am. I don't want to be somewhere else. \"I don't get up and excited if Real Madrid are showing interest -- if they would be -- but it's the media.\" Klopp won an array of trophies including league titles in England and Germany along with the Champions League with Liverpool, but said he still felt his time as a manager was over. \"Do I want to coach again? At the moment I would say no, but I cannot say never, never, never. \"I don't expect to change my mind, but I don't know.\"", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/football/401322/klopp-surprised-and-not-surprised-by-alonso-s", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 386}
{"title": "Senegal stun hosts Morocco to win Afcon title after final walk-off protest", "body": "A chaotic end to the match marred by the eventual champions storming off the pitch in a lengthy protest following a controversial late penalty award Senegal stunned Morocco in Sunday's Africa Cup of Nations final as Pape Gueye's extra-time goal gave them a 1-0 win over the hosts after a chaotic end to the match marred by the eventual champions storming off the pitch in a lengthy protest following a controversial late penalty award. Brahim Diaz could have won the trophy for Morocco when he stepped up to take the spot-kick in the 24th added minute of added time at the end of the initial 90 minutes as ugly scenes broke out in the crowd and press box. But Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy easily saved the weak attempted 'Panenka' chip by the Real Madrid winger, who was clearly distracted by the long delay that followed the penalty award. \"We gave everything. We didn't cheat,\" match-winner Gueye told French broadcaster M6. \"It was a really difficult match but we were determined to win here. This is a beautiful country and they have incredible supporters. \"Senegal are champions of Africa and we are so happy.\" Congolese match referee Jean-Jacques Ndala gave the penalty right at the end of the allotted eight added minutes following a VAR check for a challenge on Diaz in the box by Senegal defender El Hadji Malick Diouf. Diaz, the rest of the Moroccan team and their bench vehemently protested to the referee to check the images, but the decision to eventually give the spot-kick was met with fury by Senegal and their fans. As most of their players walked off the pitch, some Senegal supporters in the small section of away fans at the opposite end of the stadium threw chairs and other objects and attempted to get onto the field of play. They were eventually contained by a large barrier of police and stewards, and their anger turned to delight and disbelief when the penalty was saved after the game restarted. The Senegal team had initially been riled by the referee's decision to disallow for a foul a goal scored by Ismaila Sarr in the second added minute. Gueye the hero After Diaz's penalty miss, however, it felt almost inevitable that a galvanised Senegal would go on to score, and they did so in the fourth minute of extra time to stun the home fans in the crowd of 66,526 at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium. Sadio Mane won possession in midfield and found Idrissa Gana Gueye, who released his namesake Pape Gueye. The Villarreal midfielder held off Moroccan captain Achraf Hakimi as he advanced towards the box before beating goalkeeper Yassine Bounou with a superb strike into the top corner, leaving the hosts distraught. They could still have forced a penalty shoot-out, with Nayef Aguerd heading against the crossbar in the second half of extra time. But it was not to be for Morocco, who had been dreaming of winning the title in front of their own fans to end a 50-year wait to become African champions for just the second time. Senegal held on, and it is their second Cup of Nations title in the last three editions, after they defeated Egypt on penalties in Yaounde in 2022 to win the trophy for the very first time. They can now look forward to the World Cup, and will hope to persuade star man Mane to play at another Afcon after he declared that the final would be his last ever game at the tournament. Morocco coach Walid Regragui said: \"Congratulations to Senegal, but the image we gave of African football is disappointing, with everything that happened when the penalty was given.\" Any investigation into the disgraceful scenes will focus on the conduct of the Senegal team and their fans as well as any shortcomings by Moroccan organisers. The incidents came at the end of a tense final low on goalmouth action -- not exactly surprising given the defensive strength of Africa's best teams according to the Fifa rankings. Senegal's Iliman Ndiaye was denied by Bounou from the best chance in the first half, while Morocco should have scored just before the hour mark but Ayoub El Kaabi prodded wide from a Bilal El Khannouss cross. Then came the late drama, with Senegal surviving the penalty award before Gueye became their hero -- remarkably that was the first goal scored by Senegal in an Afcon final after they had failed to find the net in any of their three previous appearances in the tournament's deciding game. It was an agonising way for Morocco's campaign to end, and many of their fans left the stadium before the final whistle on a cold and wet night in Rabat.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/football/401321/senegal-stun-hosts-morocco-to-win-afcon-title", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 791}

{"title": "Regulating battery-powered vehicles", "body": "We need them registered and regulated, for the betterment of the entire country With streets across the country increasingly dominated by battery-powered rickshaws and e-bikes, the question must be asked: Has this transport revolution, which has unquestionably reduced physical labour for hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshis no longer needing to haul vehicles, outpaced the state’s ability to govern? Battery-powered rickshaws have been deemed unsafe from the moment they were on the streets. With drivers regularly flouting traffic rules at alarming speeds, it has become more urgent than ever to have some sort of regulation around them. As things currently stand, with millions of battery-powered vehicles operating nationwide, what began as an affordable mobility option has unfortunately metastasized into a crisis of lawlessness and power theft. It is the illegal charging points siphoning electricity, unregistered factories producing rickshaws, and informal garages dismantling expired lead-acid batteries that are some of the glaring issues that must be addressed. We understand that banning these vehicles outright was never the solution, and attempts to do so in the past have predictably failed. However, while there are countless individuals who rely on them for livelihoods and affordable transport, the solution has to be regulation. Here again, it is the job of the law enforcement agencies to do better, and not only ensure regulations but crack down on the garages and illegal charging points and factories that make these vehicles a liability rather than an asset for the nation. For too long have we let battery-powered vehicles operate unchecked - yet again we are trading short-term convenience for long-term catastrophe.

{"title": "Healthcare must be a priority", "body": "Healthcare should never be a privilege With Bangladesh looking ahead eagerly towards a new political chapter, and with numerous parties and leaders expressing their views on the best course of action for the nation, there are several issues that must stand above partisan divides. Of those, ensuring better healthcare for the people of this country must be placed at the centre of the next government’s agenda. It is truly shocking that quality, affordable care has become a distant dream for most people. While we cannot expect our healthcare system to transform overnight, what we do need is acceptance that we are lagging behind, and then for the government to begin addressing the issues that plague it immediately. As things stand, Bangladesh’s health system remains underfunded and overstretched, with the sector spending below 3% of GDP - far short of benchmarks. Such chronic underinvestment is the reason why citizens continue to shoulder soaring medical costs out of pocket, pushing countless families into poverty. In particular, healthcare is where the inequities within the country are particularly stark, with urban centres enjoying better-equipped hospitals while rural clinics routinely struggle with shortages of doctors, medicines, and diagnostic tools. However, with a country’s doctor-to-patient ratio that remains among the lowest in South Asia, it is the entire system that has all but failed the people, resulting in a population perpetually weakened. From raising health expenditure to expanding primary care facilities in rural areas, from ensuring medicines and diagnostics are available to starting to introduce health insurance schemes to reduce household burdens - these are all steps that can be taken moving forward. Equally vital is investment in medical education alongside more robust preventive campaigns so that we are not always playing catch-up when healthcare crises are upon us. Healthcare should never be a privilege, and the next government must recognize that investing in health is investing in our future.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/401318/healthcare-must-be-a-priority", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 314}
{"title": "Between hysteria and denial: Rethinking national security in Bangladesh", "body": "When people start to think that every mention of extremism is just a trick, they ignore real warning signs When people think about Bangladesh’s national security, they often picture the loud stuff: Checkpoints, raids, and the kind of breaking news that arrives after something has already gone wrong. But there’s another side that stays mostly invisible until it suddenly isn’t: A Facebook page quietly normalizing a militant worldview, a “training” video passed around in private groups, a small self-defense circle meeting somewhere in a neighbourhood or a distant village. Each piece, on its own, looks easy to ignore. Together, they form a pattern. Look at how quickly the quiet becomes concrete. A blast in Shariatpur killed a 20-year-old on January 8, 2026. It had left two others critically injured. On December 28, 2025, we saw another explosion at a madrasa in South Keraniganj. Police recovered bomb-like objects and a large volume of chemicals. In both cases, law enforcement agencies suspect that these people were trying to make bombs. In one case, a suspect had prior extremist links. Lately, if you scroll through reels or short videos, you may have noticed a pattern. Clips of so-called “Islamic State training,” Al-Qaeda style footage, or battlefield montages appear in your feed, often with Bangla subtitles and dramatic background music. Many of the accounts that post them are new, opened in the last year or so, and they follow each other closely, forming a small ecosystem. Alongside this, there are pages advertising martial arts or “fitness training for young Muslims,” where the language in the caption or the comments moves beyond health and discipline and starts hinting at a more ideological goal: Prepare yourself for a different kind of struggle. If you look at any one of these in isolation, you can easily shrug. Someone is farming clicks. Someone else is trying to monetize religious sentiment. Some young men want to learn karate. Fair enough. But once you start connecting the dots, a different picture appears. You can see a cluster of accounts feeding off the same imagery, recycling the same slogans, and slowly normalizing the idea that physical training plus a certain kind of religious rhetoric equals a higher, almost militant, purpose. That is the point where the question of national security enters. Bangladesh has already paid a heavy price for underestimating these patterns. We do not need to guess what can happen when fringe ideas are left to grow without monitoring. In August 2005, Jama’atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) carried out near-simultaneous bomb blasts in 63 districts in a single day. It was a coordinated message: “We are everywhere.” For years before that, there had been smaller incidents, pamphlets, and whispers about rising militancy. Many dismissed them as isolated or exaggerated. The bombs proved otherwise. A decade later, in July 2016, the Holey Artisan attack in Dhaka’s diplomatic zone shocked the country again. Whatever people think about how the incident was later used politically by the then government, the core fact cannot be wished away: Armed young men stormed a café, killed Bangladeshi and foreign citizens, and pledged loyalty to a transnational jihadist project. Families lost their children. A sense of safety in the capital was badly shaken. Pretending this was just “theatre” or “drama” is not only disrespectful to victims, it also weakens our ability to see similar risks when they reappear in new forms. Since then, law enforcement and intelligence agencies have kept many militant outfits under pressure. There is no question that some plots have been disrupted and some networks dismantled. At the same time, there is also a widely shared perception that counter-terror laws and special units were sometimes turned inward with political motives. Sometimes they have been used against political opponents rather than genuine extremist threats. Reports by local and international bodies have documented how tools built to fight terrorism were used to manage elections, protests, or party rivalries. So we ended up in a strange situation: Some citizens began to believe that “terrorism” itself is a political fiction, a tool to attack opposition, rather than a real danger. This belief is risky in its own way. When people start to think that every mention of extremism is just a trick, they ignore real warning signs. So, if you bring up concerns about Islamic State videos in Bangla, unexplained explosions in religious places, or secret training camps disguised as gyms, people may dismiss you as repeating an old story. They say: “We have heard this before. It’s just another excuse to control us.” This is where we need a more balanced and honest conversation. On one side, there are mainstream political parties like Awami League, BNP, Jamaat, NCP, and other leftist and centrist groups. Even though they often criticize each other, they mostly work within the rules of elections and the constitution. They compete for power through alliances, campaigns, and sometimes strikes or blockades, and occasionally through confrontation. But at their core, they agree that government should be decided through politics. On the other side, there are smaller networks that do not fully accept the framework of the Bangladesh Republic. For them, the dream is not a more democratic or more accountable Bangladesh, but a fundamentally different kind of state based on a particular interpretation of Islam. Their language rejects compromise and coexistence, the core idea of their religion. Their heroes are not parliamentarians or community organizers, but fighters in distant wars on the Afghan-Pakistan border. They are patient, they invest in teaching, preaching, training, and slow recruitment, and they have learned to use online platforms very well. These actors do not need a large visible presence to create damage; even a handful of committed individuals can change the security calculus. The challenge for the state is to respond without repeating past mistakes. If the state apparatus considers every critical voice, every religious activist, every student group as a potential terrorist and a threat to national security, we will end up exactly where we were before. It will lead to the abuse of laws and damage trust in institutions. The public will refuse to believe any warning, even when it is genuine. On the other hand, if the state swings to the opposite extreme and assumes that all talk of extremism is just “fear-mongering by the old regime,” we will keep walking with our eyes closed while new networks quietly organize. A more constructive approach First , it means taking online ecosystems seriously without panicking about every post. The government has the capacity to map clusters of pages and accounts that systematically push violent jihadist content in Bangla for a wider audience. Most of these pages are new, anonymous, and mutually linked. That kind of analysis is different from blanket surveillance of everyone. It is closer to good policing: Identify patterns, look at behaviour over time, and focus only on those who are clearly endorsing or glorifying organized violence. Second , it means treating educational and religious institutions as partners, not suspects. When an explosion happens in a madrasa compound, the question should not end with a short news item. Citizens deserve clear answers regarding such events: Who brought explosives there, why they were stored, and which networks were involved. Transparency is a must in such cases. At the same time, most madrasas and mosques are not part of any violent plot. They are often the victims of fringe groups who use these platforms as their hiding place. Madrasas and universities are spaces where millions of families send their children in good faith. Bringing their teachers and administrators into a transparent conversation about safety is far more effective than demonizing them from a distance. Third , it requires a clean separation between counter-terror work and partisan politics. If the same unit that investigates bomb-making also raids opposition offices on election eve, citizens' confidence will never recover. They will not trust these specialized groups that are created to fight terrorism. A democratic state has every right to defend itself against groups that reject peaceful politics, but it has to do so under clear legal rules, judicial oversight, and with space for media and civil society to ask questions. National security cannot become a magic word that ends all debate. Finally , there is a social side to this issue. Young people who get involved with extremist pages or training groups are often not villains. Many are looking for meaning, respect, and a sense of strength in a society and political system that can be disappointing. If mainstream institutions cannot give them a real sense of purpose, others will step in. Solving this is not about propaganda; it is about creating real ways for people to take part, fair policing, and making sure everyone feels the system, though imperfect, still belongs to them. In the end, the idea is simple. Bangladesh will be safest when all major political groups, from the secular left to the religious right, compete openly under democratic rules. The small minority that rejects these rules should be watched closely, dealt with by law, and given chances to change when possible. This is not weakness; it is strategic patience. So when you see another “training” reel with familiar black flags and Bangla subtitles while scrolling your social media, it is worth pausing for a second. Maybe it is just clickbait. A responsible state and government does not jump to conclusions, but neither does it ignore the recurring pattern. Between hysteria and denial, the Bangladesh government needs to find a middle path. National security thinking should be prioritized. Asif Bin Ali is an Atlanta based geopolitical analyst and currently working with Georgia State University, USA.

{"title": "When Tehran burns, the world feels the heat", "body": "Geopolitics knows no geographical borders The Iranian streets are in uproar. What started as demonstrations due to economic difficulties and the political frustrations turned into one of the gravest domestic issues faced by the Iranian state in years. The violent crackdown on protesters, the news of thousands of demonstrators murdered, has not only rattled the Iranian society but also plunged it into a renewed risky confrontation with the United States. Donald Trump renewed threats against Tehran, warning of consequences over the killing of protesters. Tehran also warned Washington it would attack US bases all over the Middle East. If war breaks out between the US and Iran, it will have repercussions all over the world. The ripple effect of internal repression and external pressure, particularly by Washington, affects global markets, and eventually countries like Bangladesh suffer from higher prices and low growth. Iran is at the centre of the world energy map. Not only is it a force that produces oil, but it is also adjacent to the Strait of Hormuz where much of the oil and gas that is shipped in the world passes daily. The threat of regional escalation is always high whenever Iran feels surrounded in some way by sanctions, protests, or foreign threats. This is instinctively comprehended by markets. The oil prices are built upon fear because oil prices do not wait till the bombs fall. The recent protests and Trump’s threats have already rekindled those fears. Investors understand it is a regime under internal pressure which is more unpredictable. To the world economy, the consequences are not new yet they are also not any less grave. An increase in oil prices introduces inflation, slows down growth, and makes monetary policy more difficult across the globe. In the case of developing countries, the damage is more acute. They bring in inflation without bringing influence. Bangladesh is one of them as it imports most of its fuel. Any increase in world oil prices has a direct impact of increasing the import bill, reducing foreign exchange reserves, and exerting pressure on the taka. Once oil is made costly, the price of transportation increases as does the cost of electricity production and eventually food prices. Ordinary citizens are left with the greatest burden. It is not some abstract issue. Bangladesh is already facing the pressure of inflation, weak currency, and limited liquidity of dollars. An energy shock emitted by the instability of the Middle East would be fuel to an already burning fire. They can discuss buffers and adjustments, but the fact is that imported inflation is difficult to neutralize in a consumer-based economy. Energy is not the only potential risk. Another weakness is the deep labour and remittance relationships that Bangladesh has with the Middle East. Hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi labourers make their living in Gulf nations, countries whose economies strongly depend on the stability of the region. Remittance flows thus may decrease in case instability in Iran leads to greater regional tension or if sanctions and counter-sanctions affect the economies in the Gulf. In the case of Bangladesh, it will translate into a strain both on household incomes and foreign exchange reserves. Exports are equally exposed. The garment industry in Bangladesh relies on consistent world demand and a reliable supply chain. The cost of fuel rising raises the costs of shipping and insurance. Lack of confidence in the world markets decreases consumer expenditure in the Western market. Combined, these forces put export competitiveness on a squeezer at both ends. Once imports are more expensive and exports are not doing well, the balance of payments becomes dangerously constrained. The Iranian unrest has a larger lesson to Bangladesh and other developing countries. They emphasize that economic hardship coupled with political inflexibility may result in instability of the global scale. The protesters in Iran are fueled by not only the political oppression but also the lack of jobs, high inflation rates, and scuttled opportunities. These pressures have been exacerbated by sanctions though the failure of governance has increased these strains. The reality is that Bangladesh cannot do much about what is happening. Bangladesh does not shape oil prices. The relationship between the US and Iran is not something Bangladesh can control. As such, the diversification of energy can no longer be a future goal. Being less reliant on imported fossil fuels, encouraging greater development of renewables, and energy efficiency are targets we must strive for. The diversification of exports must also be explored; our economy is vulnerable as it depends on one area during times of global uncertainties. Social resilience has a lesson associated with it, too as it is the poorest who are injured by external shocks. Bangladesh might appear to be miles away but time and again, history tells us that geopolitics knows no geographical borders. The fires of Iran and the language of Washington are yet to find their way down into Dhaka, but economically, their heat is already being experienced.

{"title": "Running on empty", "body": "Bangladesh is discovering that energy security is inseparable from national security Bangladesh’s gas crisis did not arrive as a sudden shock; it crept in quietly, disguised as policy pragmatism and short-term fixes, until it became a structural threat to the economy. What is unfolding now is not merely a seasonal shortage or a logistical hiccup, but the cumulative consequence of years of strategic neglect, compounded by global volatility and domestic inertia. The numbers alone tell a story of exhaustion. The country currently demands around 3.8 billion cubic feet of gas per day, while supply lingers at roughly 2.58 billion cubic feet, leaving a daily deficit of 1.22 billion cubic feet. Even compared to the same period last year, supply has fallen by 176 million cubic feet per day. For an economy whose industrial backbone, power generation, and fertilizer production depend overwhelmingly on gas, this gap is not technical; it is existential. The roots of this imbalance lie in a policy choice made years ago: To manage scarcity through imports rather than confront it through exploration. During the previous government’s tenure, liquefied natural gas was elevated from a stopgap solution to a structural pillar of energy policy. Instead of aggressively investing in onshore and offshore exploration, Bangladesh chose the predictability of foreign cargoes, even as global energy markets grew more volatile and geopolitics more intrusive. The financial cost of this choice is staggering. Since the 2018–19 fiscal year, the country has spent or committed to spend more than Tk 2.56 trillion on LNG imports. In the current fiscal year alone, plans are in place to import 115 cargoes at an estimated cost of Tk 51,540 crore, significantly higher than the previous year. These figures reflect not only rising volumes, but also the growing price of dependency. Meanwhile, domestic production has been quietly eroding. Four of the five companies extracting gas in Bangladesh have recorded declines over the past year. Bangladesh Gas Fields Company Limited saw production fall by more than 500 million cubic metres year-on-year. Bapex’s output dropped by around 14%. Even Chevron, which supplies nearly half of the country’s gas through its three onshore fields, experienced a decline of over one billion cubic metres in a single year. Only one operator showed a marginal increase, insufficient to offset the broader trend. This is not a coincidence; it is what depletion looks like when exploration stagnates and development lags behind demand growth. Adding to this fragility is inefficiency within the system itself. Around 150 million cubic feet of gas is reportedly lost from the grid every day due to leaks, technical losses, and mismanagement. In such a scenario, drilling new wells without fixing transmission and distribution inefficiencies is akin to pouring water into a cracked vessel. The result is predictable: New supply fails to translate into meaningful relief, while costs continue to rise. The interim government inherited this crisis with high public expectations. As a caretaker authority overseeing a critical political transition, it was seen as uniquely positioned to take difficult, long-term decisions insulated from electoral pressures. Energy, the lifeblood of the economy, was expected to be an early priority. Yet more than a year into its tenure, the crisis appears deeper, not eased. Import dependence remains entrenched, local production continues to decline, and infrastructure expansion has barely moved beyond announcements. Two floating LNG terminals currently supply the grid, together capable of handling about one billion cubic feet per day. This capacity is already insufficient, yet tangible progress on new terminals remains elusive. Building another floating terminal, even if approved today, would take at least three years to become operational. By then, the interim government will be long gone, and the political cost deferred to an elected successor. This pattern of postponement, where today’s inaction becomes tomorrow’s inherited problem, has become a recurring feature of Bangladesh’s energy governance. The risks of this approach extend beyond balance sheets. Global energy markets are increasingly shaped by sanctions, conflicts, and strategic rivalries. Recent disruptions in LPG supply, triggered by sanctions affecting shipping and trading routes, offer a glimpse of how external events can suddenly constrict access to fuel. For a country that imports a growing share of its primary energy, such shocks can quickly cascade through the economy, shutting down factories, reducing export capacity, and straining foreign exchange reserves. Bangladesh is discovering, belatedly, that energy security is inseparable from national security. The industrial impact is already visible. Many factories operate for months without adequate gas pressure; others have shut down entirely. Power plants built at great cost sit underutilized for lack of fuel. Export-oriented industries, particularly those competing on thin margins, face rising production costs and declining reliability. At a time when Bangladesh seeks to attract foreign investment and diversify its economy, persistent energy shortages send a deeply discouraging signal. Investors may tolerate policy uncertainty; they rarely tolerate unreliable energy. To be fair, plans do exist. An integrated energy roadmap stretching from 2026 to 2050 envisions phased reforms and investments worth an estimated $70-80 billion. There are promises of drilling 100 wells by 2028, purchasing new rigs, updating production-sharing contracts, and reducing reliance on spot LNG through short-term agreements. These are not trivial measures. Yet plans, in the absence of urgency and coordination, risk becoming another layer of deferred responsibility. Energy systems do not respond to intent; they respond to execution. What is most troubling is the continued absence of a clear exit strategy from LNG dependency. Importing LNG can stabilize supply in the short run, but it cannot anchor an economy indefinitely, especially one vulnerable to currency pressure and external shocks. Without a defined timeline to reduce imports and replace them with domestic production, LNG risks becoming a permanent crutch, draining public finances while crowding out investment in exploration. The opportunity cost is immense. Every taka spent on expensive spot cargoes is a taka not invested in seismic surveys, offshore drilling, or modern grid management. Bangladesh’s gas story is ultimately a lesson in policy time horizons. Exploration does not yield immediate political dividends; imports do. Infrastructure takes years; cargoes arrive in weeks. But nations that prioritize convenience over capacity eventually pay a higher price. The current crisis is not merely about gas shortages; it is about the erosion of strategic autonomy. An economy that cannot fuel its factories without navigating sanctions regimes and shipping constraints is an economy exposed to forces beyond its control. The interim government still has limited time to shape the contours of what comes next. Even if it cannot deliver immediate relief, it can establish credibility by locking in irreversible steps toward exploration, efficiency, and diversification. Failing that, the burden will fall on the next elected government, which will inherit not only depleted fields and expensive contracts, but also public frustration and industrial fatigue. Bangladesh once built its growth narrative on affordable energy. That advantage is slipping away. Reclaiming it will require more than cargoes and committees; it will require a decisive break from the politics of postponement. Without that, the country risks running its economy on empty, sustained by imports, vulnerable to shocks, and perpetually one crisis away from paralysis.

{"title": "90th birth anniversary of Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman being celebrated", "body": "He founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on September 1, 1978 The 90th birth anniversary of the architect of multi-party democracy and founder of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman, Bir Uttam, is being celebrated on Monday. Ziaur Rahman, also the proclaimer of Bangladesh's independence and an architect of modern Bangladesh, was born on January 19, 1936, in Bagbari village under Nashipur Union in Gabtoli of Bogra district. Ziaur Rahman was the second of five sons of Chemist Mansur Rahman and Jahanara Khatun. His nickname was Kamol. On the eventful November 7, 1975, Ziaur Rahman came to the centre of the state power. President Ziaur Rahman founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on September 1, 1978. The former president was assassinated by a group of misguided army personnel on May 30, 1981. BNP will observe the birth anniversary of its founder with a two-day program beginning Monday. Marking the anniversary, party flags were hoisted at the central office and all party offices nationwide at the dawn. Party leaders and activists from all levels, along with members of the BNP National Standing Committee, will lay wreaths and offer \"Fatiha\" at the mausoleum of Shaheed President Ziaur Rahman in the city's Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area at 11am today. Doctors' Association of Bangladesh (DAB) will organize a medical camp to mark the birth anniversary. A discussion will be held at 11am on January 20, at the Institution of Diploma Engineers Bangladesh (IDEB) auditorium in the capital's Kakrail. Senior BNP leaders and prominent national figures will join it. Simultaneously, discussion meetings and 'dua mahfils' will be organized by BNP and its associate bodies and front organizations at district, metropolitan, upazila, and thana-level across the country. Posters have been prepared, while special supplements were published in various national dailies today to mark the day. Ziaur Rahman, commander of the \"Z Force\" and Sector-1 during the country's War of Liberation is being remembered with due respect for his historic and unforgettable contribution, who later emerged as a seasoned and popular statesman. His uncompromised patriotism, steadfast commitment to democratic norms and values and profound love and respect for the country and its people endeared him to the nation, elevating him into a truly beloved and iconic figure. His leadership shaped the nation's political destiny. Ziaur Rahman spent his childhood in Kolkata, where his father, Mansur Rahman, served as a scientific officer of the then British government. He studied up to class seven at Hare School, one of the oldest and most prestigious educational institutions, located at 87 College Street and founded by renowned educational reformer David Hare in Kolkata. After the Partition in 1947, Ziaur Rahman moved to Karachi with his family, where he continued his studies at DJ Sindh Government Science College, a historic institution, established in 1887. While studying at the College, he joined the Pakistan Military Academy as an officer cadet in 1953 and received commando training as a second lieutenant in 1955. Ziaur Rahman joined the second batch of the East Bengal Regiment at Joydebpur Sub-Cantonment, near Dhaka as second-in-command in April 1967 and in the same year, he proceeded to West Germany for advanced military training. In September 1970, he was posted to Chittagong (now Chattogram), with his base at Sholoshahar Bazar. On March 25, 1971, the Pakistani occupation forces swooped on the armless people of the East Pakistan and soon he joined the Liberation War. On the nation's darkest day in 1971, his unforgettable voice -- I, Major Zia, do hereby declare -- infused among countless hearts the hope and courage to wage the Liberation War. Keeping aside the love and affection for his wife and sons, he devoted himself in mobilising the armed resistance against the occupation force,s raising the \"Z Force\", and dutifully served as the commander of Sector No. 1, established in initial period of the war. In recognition of his extraordinary valour, he was later awarded the gallantry 'Bir Uttam' title. Despite the multiple changes of power following the August 1975 change of political landscape, Ziaur Rahman remained steadfast in carrying out professional duties which he was entrusted with by the state amid the turbulences in the military forces. Amidst the turbulence within the army on November 3, 1975, a group imprisoned him at his house but on November 7, he was freed in the historic revolution of sepoys-people and eventually entrusted with the charge of leading the state. After taking charge as the President, he introduced multiparty democracy, ending the one-party BAKSAL rule imposed by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman through the Fourth Amendment to the constitution on January 25 in 1975, which restricted all newspapers except four. Ziaur Rahman later restored freedom of the press and expression by lifting the ban through the Fifth Amendment to the constitution. He assumed the Office of President on April 21, 1977 and was subsequently elected to presidency as the head of the state and government on June 23, 1978, defeating Awami League-backed candidate Liberation War Commander-in-Chief General MAG Osmani, by a wide margin in a free, fair and competitive election. Ziaur Rahman also revitalised political parties to restore democracy, founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) in 1978 and introduced the 19-point programme, a new development framework, reflecting his party's political philosophy. He immediately set an example by restoring law and order across the country, decisively curbing corruption and all forms of crime, including theft, robbery, mugging, and hijacking restoring a sense of security public confidence in a short time. On May 30, 1981, Ziaur Rahman was assassinated in an abortive military coup.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/401314/90th-birth-anniversary-of-shaheed-president-ziaur", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 923}
{"title": "Chuadanga’s centuries-old molasses haat comes alive in winter", "body": "Nearly 300 years old, Sarojganj Haat holds its twice-weekly market sessions on Mondays and Fridays In the middle of winter, trading activity has surged at the historic Sarojganj date molasses market in Chuadanga, one of Bangladesh’s most renowned traditional haats for palm jaggery, with the aroma of freshly boiled sap filling the air. Nearly 300 years old, Sarojganj Haat holds its twice-weekly market sessions on Mondays and Fridays, and during the peak season, it now records transactions worth more than Tk1 crore weekly. On each market day, sales range between Tk1.5 crore and Tk2 crore. If the current momentum continues, total transactions this season are expected to reach Tk 50–55 crore, according to local traders. A visit to the haat presents a vibrant tableau of rural commerce. Earthen pots brimming with liquid jaggery line the stalls, while freshly made nolen patali are neatly stacked alongside newly produced molasses displayed in bamboo baskets and wooden frames. Buyers and sellers engage in animated bargaining, their calls echoing through the market. Renowned for its distinctive taste, rich colour and natural aroma, Sarojganj’s date molasses enjoys strong demand across the country. Retail prices currently range from Tk230 to Tk350 per kilogram, depending on quality. Earthen pots weighing between 12 and 16 kilograms sell for Tk1,800 to Tk2,600, while different varieties of nolen patali fetch between Tk300 and Tk430. Molasses collected from the haat is supplied to a wide network of districts, including Dhaka, Kushtia, Meherpur, Jhenaidah, Pabna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, Barishal, Sylhet, Khulna, Mymensingh, Magura, Rajbari and Panchagarh. Sazzad Hossain, a molasses producer from Sarabaria village in Chuadanga Sadar upazila, said the jaggery is prepared using traditional methods passed down through generations. “Sap collected from date palm trees is boiled in traditional ovens using tin strainers. When the sap thickens, it is stirred continuously to make molasses. We have been producing pure jaggery using this age-old method for generations,” he said. On market days, sellers arrive with their produce by bicycle, van or even carrying heavy earthen pots on their heads. Buyers carefully examine the colour, thickness and overall quality before finalising their purchases. Shahidul Islam, a trader from Pabna, said he returns to Sarojganj every year because of the product’s purity. “The price is a bit higher, but the quality is superior,” he said. Date palm farmer Jamal Uddin from Baliakandi village in Chuadanga Sadar said he is collecting sap from 35 palm trees this season and expects to produce around 400 to 500 kilograms of molasses. Local trader Ujjal Kumar Adhikari described Sarojganj Haat as one of the largest molasses markets in the country, operating continuously for nearly three centuries through generations of traders and producers. Haat operator Md Alauddin Ala said traders from across Bangladesh, including Dhaka and Chittagong, regularly attend the market. “Each haat sees transactions worth Tk 1.5 crore to 2 crore, and we ensure the safety of both buyers and sellers,” he said. According to the Department of Agricultural Extension (DAE) in Chuadanga, sap is being collected from around 2,72,000 date palm trees in the district this season, with a production target of 2,700 metric tonnes of molasses. Deputy Director Md Masudur Rahman Sarkar said farmers are producing pure, sugar-free molasses and that regular monitoring is being conducted to prevent adulteration. Locals said trading at the Sarojganj date molasses market will continue in full swing until Chaitra, promising yet another successful winter season for this historic marketplace that remains a symbol of Chuadanga’s rich agrarian heritage.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/nation/401313/chuadanga%E2%80%99s-centuries-old-molasses-haat-comes", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 577}

The disaster struck on Sunday evening when a service travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz, crossing onto the other track where it crashed into an oncoming train, which also derailed, Spain's Adif rail network operator posted on X. A police spokesperson told AFP that 21 people had died. Antonio Sanz, the top emergencies official in Andalusia, told a press conference that at least 73 people had been injured. \"The situation is likely to see the death toll increase,\" he said, adding that \"a very complicated night awaits us\". Transport Minister Oscar Puente told reporters that 30 people were rushed to hospital in serious condition, adding that all the injured had been evacuated to receive care. The disaster took place on a straight part of the track, which was completely renovated, Puente said, adding that the first train to derail was \"practically new\", making the accident \"extremely strange\". Rail operator Iryo said around 300 people were on board its Malaga-Madrid service. The hundreds of passengers left in the wreckage hampered the frantic work of emergency services. \"The problem is that the carriages are twisted, so the metal is twisted with the people inside,\" Francisco Carmona, head of firefighters in Cordoba, told public broadcaster RTVE. \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work,\" he added. Some of the carriages had tumbled down an embankment of four metres, Sanz said at his press conference. A passenger on the second train, bound for the city of Huelva, who gave only her first name, Montse, told Spanish public television the train, \"with a jolt, came to a complete stop, and everything went dark\". She described being thrown around in the last carriage and seeing luggage tumble on other passengers. \"The attendant behind me hit her head and was bleeding. There were children crying,\" she added. \"Luckily, I was in the last car. I feel like I was given a second chance at life.\" Survivor Lucas Meriako, who was travelling on the first train that derailed, told La Sexta television that \"this looks like a horror movie\". \"We felt a very strong hit from behind and the feeling that the whole train was about to collapse, break... there were many injured due to the glass,\" he said. High-speed services between Madrid and the Andalusian cities of Cordoba, Seville, Malaga and Huelva would be suspended for the entirety of Monday at least, Adif announced. Adif said spaces had been set up at stations in Madrid, Seville, Cordoba, Malaga and Huelva to assist the relatives of victims. The defence ministry said it was sending around 40 members of its emergencies military unit and some 15 vehicles to the site of the accident. \"Today is a night of deep pain for our country owing to the tragic rail accident in Adamuz,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez wrote on X. \"No words can alleviate such great suffering, but I want them to know that the whole country is by their side in this tough moment,\" he added. The royal palace said on X that Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were following the news \"with great concern\", offering \"our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured\". French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen were among the world leaders offering condolences. Spain boasts Europe's largest high-speed rail network, with more than 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) of dedicated tracks connecting major cities including Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, and Malaga. In 2013, a high-speed train derailment outside the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela killed 80 people and injured more than 140 -- Spain's deadliest such tragedy since 1944.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/world/europe/401311/train-collision-in-spain-kills-21-injures-dozens", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 679}

The city’s air was classified as \"very unhealthy,\" indicating a serious health threat, according to the AQI report. Delhi in India, Lahore in Pakistan, and Kolkata in India occupied the first, second, and fourth spots on the list, with AQI scores of 541, 312, and 204 respectively. According to the AQI scale, a reading between 50 and 100 is considered ‘moderate’, with generally acceptable air quality, though sensitive individuals should limit prolonged outdoor exertion. AQI levels of 101–150 are ‘unhealthy for sensitive groups’, 151–200 is ‘unhealthy’, 201–300 is ‘very unhealthy’, and readings above 301 are considered ‘hazardous’, posing severe health risks. The AQI, which reports daily air quality, informs residents how clean or polluted the air is and highlights potential health effects. In Bangladesh, the AQI is calculated based on five key pollutants: particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone. Dhaka has long struggled with air pollution. Air quality usually deteriorates in winter and improves during the monsoon season. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that air pollution causes about seven million deaths worldwide each year, primarily from stroke, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and acute respiratory infections.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/dhaka/401310/dhaka-air-3rd-most-polluted-in-world-monday", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 231}

{"title": "Mirza Abbas: Coordinated bid underway to manipulate election results", "body": "Abbas alleged that in the constituencies where the small party plans to contest, measures are underway to ensure its victory in all those seats BNP Standing Committee member Mirza Abbas on Tuesday alleged that a major party and a small one are making coordinated attempts to influence the outcome of the national election in several constituencies. Speaking at a discussion meeting at the Diploma Engineers’ Institute in the capital, organised marking the 90th birth anniversary of former President Ziaur Rahman, Abbas made the allegations. “A ‘big party’ and another of its ‘offspring’ are engaged in the plot. I will not name them, but arrangements have already been made to carry out election engineering in several seats. This issue cannot be taken lightly,” he warned. Abbas alleged that in the constituencies where the small party plans to contest, measures are underway to ensure its victory in all those seats. “They have held discussions with the government at the highest level. Plans are being made on how to ensure their win in every seat. Their main objective is to make sure that BNP does not come to power.” Referring to participants of the July Mass Uprising, Abbas said some are now identifying themselves as ‘July fighters’ and aspiring to become ministers and enjoy power. “We fought in the Liberation War and played a role in the fall of Ershad, but we never coveted ministerial positions. These people lack political knowledge, yet they are impatient to grab power and ministerial posts.” Abbas further alleged that BNP is being subjected to rampant propaganda, with extortion being carried out in the party’s name. “Those involved in extortion have already been expelled from BNP. We know who the real extortionists are—I can name them one by one. They are in power and are the ones engaged in extortion, yet the blame is being shifted onto the BNP.” Outlining BNP’s electoral approach, Abbas said the party would go door to door to seek votes from the people. “With whatever manpower we have, we will reach voters at their doorsteps and ask for votes for BNP. Holding rallies and chanting slogans is the easiest part; winning an election is the hardest. That is the challenge we must take on.” He also urged BNP leaders and activists to remain vigilant against all forms of conspiracy, warning that forces opposed to Bangladesh in 1971 are once again re-emerging. Other BNP Standing Committee members present at the program called on party leaders and activists to uphold the ideals of Ziaur Rahman and work towards building a future Bangladesh under the leadership of Tarique Rahman.", "url": "https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/politics/401402/mirza-abbas-coordinated-bid-underway-to", "date": null, "language": "en", "tokens_count": 433}

The envoys of Norway, Sweden and Denmark in Dhaka first met Tarique around 11am at the BNP Chairman’s Gulshan office. Later, Russian Ambassador to Bangladesh Alexander Grigoryevich Khozin also held a meeting with the BNP chairman at the same office. BNP Joint Secretary General Humayun Kabir, Chairman’s Advisory Council member Dr Mahdi Amin, Press Secretary Saleh Shibly and BNP International Affairs Secretary Rashedul Haq were present at the meetings. Briefing reporters afterwards, Humayun Kabir said the meetings were courtesy calls and focused on issues of national interest, including ways to strengthen bilateral relations with friendly countries in the coming days. “I said yesterday (Monday) as well that there is special interest within the international community in BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman—both in his leadership and his vision for Bangladesh’s development,” he said. The BNP leader said the talks covered areas such as trade, investment, energy and education, as well as how BNP’s proposed 31-point reform programme could be implemented if the party receives a public mandate in the February-12 election. “We discussed how we can work together through foreign economic cooperation and strengthen bilateral relations in the interest of Bangladesh,” he said. Asked whether the upcoming election was discussed in detail, Humayun Kabir said there was no specific or technical discussion on the polls. “There was no detailed discussion on the election. But the diplomats showed interest in Bangladesh’s February 12 election and expressed hope that the country is moving towards a democratic space and democratic transition,” he said. Humayun said both the people of Bangladesh and the international community are hopeful about the restoration of democracy through a free, fair and credible election. “After 17 years, people are excited that they may finally get a real opportunity to cast their votes. In the same way, the international community is also excited that Bangladesh is moving towards democratic transition,” he said. Humayun Kabir said the envoys believe the election can create a genuine opportunity for people to participate in the democratic process. “In previous elections, people did not really get the chance to vote. This election can give Bangladeshi citizens the opportunity to exercise their voting rights,” he said. Replying to a question about Russia’s long-standing interest in selling defence equipment to Bangladesh, Humayun Kabir clarified that the issue did not come up in the meetings. “There was no discussion on defence equipment. No technical or detailed talks took place on that issue,” he said. Humayun Kabir described the meetings as introductory and cordial, noting that since Tarique Rahman’s political return on December 25, he has become a major focus of interest for the international community.
